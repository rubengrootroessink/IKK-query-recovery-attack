Jeff,

Today  I  had a good discussion with David Cox & Scott Yeager about EBS 
development and I'd like to share with you some of our ideas.

The meeting was influenced by our developing relationship with Microsoft.   I 
know that you are taking an active part in building our relationship with 
MSFT and thought  that it might be interesting for you to go through this 
internal discussion paper.  

Best regards,

Boris
