Mr. Collins, 

Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more 
information.  What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 
11?  Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 
12  that would be very difficult to reschedule.  Given this time constraint, 
I'm not sure it will work.  Please advise at your earliest convenience.  

Regards, 
Sherri Sera

Subject: RISK AWARDS PRESENTATION





I am sure you are aware that as part of  first ever Risk Awards - published 
in January - Enron Corporation achieved the  accolade: Energy/commodity 
derivatives house of the  year.

This award was won, not simply  because of your lead in energy and power in 
the US, but because of the lead  Enron has taken in new areas of risk 
management.

We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk 
2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the 
conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions 
which will be of interest to you. A formal invitation will  follow from our 
editor.

We also intend to publish a special  supplement that will provide Awards 
winners with an excellent opportunity to  celebrate their achievements 
through advertising.

This supplement will be distributed with the  March issue of Risk and to all 
delegates attending the Risk 2000  Congress.

I hope that my email is clear and I will  contact you shortly to find-out 
your reactions to our proposal - however if you  have any questions 
beforehand - please feel free to contact  me.

Kind regards,

?
