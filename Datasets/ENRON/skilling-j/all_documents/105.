Dear Hilda,

Jeff has asked me to forward Sophia's resume to Celeste Roberts, director of 
the associate and analyst program, and to Beth Tilney, who oversees 
recruiting for marketing and communication graduates.  They will review her 
resume and determine if there is a match between Enron's needs and Sophia's 
background and skillset.

Thank you, Hilda, for forwarding Sophia's resume.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling
