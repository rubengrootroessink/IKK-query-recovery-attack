Subject:  advanced arbitrage enabling technology out of Caltech




Jeff,


I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading.
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces,
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an
application and data source, to enable new business processes.



For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market
events. This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and
response to relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence
information environment.

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness
applications over last several years has established the  need and created
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta
Applications.

Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.
Thanks,

H. Enzo Olfati
Account Manager

P.S.?I have also  e-mailed this to others at Enron?to determine the
appropriate contacts  to?have the discussion  with.
