Blake, I've reserved one of our Falcon 900s for the trip, too.  It seats 12 
passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 
10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS

Ahoy,

Admiral Monteleone and I have been working on the arrangements for our
upcoming forum trip.  When we arrive in Nassau, both boats will be waiting
for us at Atlantis.  Consistent with prior events, this trip should be
outstanding.  Bill and I will present a proposed agenda on Monday night.  We
welcome your input.

-Blake
