Hi Jeff,

I've been asked by the Mayor's office (see email below) to confirm interest 
in a news conference on the search committee with the Mayor, yourself and 
possibly other committee members present. I'm happy to take the lead on 
organizing this - I just need some idea of timing on your end as well as your 
preference on participants.

Subject: HFD Search Committee - News Conference


Mr. Hollingsworth asked me to confirm that we were keeping the idea of a
news conference about the Search Committee in site.  He would like us to
begin negotiating for a spot on the Mayors calendar.  You mentioned that
January 19 was the goal to have the committee in place.  We need to
determine a date certain for selection of the members to schedule a press
release/conference.

Additionally, what has been the discussion regarding having Mr. Skilling or
other members of the Committee present at the news conference? What are the
scheduling issues with this aspect?

I have included Monette Goodrich in this conversation.  She is the Mayors
Communication Director and will be handling the press release and news
conference.
