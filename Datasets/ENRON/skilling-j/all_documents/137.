Dear Jeff,

Several weeks ago I sent you the draft of a chapter on you in my
forthcoming book
on great problem solvers.  By sending you a courtesy copy in advance of
publication, I wanted to give you a chance to help correct or update the
text and give me any comments to make sure I'm treating the subject fairly
in your mind.  My deadline is approaching, but I still haven't heard from
you or anyone in your organization.  Could you please let me know if you
plan to comment, or if there is anything I can do to make the process more
convenient.  I'm happy to speak to someone on the phone, for instance.

Thanks again for your participation and assistance,

Sincerely,

Christopher Hoenig
