Tom,

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Love,

Mark
