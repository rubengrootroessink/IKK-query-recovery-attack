Jeff, I just wanted to follow up on the military adventure travel group 
information I sent you a few weeks ago.  If you are still interested in going 
with your YPO group please do not hesitate to ask.

Jeff, attached is a link to the web site for Specops.  They are the U.S. 
Special Forces group that does specialized adventure travel that we discussed 
on Sunday.  I went ahead and printed most of the information on the website 
for your convenience and gave it to Sherri to give to you.  I hope this helps 
you out with your trip planning.  If you would like me to help you out with 
this trip please do not hesitate to ask.
