Tom,

Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for the
communication.

Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores without
electricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lack
of electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked around
for a couple hours, covering some ground.

It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and
probably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spont
outdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,
and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of the
night).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the
stars were all out, as the city had gone dark.  Quite an experience.

More later,

Mark
