Thanks for the time yesterday.  I wanted also to tell you about this 
recurring dream I've had (3 times now).  Your buddy Lee Raymond's company 
bought Enron, you both become co-CEO (money on you), and our mgmt team gets 
to apply our way of business to ExxonMobil, and unbelievable wealth and 
shareholder value is created.  Odds?
