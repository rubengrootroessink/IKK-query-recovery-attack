Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building 
tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  
Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I 
don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for 
Wednesday.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Joannie

Joannie,

Just a reminder about the job tour on Wednesday.  I will be in San Diego
until Tuesday night so I wanted to check in today.  I will be happy to come
to Jeff's office to pick him up or we can meet in the lobby. Just give me a
time and I'll set it up.  I will also be available to show him the Hobby
Performing Arts Center if he has time.

-Stan
