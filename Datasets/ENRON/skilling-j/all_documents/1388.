Mr. Compton,

This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt 
on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since 
mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch 
with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.

Regard,
Sherri Sera
