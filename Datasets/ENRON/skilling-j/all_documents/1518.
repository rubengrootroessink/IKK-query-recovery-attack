Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

With click-through rates plunging all over the World Wide Web, conventional 
wisdom says that Internet portals no longer have a legitimate place in 
consumer marketing plans.

An exclusive analysis by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, however, paints an entirely 
different picture.  True...the role of portals has changed, but the change 
has made them even more potent than before.  Instead of mere gateways, 
portals are centers of content and commerce that draw audiences in the same 
way that large-circulation magazines and successful TV networks do.

Major changes are taking place in terms of banner advertising, search engine 
use, per-click pricing, and the way business is done on the Internet.  But 
the truly amazing aspect of all this is that portals are still changing.  
First they were gateways, now they are destinations...what will the next 
phase be?  And what will it mean to you?

To find the answers to those questions, I suggest that you carefully read 
"The Great Portal Payoff" by Horacio D. Rozanski and Gerry Bollman in the 
upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the 
select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send 
complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you 
have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot 
keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...but it would be best if 
you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

subscription, just click on the following link:
