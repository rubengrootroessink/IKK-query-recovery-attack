Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four 
Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a 
check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would 
you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another 
destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  
Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300
Lamar Street) about 7:15.  Just let me know, otherwise I will take a cab.

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS
