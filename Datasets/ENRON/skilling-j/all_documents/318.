Hi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch.  
Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow 
(Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a 
reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let 
me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS

PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do 
you have it down, too?
