Salomon makes a negative call on chips; ENTU (Entrust Technologies) CA*
(Computer Associates) and BMCS* (BMC Software) miss big and oh yes lets not
forget the post-holiday reverberations of ORCL's (Oracle) # 2 man stepping
down - it wasn't pretty in tech. Is it any wonder the Nasdaq was never in
the green and closed down over 125? In listed-land it was Saudi Arabia
threatening to sink oil prices vs. some buoyancy in the financials and drugs
- and the bears won with the Dow Industrials closing down 77. In tech - ENTU
down over 50%, ORCL down almost 9%, AMAT (Applied Materials) AMD (Advanced
Micro Devices) NSM (National Semiconductor) down 10% or more, VTSS (Vitesse
Semiconductor) MU (Micron Technologies) TXN (Texas Instruments) down over
6%, LU* (Lucent Technologies) CSCO (Cisco Systems) SUNW (Sun Microsystems)
GE (General Electric) YHOO (Yahoo) all down over 4%, RHAT (Red Hat Inc) down
7% - a couple of bright spots (but only a couple) AOL (America Online) up
over 2 1/2% and T (AT&T) up over 3%. The oils and the drillers were a drag -
BPA (BP Amoco PLC) and APA (Apache Corp) down 7%, TX (Texaco Inc) CHV
(Chevron Corp) and SLB (Schlumberger Inc) down over 4%, XOM (Exxon Mobile)
down 3%, BHI (Baker Hughes Inc.) down 6% meanwhile IMNX (Immunex Corp) BGEN
(Biogen) LLY (Ely Lilly) all up 4%, AMG (Affliated Mangers Group) up 7%, BMY
(Bristol Myers Squibb) up 2% and the financials - WFC (Wells Fargo) GS
(Goldman Sachs Group) C (Citigroup) all up 1%, MER (Merrill Lynch) MWD (MS
Dean Witter) ONE (Bank One Corp) ALL (Allstate Corp) all up 2%.... In the
CEUT Universe the stories of the day were BMCS* and CA* - both down 40%
after negative pre-announcements - CA* announced first and Paul Rodriguez
attributed the miss to three factors - Europe, mainframe slowness and not
closing two deals; BMCS* followed - the street did not react positively to
their morning call. Karl Motey's space was hit due to the Saloman call -
PMCS* (PMC Sierra Corp) KOPN+ (Kopin) down 8, TLCM* (Telecom Semiconductors)
PSEM* (Pericom Semiconductors) down 9, SSTI* (Silicon Storage) down almost
15... JDSU (JDS Uniphase) down over 9... IMAN (Imanage Inc) down 8%....
PROX* (Proxim) down over 5... VRTS* (Veritas Software) down over 4 1/2,
MUSE* (Micromuse) up over 3 1/2.... SPOT* (Panam Sat) down over 2.... JBL*
(Jabil Circuit) down over 2.... COVD* (Covad) up over 1.... after the close
RDCM+ (Radcom) pre-announced negatively.
