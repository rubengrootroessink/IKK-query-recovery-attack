Nice photo Fred. ?How convenient of Woody to give directions to his fellow 
Betas waiting on the green, inviting their participation in a Beta BooFoo ala 
Drow. ?As for the other two guys in the photo, aren't they Officer Caffey of 
SMU Security and Willis Tate? ?They never could catch Drow while he was an 
undergraduate at SMU.
