Thanks, Joan.  I'll have IT look into it.  You can always send an e-mail to 
the "office of the chairman" e-mail address.  Additionally, Mr. Lay's name in 
the directory is "Kenneth Lay."  SRS

The "Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling" email address does not work.  When one writes 
in ken lay, "Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling" appears, however, there is a delivery 
failure to this address.  You may want to check this out.
