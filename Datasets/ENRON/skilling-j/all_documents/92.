Mark,  

Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was 
wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the 
process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to 
guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation 
area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once 
received from the guides.

Please let us know if you're at all interested.

Thanks, Sherri
