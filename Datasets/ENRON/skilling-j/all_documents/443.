Jeff,

Once again, thank you very much for your advice on gas.

However, while your advise was sound in principal ("threatening a $3.00 upside
against a $0.50 downside, at the $5.00 level"), next time let me know if your
going to be off as much as 40%( we hit a $5.00 upside instead of $3.00).

Thanks for the help.

Bryan
