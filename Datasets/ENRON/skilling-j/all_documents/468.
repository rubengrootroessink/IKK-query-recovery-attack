Jeff, 

Congratulations on your well-deserved move to CEO of Enron.? Incredible 
things have happened there under your leadership and I'm glad to see it 
recognized.? I wish you much success.

Meanwhile, we continue to progress with our DSL/Cable Internet connected 
CD/DVD offering - having signed Harman Kardon to manufacture, Microsoft for 
our A/V codecs and digital rights management, a wide range of audio video 
content providers, and full page ads in the USATODAY as part of our $270 
million Gannett relationship.? We are also up an running with 170 units in 
friends and families homes upgrading remotely.? What remains is us choosing 
the right broadband backbone/conduit relationship.? 

Have a great holiday season and happy new year. 

Regards, 

Eric 

(Sherry thanks for your all your help.)
