Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of 
the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to 
find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back 
in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My 
apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your 
patience.  SRS

Jeff/Sherri 

Unfortunately I jump on a plane Thur at 430pm EDT and don't think that leaves 
enough of a gap to make Jeff's availability. Can we try to reschedule 
conversation?

I have copied my assistant, Tiffany Roach, on this message to help 
coordinate. 

Thanks, 

David
