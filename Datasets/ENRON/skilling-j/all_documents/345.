Jeff,

I emailed you a couple of weeks ago regarding my interest in Harvard Business 
School and I wanted to follow up with you.  I am going to be in Houston on 
December 11, 12 & 13 for business and I was hoping that our schedules meshed 
and I might be able to come by to say hello.

I hope we have an opportunity to meet in December.

Best Regards,

Bruce Rudy

Jeff,

As per Paul Trieschman's suggestion, I am contacting you in reference to 
Harvard Business School.  I am a Manager with ENA in Denver who has come up 
through the Analyst/Associate program and I am planning on returning to 
business school next Fall.  If you had a moment, I would appreciate the 
opportunity to discuss my background with you, as well as pick your brain on 
the experiences you had while at HBS.

Best Regards,

Bruce Rudy
