Thanks, Matthew.  Let me know when I should have Jeff arrive in London in the 
event you or John Sherriff want to set up other customer meetings while he's 
there.  I will have him return to Houston on Friday, 9/28, but he could 
arrive in London as early as Tuesday, 9/25.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS

Sherri - The date is Thursday 27th September in London.  It will be a lunch 
format with around 20 attendees.  We will be away from Enron House at a 
central London location (to be confirmed) between 12.15pm and 2.45pm.

Matthew, Jeff's soundbite is "the transformation of gas and electric 
markets."  Hope this helps.  SRS

Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we 
get one of them fixed.

It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free 
markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference.

Matthew, my apologies for the delayed response.  Jeff is definitely 
interested in chairing the September 2001 meeting.  Please let me know if 
you  have any dates in mind and we'll see how they work on Jeff's schedule.

Subject: UK CEOs

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

Matthew
