Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want 
what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll 
send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS

If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to 
either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
Becky Pham (EB2336b)
or Amelia Alder (3Ac3120).

Thanks.
