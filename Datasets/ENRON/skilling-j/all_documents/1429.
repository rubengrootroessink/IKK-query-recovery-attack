Sam, Jeff said he would be happy to talk with you.  Just look for him in 
LaGrange late Saturday afternoon.  Good luck on the ride!  SRS

Subject: MS150 interview for A/A Encounter

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be 
riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I 
am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping 
that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in 
La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and 
we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.
