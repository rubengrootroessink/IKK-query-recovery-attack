Jim,

I have the list below with the information I have:

Ghatghar  Don't Know
Tata Hydro  Hydro
Koyna   Hydro
Koyna IV  Is a pump storage project, but am not clear on fuel, probably uses 
electric pumps during off peak.  Primary purpose is likely irrigation.
Khaperkheda  Coal
Koradi   Coal
Chandrapur  Coal
Parli   Coal
Uran   Domestic gas, currently in short supply
Trombay  Nuclear
Nasik   Coal
Bhusawal  Coal
BSES   Coal
Dabhol   Naphtha, converts to LNG with Phase II

Additionally, please note that there is no other liquid fuel fired power 
plant in Maharashtra, aside from Dabhol.  The Reliance Patalganga plant is 
still under development and this would be naphtha based when completed, but 
it is not clear that it will go ahead.  There was a scheme to develop liquid 
fuel fired medium sized projects in many states, including a bid for 9 such 
plants in Maharashtra.  None of them are likely to see light of day.

In short, DPC cannot replace any other oil fired plant in Maharashtra with a 
higher heat rate.

Hope this helps.  I will be back in Mumbai next week.  Please let me know if 
additional information is needed.  I am available at 011-91-9821068238 when 
in India.

We are starting the data collection and ratification for the Henwood study in 
earnest, and I am having there representative in India also on Friday.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Can you identify the fuel for each of the plants listed for Maharashtra in 
the Appendices you gave me?
