Hello --

A quick summary of key e-market/exchange progress over the past couple months:

1)  i2 network proposal submitted:  $20 million over a 36-month term -- U.S.,
Bussels, India.

2)  Financial Settlement Matrix launched:  120-day pilot -- EBS, i2, Citibank,
Wells Fargo, S1 Corp. --  EBS has 18% stake -- no significant revenue this 
year.

3)  i2 and IBM sponsoring EBS in MyAircraft.com (aircraft parts exchange) and
iStarExchange (Toyota private exchange):  rough estimate of initial network
business in these exchanges is $3 million annually (grows as exchanges grow) 
--
early discussion stage.

4)  i2 and Nortel sponsoring EBS in e2Open.com (high tech exchange with lots 
of
visibility, IBM is also a key player):  in early discussion stage.

5)  Ariba wishes to pull EBS into the Ariba Commerce Services Network (ACSN):
initial network proposal from EBS will include San Jose and London with Tokyo 
to
follow as soon as available -- rough estimate is $10 million over 36-month 
term
-- Ariba is also open to a proposal on hosting services from EBS.

6)  Lots of other business development in various stages, including Commerce
One, Oracle, Tivoli, BMC, and multiple exchanges and exchange technology
providers.

The good news is that the EBS pitch has been impressive to potential customers
and partners (see attached presentation for a sample).  We are pitching 
network
services successfully (the VBN product is key), but it is clear that the Enron
financial services skills are a major reason that customers are attracted to 
EBS
in this space -- through Mathis Conner and others in the Tech Channels Group,
EBS is gaining considerable skill in the value-added services arena (which is
where a lot of the future revenue resides).

Enron Net Works has been helpful to EBS' efforts in the exchange space.  Also
helpful are other EBS groups, such as those of Kevin Garland, Kevin Howard, 
and
Larry Lawyer.  As we become increasingly more visible in this space, we need 
to
think about how we want to unfold the story publicly.

I hope this update is useful.  Best regards.
