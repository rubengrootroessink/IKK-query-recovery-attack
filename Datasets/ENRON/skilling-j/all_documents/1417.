Diomedes, I have been searching high and low for this information for you, 
and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff 
dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of 
$110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, 
which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you?  
Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you 
designate.  SRS

Hi Jeff,

I was trying to get a copy of the expense report of Swanswalk (the company
we set up to buy the house in Rio) and I discovered that unfortunately my
copy is in the boxes I sent to London from Brazil and they still have not
cleared customs in the U.K. If you recall, I sent you a copy of the report a
few months ago and I was wondering if you kept a copy in your files. If you
did can you please fax me a copy in the U.K at 011-44-2078239871?

Thanks and I hope all is well with you.

Diomedes.
