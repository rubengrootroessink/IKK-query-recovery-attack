Dear Jeffery,

You're under a lot of pressure to perform. You need new ways-fast-to manage 
costs while increasing revenues.

According to a study by Cornell University, the average time an employee 
spends at his/her workspace ranged from 43% to 58%.

Think of the opportunities for productivity increases and real estate savings.
