Light volume, positive day... yawn, yawn... then after the close: the
biggest non-news news of the millennium - Judge Jackson ruled to break-up
Mr. Softee.  MSFT sold off initially (after being up small on the day) but
is trading up over 2 as I write this (5:45PM NY Time).  Gates is defiant and
feels that things will go his way on appeal - he might be right but given
Mr. Bill's penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the
front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if
it were completely out of the realm of possibility.  A more tempered, less
emotional, less personal response might have been abit more comforting for
stockholders - many people feel Mr. Bill's hubris got them into this mess to
begin with - look at INTC and CSCO - they know when to tip their hat at
Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room.  The key is the restrictions which
are supposed to go into effect in 90 days - Gates feels very very very very
confident that they will be thrown out and Mr. Softee will suffer no harm
during the appeal - evidentially many after hours traders share his view.
They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT net strategy - which is
to be announced at the end of June.  In the broader markets - it was a
reversal of yesterday with financials and tech on the rebound (IBM, ORCL,
HWP, SUNW, C, BAC, AXP, LEH, BSC, AMTD...) and utilities and energy falling
to profit taking (XOM, BPA, RD, WMB, PCG, CPL....).  In the CEUT Universe -
it was a mixed bag - ITWO* up over 11, MANU* (which was down over 5) closed
in the green - Catherine Moore spoke inter-day and said the sellers were
wrong..... AMCC* down almost 10, KOPN* down almost 3 1/2, PMCS* down over 2
but SSTI* up over 7.... BRCD* up over 10 1/2, NTAP* & PRCM up over 4...
MUSE* up over 4, VRTS* up over 9.... TMPW up over 3... GMH* down over 8 1/2,
XMSR* up 1/2, PGTV* down over 6 1/2... IMAN+ up almost 1...   In IPO-land
GCBF never came but UbiquiTel (UPCS), a wireless service provider associated
with Sprint PCS,  came at 8 (below original range) and closed down almost 4%
- not great but given these markets.... tomorrow is the PPI # - if shows
soft on inflation then the feeling is the Fed will not raise in June.
