Beek,

Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party 
Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home 
Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but 
so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
