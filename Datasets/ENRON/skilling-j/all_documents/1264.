Dear Suzanne,

I'm sorry for the delay in returning your e-mail.  We're catching up now 
after taking some time off over the holidays.

Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even 
early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in 
late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me 
should you wish to proceed on that basis.

Thank you and regards,
Sherri Sera

Subject: Congratulations/January Meeting


Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on being named Enron's new Chief Executive Officer.  What an
outstanding and well-deserved accomplishment.

Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January
to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested
in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be
willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank
you.

Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint
several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She
shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to
venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments,
the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.  She also told
me that decisions on venture and private equity can often take quite awhile.
I will keep you posted on any further developments that I learn.

Warm regards,

Suzanne
