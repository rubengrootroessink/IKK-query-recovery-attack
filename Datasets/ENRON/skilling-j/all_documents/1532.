Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?
Erica

Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be
possible to schedule during the next quarter?

Thanks,
Joannie
