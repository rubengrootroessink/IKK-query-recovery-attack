Dear YPO Member,

You are invited to participate in a very important YPO survey.  In response 
to Member requests for "smaller, less expensive, shorter events" offered by 
YPO International, we would like you to participate in a brief online survey 
to help us design future programs for YPO Members.

Please take just a few minutes and give us your very important opinions.  You 
may click on

type it in, or copy and paste this address to your web browser.  This will 
take you directly to the survey, and you will be guided quickly through the 
process.  All responses are completely confidential.  Please complete the 
survey by Tuesday, December 19, 2000.

Thank you for your time and responses to assist us in designing event 
products to meet your needs.  The survey results will be made public early 
next year.  However, if you would like a personal copy of the results, please 
contact YPO International at dcook@ypo.org.

Kind regards,

Herb Conley (Hawaii Chapter)
Senior Vice President- Events
