Jan Mann, Executive Recruiter, Mayor's Office. Met with her on Friday, 1/5. 
She said she had tapped into the following for potential candidates:
1. Ad placed in Fire Chief Magazine and on Firechief.com web page.
2. Announcement sent to all HFD employees.
3. Utilized Municipal Yellow pages (a who's who in the leading city and 
county governments and local authorities), targeting fire department 
personnel in the top 18 cities (based on population).

As a result of her efforts, 18 resumes have been received and were forwarded 
to me. However, when I accessed the firechief.com web page this weekend I 
could not find the advertisement (I have asked her to check on this ASAP). 
Moreover, surfing various web pages/sites related to fire 
departments/associations, I was very impressed by the International Fire 
Chiefs web page (especially compared to the Fire Chief web page) and 
suggested to Jan as well as Dennis Thompson (see below) that we try to 
advertise there as well.

As a result of my "surfing the net", I have compiled a list of decorated fire 
chiefs as well as recognized fire chief leaders on various fire related 
boards and committees. While these individuals may not fit into the top 18 
cities in terms of population, I do not believe we should narrow our search 
to this criteria. I believe what we are looking for here is an outstanding 
leader with a track record of implementing change and cooperation within the 
different divisions in the fire department. 

Dennis Thompson, Special Projects Director, Public Safety & Drug Policy. I 
met with him today at 11am. He expects to have an answer on the legal issue 
(whether I would be excluded from public access) sometime today and the list 
of HFD and consultant contacts possibly today but most likely tomorrow. 

Of special interest from our discussions are the following:

1. Internal vs. external issue 
- only one Fire Chief was from outside (Swartout) and it was a disaster (he 
lasted 3 1/2 months)
- Acting Fire Chief, Connealy, really wants the job

2. Current state of the fire department
- fire prevention (considered critical by TriData) wasn't given the attention 
needed by Tyra
- personnel fractioned - union partly to blame
- communication broken down
- low moral
- department underfunded

Please let me know if I am overlooking anything here.
