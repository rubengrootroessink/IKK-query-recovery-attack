Jeff,

Unfortunately, Jeff doesn't have any information on Rick Barsky.  Would you 
like for me to try and get information from anyone else?

Thanks,
Joannie

Subject: Membership question


Through YPO International, we got a membership inquiry from Rick Barsky,
CEO of Agennix(don't know what company does).  He apparently used to work
at Enron.  Bio says he was involved in start up of Enron Renewable Energy
Corp. and Enron Solar.  Any input you can give us on this guy?
