Dear Mr. Brannen,

Jeff has left for the day, so has not yet seen your note.  However, I wanted 
to let you know that the timing may not work on February 15.  He is attending 
a board meeting that morning, which is followed by a luncheon.  There is not 
much daylight in the afternoon, either, but I'll check with him first thing 
Monday morning to see if there is anything we can do to free up a few minutes.

Have a nice weekend.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Subject: Meeting in Houston


Hi Jeff,

Update:  I am a good friend of John Millers in Atlanta. We actually met at
his wedding.

I am coming to Houston next week and have a 1:30 appt on the 15th.  with
Bill Donovan to demonstrate what we do...long story but he is excited to see
what we do.

I was thinking maybe we could grab an early lunch before the meeting.

Let me know.

Bill
