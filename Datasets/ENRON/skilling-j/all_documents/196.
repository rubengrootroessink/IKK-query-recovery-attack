Dear Mr.Skilling

I joined Enron Energy Services several years ago as General Manager of Major 
Accounts-Mid Atlantic region. I have had the pleasure to meet you several 
times, particularly at several republican fund raising breakfast's. I believe 
Enron is a great company and destined for great things in the future.
 
As of 6/30, it will be the last day of my employment with EES. I wanted to 
say it was a pleasure working for you and I enjoyed the challenges we faced 
and the accomplishments we have made at EES over the last couple of years. I 
hope in the future we can visit if your in the Philadelphia area or if I can 
be of assistance in anyway please don't hesitate to call.

Best Regards, Frank LeMaster
