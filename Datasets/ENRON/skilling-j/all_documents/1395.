Here's some good riding for the weekend.  I've heard on the street that the

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of "9" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!
