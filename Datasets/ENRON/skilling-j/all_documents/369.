Dear Jeff,
Attached please find the resume of my nephew  Eduardo. He is hoping to have a 
chance for an internship at Enron next summer  2001. If you would be so kind, 
please forward this resume to the appropriate  person in your company. I 
would appreciate it very much. 
I'll see you Saturday at the YPO Christmas  Party.
Thanks,
Armando
