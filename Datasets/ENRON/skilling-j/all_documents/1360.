Subject: RE quote eCompany


Mr. Skilling,

I was compelled to contact you by the following information:
While reading eCompany Magazine March Issue, I came across the following
quote from Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron.

"Keeping the system up. You dread the chance the system will crash. We had
an air conditioning problem last April or May, and went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said "Gas
trading stops because Enron online is down.""

Netbotz offers early warning to just that type of failure and more.

Mr. Skilling who would I contact at Enron to make them aware of a product
with a sub $1000. price tag to prevent those issues in the future?
