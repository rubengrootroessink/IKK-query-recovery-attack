Jeff -

Thanks for spending some time with us at our office.

On the high yield side, I have never seen my boss so quiet and uncomfortable
at a company meeting.
Rumor is he left early to sell the telecom stocks he held in his own
account.

On the equity side, our utility fund manager is still getting up to speed.
Enron was the last stock I recommended at Loomis Sayles in 1998, and I have
consistantly advocated a
major overweight here at Eaton, but she has been slow to buy and quick to
sell.  I understand she is buying again.

In any event, there is no doubt you made a deep impression on all of the
Eaton participants.

Best regards, Dave
