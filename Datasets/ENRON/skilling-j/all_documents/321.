It was great catching up with you in Barcelona and wonderful to hear that
you will be coming to South Africa on vacation. When you are in J'Burg,
plan on staying with us and if you can fit it in, try to spend a couple of
days up at our game park. Our place is about 2 1/2 hours north of
Johannesburg, on about 120,000 acres, malaria free with the big 5 as well
as a great variety of other game. It would be great to sit together on the
deck of our lodge with a gin and tonic at catch up while watching elephant
in our front yard. If you are time constrained, we can always charter up to
Welgevonden if you don't have an Enron plane in the vicinity.

Here are some contact details
   Home phone - 27-11 447-8514

As soon as your plans firm up, give me a ring to see how we can get
together. We also know this part of the world quite well so we'd be
delighted to help plan your trip. Chovine and I will look forward to seeing
you.

Best regards

Schof
