Joe, because there seems to be some question whether EECC ever pleases its 
Enron customers, I wanted to pass on to you the compliments of ENA ( below) 
on the Doyle Georgia Power Project, which is nearing completion.  Just FYI.

John:

I just got a call from Bob Virgo commending the terrific job being being done 
by the Doyle team.  Bob said that in each and every case,  Paul and his team 
have done a great job meeting the many challenges imposed by the project and 
that ENA is very appreciative of their fine work.  -  Just wanted you to know.

Thanks,
John
