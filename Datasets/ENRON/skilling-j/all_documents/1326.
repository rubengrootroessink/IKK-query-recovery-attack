Sherri, here's the info you need.  I would recommend that they both join the 
cycling club at $35 each, and then we will pay for their registrations.  Jeff 
Skilling's has already been paid for even though he hasn't paid his dues for 
2001.  Effectively,  the bike club pays the registrations through the 
membership fees, and his daughter would be eligible to join with him, so if 
you could forward me a check for $70, and get his/her membership and her 
MS150 form back to me, I'll take care of everything.  (We already have Jeff's 
MS150 registration done, as I said.)

On the fundraising:  Please mention to Jeff that BP, who is the main sponsor 
of this year's tour, has issued a challenge to Enron.  They are seriously out 
to beat us out of first place and they claim that they already have 400 
riders.  We, of course, don't want that to happen, although we are pleased 
with the jump-start we have given to the Houston corporate world in relation 
to this ride.  I'm encouraging our current team members to raise their 
fundraising as much as possible, and especially our top people.  Do you think 
we could get Jeff to $100,000 this year?  Last year he came in at $65,000.  
Wendy Gramm is not riding this year because Phil Gramm has a high school 
reunion the same night, so could Jeff ask Wendy to raise money anyway and 
throw it our way, or she could just raise the money and give herself the 
credit even though she's not riding?  Do you have any ideas on that?  Do you 
want me to contact her to discuss or would it be better for you or Rebecca to 
do that?  



MS150 - April 21-22

Amelia, would you please e-mail me the Enron team sign up for for MS150?  
Jeff's daughter would like to ride with the Enron team.  Let me know what I 
owe you for that, and I'll send you a check when she fills out the 
registration form.  Thanks, SRS
