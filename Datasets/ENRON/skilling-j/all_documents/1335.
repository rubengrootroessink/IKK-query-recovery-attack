Greg, I had a message to call Joe Dial yesterday.  I haven't called him back 
yet.  Should I wait to hear from you?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

FYI.

We are meeting with Joseph Dial next Tuesday, a former CFTC commissioner and 
friend of the Wendy Graham.  He had sent you a letter on March 1 about an 
options and futures exchange he was building called eWorldTradeX, Inc.  I 
don't know what he wants, but we are following up on it and we will let you 
know about it, if necessary.

Thanks.

GP

Mr. Skilling is traveling next Tuesday, so he won't be participating in the 
meeting with Mr. Dial.  I've confirmed Bibi and Zipper.
