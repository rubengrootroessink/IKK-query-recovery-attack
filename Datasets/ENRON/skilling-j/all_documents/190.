Where mountains touch Big Sky
And clear waters amplify
A transient souls request
Does Montana meet the test? ? ? YUP!

In Southwest Montana snow capped peaks feed clear mountain lakes and streams. 
As these high mountain water sources merge in the lower valleys they foster 
more stunning scenery and create the Madison River ecosystem.

This magnificent watershed nurtures fish and wildlife habitat of unequaled 
splendor.

You are invited to join us at the 2000 YPO Montana Experience and indulge the 
outdoor adventure of your choice. Horseback rides into the Spanish Peaks, fly 
fishing on the Madison, white water float trips via the Bear Trap
Express and upland bird hunting at the Diamond Wing Hunting Reserve are but a 
few of the options available. Couple all this with real Montana hospitality 
reflective of a cultural heritage rooted firmly in the traditions of the Old 
West.

Dates for the YPO Montana Experience are October 5th-8th, 2000. For more 
information and registration check out the Montana Chapter website:
