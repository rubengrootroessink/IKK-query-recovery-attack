>Subject: Citizen Action If Gore Does Not  Concede
time to wake up  
>
>
>Here with is some practical advice on action that  every citizen can take
>in the event that the Florida recount confirms the  election of George
>Bush, but Al Gore fails to concede.
>
>We  all know what is going on in Florida, and that the election hinges on
>the  outcome. I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will
>have  to do if what I think is going to happen actually does.
>
>The  recount, which will be finished by 5 p.m. Thursday, will likely show
>Bush  to be the winner once again, with only a few thousand overseas
>ballots to  be counted. Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush, a
>minimum of  60% and probably closer to 75%. If the count goes our way, we
>have won  this
>election.
>
>This is when something critical happens.  Either Gore bows out gracefully
>or he doesn't, and I can almost guarantee  he won't. These are people
>wedded to power who will only go down kicking  and screaming. They will
>use every legal maneuver in the book to steal  the election. (In 1960,
>when Richard Nixon had
>every right and  reason to challenge the election results he didn't for
>the sake of the  country. Expect no such noble behavior this time.)
>
>What will they  try? One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the
>Florida results  on a flimsy premise. They are already floating this as a
>trial balloon in  the form of the allegedly "confusing" ballots in Palm
>Beach County. I  have seen the ballots - they are not confusing in  the
>least.
>
>Indeed, they are identical in form to the  punch-card ballots used in
>Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, in this  very election. What is more,
>it is just as likely that Palm Beach County  voters who wanted to vote
>for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader. All  parties approved the form of
>ballot before the election. The  form-of-ballot issue is a mere pretext
>for an effort a judicial  invalidation of the Florida election.
>
>While I hope this scenario  doesn't come to pass, I fear that it will,
>and it will only have  disastrous results for the country. The election
>fight could drag on for  months and actually be decided by a court! If
>this comes to pass the  vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots
>will have been  betrayed.
>
>Personally, I am not going to stand for this, and I  hope you won't
>either. The good news is that we are not without  voice.
>
>HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE: if the vote count affirms  Bush's election, we
>allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the  Gore camp. If they
>have not graciously conceded after a few hours, we  must bombard the news
>media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with  phone calls of
>outrage that demand Gore's concession. I mean literally  millions of
>phone calls. We must jam their phone banks with calls. There  are
>millions of us so it shouldn't be too difficult. (While you're at  it,
>send e-mails to your? local newspapers as  well.)
>
>If it becomes widely reported - and it will - that there  is a
>groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the  country,
>it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure. He  will
>have to relent.
>
>Here are some places to  start:

>NEWS FLASH - World  Series Outcome On Hold !!!!!! 
?
NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are  going
to? court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5  ofthe
World Series.? The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the  Mets
held a press conference earlier today.? They were joined by members  of
the Major League Players Union.? "We meant to hit those pitches from  the
Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach.? "We were confused by  the
irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been  denied
our right to hit."
?
One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets  batters
had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve  balls.? It
was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve  balls, though
a much higher percentage were not confused by the  pitches.? Reporters at
the press conference pointed out that the Mets  had extensively reviewed
film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World  Series and had infact faced
the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the  year.? "The fact remains
that some of the pitches confused us and denied  us of our right to hit,"
said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is  not over yet and the
Yankees are celebrating prematurely."
?
Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World  Series
games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of  each
game.? "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in  fact,
balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the  World
series," the commissioner said.
?
Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on  on-base
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardlessof  the
final scores of the games.? "It's clear that we were slightly  on-base
more often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman.? "The World  Series
crown is rightly ours."? The manager of the Mets has remained in  relative
seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.? He has  stated
that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without  
rush to judgment."
