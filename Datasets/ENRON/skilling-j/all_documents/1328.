Jeff,

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
Germans!

Thanks again,

Joe
