CONFIDENTIAL


=09


Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20
Trakya project, and report as necessary.
