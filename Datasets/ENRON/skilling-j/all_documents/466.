What wonderful news for you, Jeff, and it sounds as though you will now have 
two plates full.  As a Sr. Admin, may I offer any assistance to you or your 
Exec Assistant, no matter how small, to help you in any way.  I have been in 
awe of Enron since day one for me, and I continue to revel in its successes.  
I'm proud to be here, and I thank both you and Ken (an Joe) for building this 
company on such an exciting foundation.  My very best wishes for a happy 
holiday season.
Sincerely,
Regina Karsolich
