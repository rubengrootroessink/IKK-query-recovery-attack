Dear Jeff,

     I want to say thank you so much for speaking at our 2001 Deer Valley
Conference.  I know how difficult making, and then keeping, commitments
like this can be.  You are a great great friend to have taken the time to
help us out.  Hopefully it was helpful to you as well.
     I thought this year's conference was the best ever and the feedback we
have already received supports that.  We had a fascinating mix of guests
and panels and thanks to you it was a smash hit.
     Deer Valley is our premier client event and you are a premier client.
Thank you for being generous with your time.  On behalf of all my partners,
we appreciate your friendship.

With kind personal regards,




Sincerely,

Jimmy
