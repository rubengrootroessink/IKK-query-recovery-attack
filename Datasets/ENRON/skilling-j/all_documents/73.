Hello --

The IBM meeting on Monday at 12:30pm in Houston (49C1) is an informal working 
session meeting for the EBS/IBM ASP team rather than a major checkpoint 
meeting.  Therefore, you definitely do not need to attend.  However, you are 
certainly welcome to drop by at any time.  A few morale words about the 
importance of the effort and the size of the joint opportunity with IBM in 
the ASP space are always welcome if you get a chance to come by.

Jeff:  I got a call from Perminder Bindra on Saturday.  He says that the IBM 
team assigned to EBS is extremely excited.  His concern is that there are 
other ASP efforts with other companies going on in IBM, and he fears that the 
"normal" IBM noise level around these efforts could slow us down (our goal is 
an agreement this quarter).  So if you can stress our need for speed in your 
call with Sam P. tomorrow, that would be helpful.  I am hoping that IBM will 
treat EBS as the top ASP-related partnership that they develop.  Thanks for 
your help.  

  Best regards.

-- Rex
