Jeff,

I am forwarding an analysis put together by Sandeep Kohli and reviewed by 
Vince and me.  The results in the attached word document show that Dabhol 
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributed 
generation which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does not 
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy 
costs.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

Regards,

Stinson

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.
