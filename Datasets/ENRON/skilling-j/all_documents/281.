Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to get in touch with you to see about setting 
up some lunches for the two of you.  He's traveling quite a bit again in 
October, but I'll give you the dates he's available and you tell me which of 
those days you can do it:

Friday, October 13
Monday, October 16
Thursday, October 19
Thursday, October 26
Wednesday, November 1
Monday, November 6
Friday, November 10
Monday, November 13
Tuesday, November 14.

I'll hold all of these dates for you until I hear back from you.  Would you 
be able to go at 12:00 noon?  SRS
