Ms. Robinson, 

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you 
via e-mail.  He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter 
Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be 
willing to provide us with your phone number?

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your 
future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to the President & CEO
