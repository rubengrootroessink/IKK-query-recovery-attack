Rachael, well, I was wrong again.  Jeff said he is not interested in doing 
the morning broadcast with Sam Malone; no reason given, so I didn't ask.  
Sorry!  SRS

Jeff,

Sam Malone would love for you to join him live at the Morning Show broadcast 
from the Enron Building on April 7.  The optimal time to speak with Sam is 
between 7 and 8 am, but not at the top or bottom of the hour .  He wants the 
opportunity to banter with you on air about why Enron is the best place to 
work, Enron Field and what you have been doing lately.   It will be very 
informal, and depending on your schedule, he welcomes you to stay as long as 
you can.

Please let me know when you are available.   

Rachael
