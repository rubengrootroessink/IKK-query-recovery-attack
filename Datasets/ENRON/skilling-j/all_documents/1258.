Subject: Resume


As you and Sam Palmisano discussed, here's a copy of my resume for your use
with your executive team. Can't tell you how excited I am at the
opportunity to work with you and your whole team to really exploit the
business relationship between Enron and IBM. I'll be scheduling time to
meet all of you as soon as possible.

Happy holidays.
