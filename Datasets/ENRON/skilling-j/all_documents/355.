Ken & Jeff,

Each year I attend the Enron Management Conference the more I realize that 
the daily leadership and vision that the Office of the Chairman provides is 
what allows us to meet and exceed our goals. That leadership and vision in 
turn empowers every employee to do their job and that empowerment translates 
into continued success. That is what make Enron so unique in the global 
marketplace. Thank you for making this such a great company to work for. 

Doug
