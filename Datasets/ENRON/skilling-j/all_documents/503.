Dear Jeff---
    Dad just passed the wonderful news on to all of us.  Congratulations on
your appointment to the position of CEO!!  We are so proud and all know how
hard you've worked for this.
    Will keep this brief as I know you're busy---but just couldn't let this
moment pass without a note.  I know we'll all be talking more.



Tom
