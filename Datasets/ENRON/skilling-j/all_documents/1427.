$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor 
guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you.  
Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
