Hi Jeff,

First, thank you so much for your hospitality the other evening. And
good company.

I emailed Jane and she will get the message Monday morning. I put you on
the message as well so now you have her address.  When I see her I will
fill her in on details and mention your willingness to be an active
parent when Kristen comes here.

I will also email Brenda Bouchard at the Harvard Club. If you are still
interested.


So I checked out enron. You didn't say you were the *largest* energy
trading company!  Or even say it was a large energy company.   Just gas
or oil too?  Does the name Charles Lawrence mean anything to you?  Wall
Street. Oil specialty. Checking out your history skills.

Let me know if there is anything more I can do at BU,  and let us know
when you are coming to Boston again.  Maria and Cheryl are very wired
into the Hill scene. Maria at the Union Club and Governor's office and
Chery everywhere in Boston. And Jane (who you will meet) in the Bahamas.

Regards,

Kay
