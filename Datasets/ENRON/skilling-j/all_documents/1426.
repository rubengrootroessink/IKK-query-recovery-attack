Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you 
- I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their 
executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick 
turnaround.  SRS

taxes and I just finished that little exercise!!!  Loretta

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
