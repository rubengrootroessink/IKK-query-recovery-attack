Sanjay, Jeff asked me to write you to introduce you to Gerald Chan, the 
brother of Ronnie Chan (ENE director).  Gerald has been investing in capital 
ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running 
into companies in which Enron is investing or is interested in investing, and 
Jeff met with him today to discuss this.  Jeff suggested that Gerald contact 
you to discuss further.  I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers, 
address and e-mail address.  You should expect to hear from him shortly.

For your information, below is the pertinent information on Gerald:
