Kevin,

Many thanks for agreeing to speak at our YPO session on April 24, 2001, in
Houston.  The meeting will be held at Enron Broadband Services' network
equipment staging building, which is close to downtown.  We anticipate
attendance of about 100 people.

Breakfast will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the program will run from 8:15 a.m.
to 10:15 a.m.  The subject is "New Trends in Technology and Venture
Capital."  You will be on a panel discussion with two other venture
capitalists.  I expect the tone will be highly informal, but I will
schedule a conference call (probably in early March) to provide more
details and specific topics of interest.

Again, Kevin, thank you.  I look forward to seeing you in April.

Jeff
