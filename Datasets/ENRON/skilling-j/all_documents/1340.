Dear Leslie,

Jeff is traveling and won't be back in the office until Thursday, March 29.  
I will make sure that he sees your note immediately upon his return, but I 
feel quite certain that his answer will remain the same.

Subject: Your note



Dear Jeff:
?
Thanks so much for your kind note regarding the  Symphony Ball. I absolutely 
understand your situation. As busy as I am, I can't  even begin to imagine 
all that is on your dance card!
?
I would love the chance to visit with you about this and see  if there is any 
way that I could persuade you to reconsider being the Corporate  Chair. I am 
certain that it would require only a very minimum amount of your  time. I 
have?? 
a well thought out plan for the execution of this event and  honestly feel 
that you would be very happy with the results. I hope that you  will not 
think me too much of a nuisance and will not hold it against me for  trying. 
?
Many thanks,
?
Leslie
