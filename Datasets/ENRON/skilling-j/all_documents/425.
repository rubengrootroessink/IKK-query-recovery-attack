Brothers,
Woody and I were in the same foursome at our recent golf outing.  Few
people know the manner in which Woody finished out our round.  I don't
think he was aware that I had a camera a caught the moment on film as he
approached the folks waiting for us at the clubhouse.
The photo is attached for your examination.
