Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.


Edward Ondarza
