Amy,
I just wanted to thank you again for all of ENRON's support  with our 
workshop on "Hidden Treasures - A Lost Generation". It was a tremendous  
success with a capital "S".
If there is anything that I can do for you or ENRON in the  future, please do 
not hesitate to ask.
Best wishes, 
Walt Balleza
P.S.
I was elected?Vice-President of Broadcast to the NAHJ by  79% of the vote.
