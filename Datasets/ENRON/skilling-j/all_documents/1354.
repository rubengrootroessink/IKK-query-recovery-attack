Dear Jeff:

I would like to invite you to honor us as the keynote speaker for the Tenth 
Annual Better Business Bureau Awards for Excellence.  This prestigious awards 
program is currently sponsored by the Better Business Bureau Education 
Foundation, the Houston Chronicle, and the University of Houston Bauer 
College of Business.  Proceeds from the event will provide scholarships for 
outstanding students involved in the BBB Education Foundation's Junior Sleuth 
program.  In addition, support generated from the program will assist the 
advancement of Silver Sleuths, a senior protection program initiated by the 
Better Business Bureau to help senior citizens recognize and prevent consumer 
fraud in the Houston market place.  Participants will be presented awards in 
front of some of Houston's most prominent companies and winners will be 
profiled in a special section of the Houston Chronicle.  Incidentally, Jack 
Sweeney, Publisher of the Houston Chronicle, will serve as honorary chair for 
the event.

The date and location for this year's event has not been set, however, the 
program will take place in early October and will be held during lunchtime.  
Featured keynote speakers have included Frank Carney of Papa John's, Greg 
Brenneman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Continental Airlines, 
Frank Maguire, former executive of The ABC Network, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
Federal Express, and American Airlines, M. Douglas Ivester, CEO of the 
Coca-Cola Company, Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus & Co., and Richard 
Teerlink, President and CEO of Harley Davidson, Inc.  Enron has definitely 
proven itself to be an asset to the Houston community as a leader and I feel 
your involvement in our event will only make it more apparent.  I sincerely 
thank you for your consideration on this matter and I look forward to hearing 
from you.  You can reach me at 713-977-4777, ext. 126.
