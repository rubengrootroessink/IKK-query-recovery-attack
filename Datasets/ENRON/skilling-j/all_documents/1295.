Gerald,

Thanks for your reply on the action plan. Regarding your concern of timing, 
we expect Mtg 1 to be in early/mid Febr, Mtg 2 - mid/late Febr, Mtg 3 - late 
Febr, and Mtg 4 - early March. Our biggest hurdle will likely be scheduling 
of interviews with the 10 candidates over a period of 1-2 days - if we are 
successful here we should have no trouble meeting the proposed time 
schedule... What do you think?

Lisa

Lisa, action plan looks good; only concern is over what time frame will this 
take place. Based on my conversation with Jeff, he wanted to have finalist to 
Mayor Brown towards the end of February or early March. That seems somewhat 
aggressive based on action plan.

Gerald
