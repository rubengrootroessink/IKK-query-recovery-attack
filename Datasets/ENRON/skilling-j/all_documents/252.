It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks 
just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!

I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe 
had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' 
house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football 
game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be 
able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night 
of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate 
aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.

That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, 
if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really 
appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to 
the football game Saturday.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Sherri,

I just wanted to make sure that Elvis' invitation was received and all
the other info re: homecoming weekend?

See if you recognize anyone in the attached picture.
