Please review the attached document of pre-interview questions I have drafted 
and let me know what you think. I'd like to send this out first thing Monday 
morning to give the candidates a week to respond (interviews will take place 
on Tuesday, March 6 from 8am to 2pm.)  Following each question you will find 
my reason (in bold and italics) for asking that specific question - it has 
been included in the attached document only for your information.

We are almost there!

Thanks,
Lisa
