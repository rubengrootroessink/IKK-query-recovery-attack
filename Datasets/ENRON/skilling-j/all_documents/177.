The attached draft memo announcing the new stock option plan has been 
prepared and approved by HR and Legal.  We would like to send this by email

available for employees in outlying areas the same day.  In order to 
distribute this on Wednesday, we'd like your approval or comments by 10 a.m. 
Monday, June 26.

Thank you.
Karen
