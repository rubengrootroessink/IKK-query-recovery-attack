Got the list and will begin contacting/meeting with recommended individuals 
immediately.

Summary on the Legal opinion is essentially the following:
 
As long as no public funds are utilized to provide support to the search 
committee and/or its efforts, information obtained/compiled by the committee 
is not considered public information. However, any documented information 
that I or the committee exchange with the City is considered public 
information. The City may provide support to the committee only to facilitate 
the committee's contact with the persons or groups that will provide input. 

City has agreed with recommendation of placement of Advertisement with the 
International Association of Fire Chiefs and it is now due to appear in the 
Classified section of the next issue (Feb. 1 distribution and web posting) of 
International Fire Chiefs' "On Scene" magazine.

City was very pleased with efforts utilized to compile potential candidate 
list (City does not have this list but Ted Bland & Exec Recruiters do.) As a 
matter of fact, TriData's Fire Chief recommendation was already included on 
the list.
