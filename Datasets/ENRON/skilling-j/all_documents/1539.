Hi  Jeff,
?
I am following up on  a confidential manuscript I sent you a few days ago o=
f=20
"Digital Storm  - Fresh business strategies from the Electronic Marketplace=
".=20
 Is is a book about B2B E-Commerce and E-Markets after the hype. It will be=
 =20
distributed by Wiley this summer as an A+ title (lead category) and Hasso =
=20
Plattner, CEO of SAP wrote the preface.
?
Enron is  featured as the most successful marketplace to date with a bright=
 =20
future.
?
I was wondering,  whether you would like to include a testimonial for the=
=20
book.  It would certainly also be good marketing for Enron's entry into new=
 =20
marketplaces. For your convenience I include a potential  quote:
?
Running  the world=01,s largest electronic marketplace, we embrace the=20
opportunities and  challenges of B2B E-Commerce. In =01+Digital Storm=01, P=
hilipp=20
Gerbert and his  colleagues give a powerful analysis of what has been learn=
t=20
and invaluable  insights for future strategies in this area.=20
(you can of course  write what you want; more ideas are in the attachment,=
=20
which also contains  additional information).
?
I apologize that  this is a bit urgent - the deadline is Friday this week =
=20
May 18th).=20
?
I very much hope  that you enjoy the manuscript. Perhaps you would?be=20
interested to further  discuss the ideas.=20
?
Best regards, Phil  Gerbert
