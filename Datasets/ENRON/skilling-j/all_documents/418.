I think we'll probably keep it at just Paul and me.  I'll let you know if
that changes. Regards/Neil.

Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else
be accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Dear Neil,

Sorry you two missed each other last night.  How would 10:30 a.m. on
Wednesday, December 13 work for you and Paul?  I have pencilled it on
Jeff's calendar at that time.  I'll hold it until I hear otherwise.  Thank
you.

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity
to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon;
Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.
If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Neil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house
this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.
In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll
see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.
