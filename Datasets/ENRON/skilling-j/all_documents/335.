Dear Mr. Skilling:

On behalf of the Musser -Schoemaker Leadership Lecture Series, I would like
to thank you for speaking at Wharton.  We appreciate you taking time out of
your busy schedule to share some of your knowledge with us.  I have written
an article for the Wharton Journal covering your lecture.  I thought you
might want to take a look at it.  I have attached it as an MS Paint file.

Sincerely,

Bryan Gitomer
Wharton '03
