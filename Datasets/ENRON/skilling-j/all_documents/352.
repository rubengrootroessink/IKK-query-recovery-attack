Dear Rocky,
Sorry that I missed the get together at SMU last month, but from the
looks of the photos I've seen, a good time was had by all. Hope this
finds you healthy and doing well. My wife and I had dinner last night
with Tom and Betsy McSoley, and your name came up in conversation while
talking about the reunion. I wanted to touch base with you with a
possible business start up idea that may fit into the types of online
services you offer with Enron. We are currently developing an online
licensing agency for the illustration and photographic markets, and I
would like to share the idea and our business plan with you to see if
there is any interest in what promises to be a growing marketplace.
While some companies are currently involved in the photographic end of
this business environment (GettyImages, Corbis), we feel we have a
competitive advantage in that our management team consists of some of
the top illustrators in the field as well as two of the best
intellectual attorneys in the country. We currently have 250 artists and
their collective body of work signed up, and are now in the capital
raising stage, with a launch date of June 2001. I'd love the opportunity
to talk with you further if you think this might be of interest to you.
When time permits, please give me a call at 317 253 3141 and I'd be
happy to share more with you at that time. Thanks for giving this your
consideration Rocky, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kai
Dave Lesh
