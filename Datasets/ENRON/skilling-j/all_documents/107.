Dear Richard,

I am delighted that you will be joining us in Capri in September.  I am 
confident that you will enjoy the discussions, and I certainly look forward 
to hearing your perspectives.

Within the next few weeks, you will receive the formal invitation along with 
more detailed information regarding the agenda, attendees and 
accommodations.  Should you have any questions or need additional information 
in the meantime, please do not hesitate to call me or my assistant, Sherri 
Sera, at 713.853.5984.

Regards,
Jeff Skilling
