David,

Jeff Skilling, president of Enron, recently asked that I recommend a 
visionary venture capitalists to speak at an upcoming YPO meeting that he is 
hosting.  I recommended that Mr. Skilling contact you as a possible speaker.  
He will likely be calling you in the near future to make this request.  I 
know that you are busy, but would appreciate your consideration in this 
matter.

I hope all is well.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland 
Enron Broadband Ventures
