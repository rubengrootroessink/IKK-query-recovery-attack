Dear Jeff:

I think the meeting went well. You do realize I had to get a lot of ground
work done. Dave is a smart man and he was very positive. He indicated to us
after you left, he will like to see us work with you to get a few deals
moving, realizing the culture of ATT.He will go out of the way to help you
and me accomplish what we think is best for the entire industry.

You may want to send him a thank you note, -  draft enclosed. Feel free to
edit it and add your style. Look forward to working with you. There are so
many thoughts in my mind which one day I will like to download on you -
perhaps over dinner. Please check with Ken how to work out the arrangements
with Adventis on the ATT relationship building , Sourcing and the Japan
related opportunities.

Talk to you soon.

Regards,

Partha
