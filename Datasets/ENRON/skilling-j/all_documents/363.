Dear Jeffrey
Airfreight to Houston airport will cost R 2 744.00.  This cost is for the 
service of delivery to the airport and excludes US customs  and duty. South 
Africa is on the?US list of  developing countries and therefore you might pay 
little or no duty if you tell  US customs that the goods are from South 
Africa?and that they are for  personal use. If you wish to pay by credit card
we will need the last 3 digits at the back of the  same credit card that you 
used to pay for your goods.
Regards
Hilary
