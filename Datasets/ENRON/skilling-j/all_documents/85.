Thank you for the information, Brian.  I'll make sure Jeff sees this.  

For your information, should a need arise for you to give Jeff completely 
confidential information, his voicemail is the only secure means to do so (I 
do not have his password).  His extension is 3-6894.  Otherwise, all mail 
(e-mail included) is opened by me.

Again, thank you for your quick response for information.  SRS

Jeff:

 His name is Richard Heidecker, who was sending e-mails to Joe.  Mr. 
Heidecker claimed that he was fired from Enron because of an alleged 
disability.  Our investigation determined that there was no merit to his 
allegation.  However, Mr. Heidecker continued to attempt communications with 
Joe.  I felt that it was prudent  to alert OOC by the message below not to 
engage in unnecessary communications with potential litigants.  I have not 
heard anything from Mr. Heidecker in several weeks.  Please let me know if I 
can be of further assistance.

Brian

Brian, Jeff would like to know who the individual was that was communicating 
with the OOC.  He doesn't recall this situation - please advise.  Thanks,

Subject: Employee Communications with OOC

Ken/Jeff/Joe:

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Brian
