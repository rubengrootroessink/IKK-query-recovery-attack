Jeff, I don't know if you have heard, but WA won the state basketball 
tournement last weekend.? I have ordered the Beacon News for last Sunday and 
would be happy to make copies and send to you.? Kerkman is still the head 
coach in his 24th year.? The point guard on the team is John Fowler.? John's 
dad is Herman Fowler who played in 71.

Hope all is going great for you.? I know the opening of Enron Field is 
keeping you busy as well as running Enron. 

I need to come to Houston soon.? Would there be a time I could run by and say 
hi or buy you a sandwich for lunch? 

Hope to hear from you. 

Mike Buttrey
