Maureen:

Ginger asked me to forward this summary to you, and that Steve asked you to=
 send it to others.  Please note that the attached summary is just the firs=
t in several to come today, and I will send them to you as we finish them. =
 However, the PJM one is probably the most important one, so it's a good on=
e to get out early.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah

PJM RTO Order=09


Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, =
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with t=
he group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing c=
onfiguration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and =
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just =
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will =
keep you updated.

Sarah
