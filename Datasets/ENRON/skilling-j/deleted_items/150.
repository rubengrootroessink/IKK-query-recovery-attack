Sirs,

A numerous times that it was mentioned that you have an open door policy, 
and I am taking the opportunity to write this memo to inform you of issues 
that I felt were not handled in the manner of the Enron's policies.

 In April of this year, there was a job posting for a position with Global
Markets for a Director of Transportation.  A business associate here at Enron
informed me that there was a position and it would fit my husband 's (Bob)
qualification and years of experience.  This business associate knew of my husband's 
qualifications from business dealing when employed by EI/EECC.

I submitted Bob's resume on line for this position, in fact there
were two positions, one for Director and Manager.  Within a week he
received a phone call from a Mr.Peter Weinberg of Human Resources to discuss
the possibility of an interview and to discuss in further detail about his
experience.  Mr. Weinberge and Bob corresponded a number of times
that week, Mr. Weinberge requested on a Wednesday evening that my
husband fill out an questionnaire that would further demonstrate Bob's
qualifications.  Mr. Weinberge stated that he needed it by Thursday so he
can present this to the hiring manager, Mr.Martin Gleason.  Bob was lead to believe
that he had a possibility of an interview.

No additional correspondence was again heard from Mr. Weinberge, in fact,
through other sources, I found out a candidate was extended an offer for the
position on Thursday.

 Both my husband and me were not upset that he did not get an interview, but
was disappointed with the lack of integrity from HR.  If HR had a candidate
in mind, why would they contact my husband and have him take the time to
work on the questionnaire?

It is understandable that they offered the position to a candidate, but Bob
should have received some type of correspondence from the HR representative.
Bob did call Peter in June and Mr.Weinberge told him that he was
surprised that my husband never received any correspondence from the hiring
manager.

I fully understand that internal candidates should be considered first, but
it is very disappointing to see the situation handled in this manner.  The
company prides itself on open Communication and Integrity, but this is not
the first time such an occurrence has happened.
.
Since the first initial contact between Bob and HR, there have been a few
positions posted in the Global Markets area.  The postings have stated they
are looking for candidates  with transportation/contract negotiation experience,
and not once did we hear from HR for a possibility of an interview.

I do not know if this letter will change anything, but I could not just let
it go.  I thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to
review this.  I look forward to hearing from you.
