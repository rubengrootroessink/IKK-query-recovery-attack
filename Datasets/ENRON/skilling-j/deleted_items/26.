Hello Everyone!

I'm Andy Cunningham, a member of the 2001 Board of Directors and Chairman of Communications for the YPO International Executive Committee.

Several weeks ago I sent out an email announcing our plans to conduct an important research effort among the YPO membership.  We would now like to invite you to share your opinions with us by participating in an online survey.

As a reminder, we are conducting this research in an effort to better understand our current membership base and determine how best to attract this century's premier leaders to our organization.  During David Martin's term as Chairman of the International Board, YPO will be going through an evolution to continue to be relevant in the current, and tomorrow's, business world.  We believe this research is a first step towards meeting the vision of the Board.

To access this survey, please point your browser to:

We appreciate your participation in advance.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding this survey, please reply to this e-mail.



Andy Cunningham
