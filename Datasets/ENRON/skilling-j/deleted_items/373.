lou,

per our last conversation, i have a deal we wanted to get in front of you...

namely, would Enron be interested in helping set up a global market for
private equity... much like you've done in electricity, gas, broadband?
it's close to a $1T market and growing rapidly.  we think it would change
everything.

i'd like to set up a time to come down to houston and compare notes.

let me know what you can do.

all the best,
clay
