Jeff,

You and I have spoken a few times in various situations (at the MS, in the elevator, etc...) and I was wondering if you might be interested in sitting down over a Guinness or two sometime and chatting about electricity.  I work in Govt. Affairs, and focus on physical scheduling of energy and transmission at NERC and FERC (remember?  I sent you the picture of Gent in the Enron jersey).  I was thinking it might be interesting to sit down and chat sometime about the issues we're facing in a more "off the cuff" casual sort of atmosphere.  Any availability?
