Dear Mentors,

The Houston Technology Center has decided to cancel the August Mentor
breakfast meeting.
August is typically a busy month with late summer vacations and getting kids
off to school.

Our next meeting will be on September 27, 2001.

We look forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,

Massimo Marolo
Development Manager
Enron Loaned Executive
