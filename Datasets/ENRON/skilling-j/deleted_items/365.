   Thursday, June 14,  2001 Issue 30   EDITORIAL  Putting the  brakes on Re=
gulations   The past few weeks have brought home the reality of  just what =
sort of environment energy companies are working in.  For all the talk abou=
t deregulation across the globe, it's  become increasingly apparent that go=
vernments aren't quite  willing to give up their control over energy supply=
 and  distribution.    In Europe, EDF's expansion plans have been put on th=
e hot  seat by various governments not too thrilled about the idea of  the =
French company becoming a major player in their backyards.  Enron's recent =
problems in India only serve to highlight that  while Asia remains an impor=
tant place for investment,  governmental red tape remains a major impedimen=
t. The  Brazilian energy crisis has brought the Brazilian government  back =
into the mix with a vengeance. And in the US, California  is having a fine =
time going after a number of energy companies  on charges of price fixing. =
It would seem that the energy  companies can't catch a break wherever they =
