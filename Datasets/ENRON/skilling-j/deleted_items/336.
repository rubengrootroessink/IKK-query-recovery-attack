Dear Jeff
 
There aren't any "corporate speak" words that can express what I feel, so I will use plain English:  I am thrilled that I will be working for you at Enron.  I look forward to helping you and your team continue to transform Enron into the number one company in the world and into the best company in the world.
 
I have sent my bio to Steve Kean and will send him my list of my preferred California contacts.  By mid-week, I will send you a cleaned-up version of the suggestions I outlined in our meeting.
 
I look forward to the next steps.  It is an honor to be working with you again.  I pledge to you my very best.
 
Sincerely,
