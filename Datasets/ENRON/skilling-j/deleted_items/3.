Unhappy with your investment choices?
Is your broker adding any value?
Need to 'Rollover' your retirement plan from a previous employer?

Bares Capital Management, Inc. is an independent, Austin, TX based
investment advisor specializing in managing accounts for high-net worth
individuals and institutions. Unlike brokers, we are not compensated
through transactions, activity, or mutual fund sales commissions, but
instead through an asset-based management fee. Therefore, our
compensation rises and falls with the value of your account. We are
long-term managers who emphasize research. We employ a 'value'
investment philosophy that focuses on building a suitable portfolio of
individual securities that are custom tailored to help you achieve your
unique financial goals.

If you uncomfortable trusting your portfolio with a salesperson at a
Wall Street firm where conflicts of interest abound, and investment
performance takes a back seat to account activity, you may be a perfect
candidate for Bares Capital Management, Inc.'s discretionary
account management.

If you would like more information about Bares Capital Management,
Inc.'s management philosophy, please visit us on-line at
http://www.barescapital.com, or call 512-732-2389. We would be
happy to speak with you to discuss your current investment situation.
No fees, no obligation.
