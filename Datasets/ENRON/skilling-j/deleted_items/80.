Jeff,
I seldom hear of anyone as fearless  as you.
I'm a VC.  Small $10M fund I first started 3 yrs ago.  Delivered a 15x return. That incls total money placed, so the return could  increase as our portfolio companies mature. I'm currently preparing to raise a  second fund of $60M.  Why do I write?  I'm looking at technologies in  your territory.  Could certainly use your help....likely to be beneficial  to you too.  
If you are up this way, do feel free to  call.
Best,
Petra
