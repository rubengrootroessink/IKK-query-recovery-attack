If you participate in a ride or traithlon that isn't listed above, then it's considered a discretionary ride.  The cycling club will pay up to $20 for four (4) discretionary rides/triathlons. Once the maximum has been met, a subsidy of $5.00 will made per ride.

For reimbursement of a ride, please fill out the attached and return to me with the proper paperwork at EB2365c.  Ride reimbursements are made at the end of each quarter.
