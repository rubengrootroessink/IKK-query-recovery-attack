Now Your Journeys Are Even More Rewarding!

Introducing one of the most flexible ways to earn free nights at over
700 hotels and resorts in 80 countries, including Westin(R), Sheraton(R),
Four Points(R) by Sheraton, The Luxury Collection(R), St. Regis(R) and
W hotels(R)!

The new Starwood Preferred Guest(SM) Credit Card from American Express(R)
is designed with the frequent traveler in mind. Starwood Preferred Guest
benefits are built upon one simple idea: free nights in any available
hotel, anytime. Without blackout dates- anywhere. It typically
takes just three stays for a free weekend night. Plus, you can transfer
Starpoints at a 1 to 1 exchange rate to most of our 31 major airline
partners. And when you transfer 20,000 Starpoints, we'll give you 5,000
bonus miles/points so you have enough for a free domestic airline ticket
with most major carriers.

  using the Card. For example spending $50 at the grocery store can
  earn you 50 Starpoints!
- In addition to everyday purchases you also will earn 2 Starpoints
  for every eligible $1 spent at a participating hotel or resort.
- 1,000 bonus points on your first stay at a participating hotel or
  resort when you use the Card.
- 500 bonus Starpoints every time you use the Card at a participating
  hotel or resort in your first year of Cardmembership (Up to a maximum

  card at check-in.).
