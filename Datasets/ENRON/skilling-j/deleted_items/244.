The attached word document is the revised Clean Water Act Section 308 information request that is addressed to Mr. Skilling. The original document, which was received on or about July 9, incorrectly refers to Enron Corp. as Williams Companies, Inc. in the body of the information request. During my conversation with the EPA staff lawyers, they apologized for the error and stated that Enron obviously was not the only recipient of the Section 308 request. During the conversation, a staff lawyer also indicated that EPA would be receptive to granting an extension to the 30-day response time provided in the information request. This and other issues will be addressed with the agency once team members responsible for preparing the response have been identified by management.

Please contact me if you have any questions (3-7267).

Mr. Nutt,

Per my voice mail and your request, enclosed please find an electronic copy
of the  Information Request.  It is my understanding based on your
conversation with my colleague, Cheryl Rose, that it will only cause
greater confusion if we resend the Information Request to all recipients of
the July 2, 2001 version.  Thus, a hardcopy of the document only is being
sent to your attention via Federal Express.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Again, we appreciate your cooperation.

Respectfully,
Komal
