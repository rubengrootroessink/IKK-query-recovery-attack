2001 World Technology Award nominees 
ENCLOSED: 
The first issue of the WTN newsletter >>> "WORLD TECHNOLOGY INTELLIGENCE" 
WHAT: 
"INTELLIGENCE" is a vehicle for WTN members (primarily Nominators and 
Finalists/Winners of the 2000 World Technology Awards) and other leaders in 
the technology world to reach each other with the big ideas that might change 
the way you think and/or act. WTN's mission overall is "encouraging 
serendipity" (the 'happy accidents' which often drive the breakthroughs for 
science, technology, and business (and life). "INTELLIGENCE" exists to help 
spark the same sort of opportunities. 
PLEASE NOTE: 
"INTELLIGENCE" is designed to be easy on your eyes, even if it only appears 
on your computer screen.  It is in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, so if you do 
not have that program on your computer (you probably do), you can download a 
free copy at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html .  We estimate the download time for the newsletter itself to be less than 2 minutes (at 56K modem speed). 
NOTE: 
All of the category Award Winners and Finalists for the 2001 World Technology Awards will be announced at the World Technology Awards ceremony on 2 July here in London, on the last night of the World Technology Summit.
