aunch, beta testing in actual production environments was conducted at cust=

 provider has established a strong presence in southern China and is rapidl=

R needs to bring on new customers quickly without adding to headcount. The =
iCan Provider Suite, according to SOLAR's CEO, Hera Siu, makes this possibl=
e.   [IMAGE]  "SOLAR has saved significant administrative time and boosted =
our efficiencies by deploying the iCan Provider Suite," Siu says. "This has=
 freed-up staff to perform more revenue-generating tasks. With iCan Bill we=

s," she adds, "have improved through the notices we are posting with iCan V=
iew."  SOLAR was able to save significant administrative time on data colle=
ction and analysis by utilizing the iCan suite. The ASP was also able to mo=
nitor its data center's Internet connection. The streamlined operating envi=
ronment freed the SOLAR staff to undertake cost-reducing and revenue-genera=
ting tasks, such as improving capacity management and performing data back-=
up services.  With the suite's iCan Bill component, SOLAR was also able to =
centralize and automate its billing process, further reducing the administr=
ative work involved in consolidating and verifying invoices.  Customer comm=
unications costs were pared as well, by posting service notices through the=
 iCan View component in lieu of mail or e-mail.  To learn more about SOLAR =

- SERVICING THE ENTERPRISE   [IMAGE]  The 'software-as-service' model is be=
ing adopted by corporate IT, and the iCan Provider Suite enables IT departm=

age was well received last week at CA World in Orlando, Fla., where iCan re=
presentatives met with several hundred CIOs and senior IT managers and demo=
nstrated the advantages of the iCan Provider Suite firsthand. While there w=
ere many questions, especially concerning how best to service customers in =
various industries, there was also a strong consensus on two key points: 1)=
 The software-as-a-service model makes sense, because it helps IT more accu=
rately gauge and reduce costs, manage service levels and justify budgets; a=
nd 2) whether it's for internal users or external customers, th! e ! iCan P=
