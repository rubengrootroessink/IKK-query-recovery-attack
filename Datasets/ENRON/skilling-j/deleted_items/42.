Good Morning.  Pardon the lengthy email, but there's
lots to report.

We had a great meeting this morning, with tremendous
enthusiasm for where we're going.  Please find below a
recap as well as some action items going forward.

We had three companies present:  Metrixx, Molecular
Electronics Corporation, and Telecare International.
Those of you who are interested in attending follow up
meetings were encouraged to sign a sign in sheet with
your email address.  If you are interested in
attending the follow up meetings or receiving details
on the results of those follow ups and did not sign
up, please send an email to Kathy Nethercutt at
knethercutt@houstontech.org, .  Once we have a list of
names, we will forward information specific to each
company to those angels who have indicated interest.
The scheduled meeting times are as follows:

Metrixx:  Monday, 8/20 8:00-10:00 AM
MEC:  Wednesday, 8/22 2:00-4:30
Telecare:  Tuesday, 8/21 7:30-10:00

In the case of Molecular Electronics, please ignore
the $250k minimum.  There are Angels already working
to put together an LLC to pool capital for purposes of
meeting this minimum.

The next HAN Steering Committee meeting is scheduled
for Monday morning, at the Houstonian, from 7:00-9:00
AM in the regular location.  Kerry Brooks will follow
up with a reminder email.  Also, we are working on
putting together a schedule of Steering Committee
meetings so that we can all mark our calendars in
advance.

The next HAN meeting will be on September 19.  The
location of that meeting is yet to be determined, but
will be announced via a follow up email.  In the next
meeting, The Steering Committee will deliver the
following:

**An explanation on the specific structure of HAN as
an organization
**An overview of the deal-flow process and how
companies get presented/moved through to investment
**Details of how HAN will overcome Member liability

Please also note, that HTC will be having an event at
the Houstonian on September 20, for Angels who are
interested in becoming more involved in biotechnology
investment opportunities. Because of our medical
center and the growing, national interest in biotech,
Houston-based Angels are uniquely positioned to take
advantage of these opportunities.  More details will
follow, directly from HTC.

Lastly, I have attached an Angel application in Word
format.  Please feel free to complete/submit the
application electronically to Kathy at HTC.  HTC can
accept payment for the $1,000 membership fee via
credit card, over the telephone.  Remember that those
Angels who apply prior to the end of the next meeting
will have their dues paid through 2002.  Also, please
pass the application on to those ACCREDITED investors
who may be interested in joining or any that you have
already recommended whose contact information may not
be in the HAN database.

Again, I'm looking forward to helping build a great
Network.  Let's keep the momentum going!
