Per our conversation earlier this week, attached please find our latest report on the Argentina financial crisis.  You had suggested that this could be important for Jeff Skilling to read.  If so, it will probably have more impact if you forward it on our behalf.

Let Brendan (x54763) or me (x39934) know if you have questions.

Robert
