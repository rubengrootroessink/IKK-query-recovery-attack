We have had so much positive feedback on the HBS breakfast club program
that we are already planning for the fall.  The schedule will be the same,
the first and third Thursdays of each month starting in September.  You can
sign up until July 1 for $140.  The regular cost will be $150 with a guest
fee of $23.

The topic for the final breakfast on June 21 will be Retirement: How do you
plan for it and what do you do?

Please contact Dottie Kerr at 281-424-3084 or dottie@kerr-solutions.com to
sign up for next year and please let me know if you have any comments or
ideas on how to make it an even better program in the fall.

Best Regards,
Sean Daichman, President
