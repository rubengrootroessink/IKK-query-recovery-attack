Jeff... As you may know, I recently shut down Viant's operations in Houston
and have been considering several alternatives.  Could you spare a twenty
minutes for us to get together as I would value your advice?

While we have talked a few times, you may not be aware of my background.
Would sending you a bio be helpful?

Thanks in advance... Walter.
