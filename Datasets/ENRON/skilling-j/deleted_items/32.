Mr. Lay,

My name is Jynell Scott Holliday.  I was hired to work contract at Enron (E=
CT) in April, 1997.  I was  contracted to work in the IT department as a He=
lpdesk Coordinator.  I worked very hard to prove myself and exceeded the ti=
me limit given to me to which I had to complete my project. With that I was=
 very innovative.   I created forms to make the environment move in an effi=
cient manner.  In January, 1999, I was hired by Enron (EES) to work at thei=
r helpdesk as a technician.  I then proved myself to be worthy and capable =
of completing any task provided to me.  The requirements composed of an (Se=
rvice Level Agreement) SLA of first call resolution.  I did not have a prob=
lem with the requirements as noted in my evaluation.

In April 2000, the decision to transition to IBM was presented to me.  I wa=
s very pleased with working  at Enron and I was very disappointed about the=
 transition.  I did not want to go work for IBM.  Not because IBM was a bad=
 company but because I thought Enron was a great company.   The visions and=
 values concept that Enron diplayed really made me feel safe and comfortabl=
e as long as I was doing my job, to which I was.  I was, also, told by a VP=
 during the beginning of the transition  that "If anyone did not won't to g=
o to work for  IBM they  did not have to." I took the statement literal.  I=
 attempted with all my power to stay with Enron.  After trying vehemently t=
o stay,  I was told that I did not have a choice and I had to go with IBM o=
r  unemployment.  I still continued to find out what I could  do to get a j=
ob back at Enron.  I applied for multiple jobs and I rarely heard from anyo=
ne. =20

Well, as you know, the IBM contract is gone.  I tried again to be replaced =
back at Enron as an employee.  I did everything I could to be rehired by En=
ron.    I was interviewed, however, It was unprofessionally handled.   Afte=
r all this I have seen  the values  be misplaced.   I have had experience w=
ith Enron and I would like to know why it  I was not rehired.  I have never=
 been told that I did not do a good job. The reason I am writing this lette=
r to you  is to find out why I was not chosen to continue what I started an=
d wha it would have taken to keep get a job at the company I had so much re=
spect for.  Since, I was still at  Enron working on the  IBM @ Enron projec=
t, I have been a loyal, respectful and an innovative employee and  I would =
like to know why I  was not given the opportunity to get a job here. This r=
eally concerns me.   I know that you are not obligated to reveal this infor=
mation however nothing has been communicated to me and I feel that this is =
something that anyone would need an answer to since my work ethics are expl=
icable and I my records reflect that I  would have done a great job for Enr=
on.

Sincerely,
Jynell Scott Holliday
