CONGRATULATIONS TO EACH OF YOU FOR A 
STAR-SPANGLED PERFORMANCE

TEAM ENRON'S TOTAL FOR THE 2001 MS150:

This is an amazing amount of money, and it brings our rider average to over $2000 - an absolutely awesome average for a team of 450 members. "Can't Stop The Momentum" is a very appropriate tag for Team Enron.  I'm proud to know you and share the road with you as we continue on our quest to do our very best.   Your spirit and dedication have inspired thousands of riders in this city and this nation, and you have definitely brought home the GOLD!  The National MS Society thanks you, your pedal partners thank you, Enron thanks you, and we look forward to a re-ride with you in 2002!

The very best to you !!!
