Steve
 
It was great to meet you in person.  I am very excited about becoming part of the Enron team.  Thank you for your time and insights over the phone and in Houston. 
 
I am attaching my bio.  By Tuesday, I will send you the contact list that we discussed.
 
Please call me if you have any thoughts or questions.  Happy 40.
 
Kevin
