			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

On Friday, it was reported that Industrial Production fell by 0.8%  in May,
after falling a downward-revised 0.6% in April. Additionally, Capacity
Utilization fell to 77.4%, its lowest point since August 1983. This data
increases the odds of a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal
Reserve at the June 26/27  meeting.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.68%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.22%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.67%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.82 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.08 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

in-line w/QCOM's modest earnings guidance, revised post
2Q01. We believe revs & EPS in 3Q of $627M & $0.21 remain achievable. 3Q
chipsets likely to be approx. 14M in period, w/range

& US are trending broadly in-line w/01 ests.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Exodus Communications(EXDS) 2 - Buy H. Blount, .212.526.9128
Meeting with Management (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $4.61 EPS 2000 N/A -$0.54 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $69 - 4 EPS 2001 -$0.65E -$0.65E -$0.61E N/A
Mkt Cap: $2.4B EPS 2002 -$0.19E -$0.28E -$0.16E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $15 $9
Rank 2 2
*We are maintaining our Buy rating but reducing our 2002 revenue forecast
and price target.
*EXDS management recognizes the challenges ahead and is making progress on
multiple fronts.
*We believe the 2Q conference call will be critical to reigniting equity
interest in the company.
*Churn peaked in March and has trended down sequentially, however, the macro
environment remains challenging. Therefore, we are
reducing our 2002 revenue forecast from $2.5B to $2.0B and our price target
from $15 to $9.
*EXDS has $1.1 billion in cash and $450 million in remaining bank lines
available. We continue to believe the company will receive
a waiver on its bank line covenants.
*We believe the previously announced cost reductions and lower capex will
allow the company to reach cash flow positive. However,
the company must begin demonstrating progress in 2Q01.

Carnival Corp(CCL) 3 - Market Perform F. Kantor, .212.526.5562
Expecting Downward Revisions for Remainder of the Year
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $26.40 EPS 2000 N/A $1.64 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $35 - 18 EPS 2001 $1.62E $1.62E $1.66E 16.3
Mkt Cap: $15.5B EPS 2002 $1.85E $1.85E $1.93E 14.3
FY: 11/30 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*The current economic overhang coupled with an aggressive capacity build-out
for at least the next 3 years leads us to maintain our
cautious outlook on the industry as a whole.
*CCL reports 2Q01 EPS on Thurs 6/21. Our EPS est of $0.30 vs $0.32 (in line
with the street) assumes a net yield increase of 3%.
Given anecdotes of pricing weakness in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe, we
believe that our net yield outlook is too high and thus
our cruise revenue est of $1.08bn (vs $845.3MM) is at risk. CCL could meet
our EPS est, though, given lwr op exp per PPCD,
SG&A or interest expense.
*While CCL's 10.5% retreat from its recent high of $30 seems to imply that a
2Q disappointment is factored into the stock, we
maintain that further downward net yield revisions could cause the shares to
trade closer to their July 2000 levels implying a stock
price of $22.

CVS Corp(CVS) 1 - Strong Buy M. Adler, .212.526.7146
Strong Overreaction = Buying Opportunity
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $47.55 EPS 2000 N/A $1.80 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $64 - 33 EPS 2001 $2.10E $2.10E $2.10E 22.6
Mkt Cap: $19.5B EPS 2002 $2.45E $2.45E $2.42E 19.4
FY: 12/31 Price Target $66 $66
Rank 1 1
*Friday, a sell-side competitor downgraded and lowered estimates on CVS
based on a survey his team conducted. This survey was
conducted to attempt to further explain the recent deceleration in pharmacy
comps that began in March and concluded that shortage
of pharmacy staff and the EPIC pharmacy system were to blame.
*CVS countered these conclusions and stated the weaker flu and allergy
seasons, the lack of blockbuster drugs introduced, and the loss
of a managed care contract all contributed to decelerating pharmacy sales
*While we acknowledge that CVS is experiencing a labor shortage in a number
of its markets, we do not believe this is a new
phenomenon. This is an industry-wide issue that all drug stores are and will
continue to experience into the future.
*The stock is down tremendously as a result of the downgrade. We believe
this is an over reaction and view this as a buying
opportunity. We reiterate our 1-Strong Buy and maintain our estimates of
$0.52 for 2Q01 and $2.10 for FY01.
