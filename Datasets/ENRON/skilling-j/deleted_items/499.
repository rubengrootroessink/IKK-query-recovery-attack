In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.
