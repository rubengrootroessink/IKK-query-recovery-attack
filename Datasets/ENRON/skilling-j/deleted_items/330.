Ken, Jeff and Louise,

Below please find links for the Multimedia version of the Harvard cases completed in final form last month.  The text of the multimedia case is the same as that previously forwarded.  I have reviewed these multimedia cases and they are very cool!

I will be forwarding Releases to each of you for signature.  Please return the releases as soon as possible as Meg Wozny at Harvard, with whom I've been working on these for the past few months, is leaving HBS at the end of June--I'd like for her to have the satisfaction of finalizing this project before she leaves.

Harvard reports that these cases are best sellers!  Also, we enjoyed an "Enron day"at Harvard April 26th; it received such rave reviews that Harvard has requested a similar event for this summer.

Thanks to all of you for your participation and help!

--Christie.
