>Dear Mr. Rice:
>
>Further to the call today, I have been referred to you by the office of Mr.
>Skilling.  For added background, I have had the pleasure of working with some of
>your US and Asian-based executives on transactions, notably Mike Gaffud in the
>Philippines regarding the sale of an equity interest in Subic Power, and meeting
>some of your board members including Mr. Ronnie Chan of Hong Kong, while working
>abroad in Asia. This follows a banking relationship with you all from a Bank of
>America stint.
>
>I am in touch on a newly-formed entity, TeliOn Broadband, of which I am a
>partner.  It is an early mover, capital efficient fixed wireless integrated
>service provider (WISP) owning last mile applications in the focused markets we
>have researched and chosen.  Many of which are already in markets that Enron has
>presence. Attached please find the executive summary for your review.
>
>We are in the process of our Series A launch and beta tests.  After meeting
>internally and given national scalability, would like to invite Enron
>Corporation and its affiliate, Enron Broadband Investments, to review as a
>potential partner for this round. From what we understand, there seems to be
>some complementation to your current wireless communication interests and
>broadband initiatives. Supplementally, there may be a relationship to explore
>regarding co-location on certain tower sites. At an appropriate future point,
>there may be a couple of third party co-investment structures, in addition to
>Cisco Systems interests, for possible discussion.
