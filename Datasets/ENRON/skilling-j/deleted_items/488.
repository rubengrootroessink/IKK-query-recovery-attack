Dear Joannie:
 
Dan Hutton just  contacted me and mentioned you'd be willing to forward this letter to the  appropriate IT development group(s) within Enron. While we offer incredible  programming services, we have had some difficulty in reaching the appropriate  parties within Enron.
 
Thank you very much for your assistance. If  you have any questions about our services, please contact me at  (512)917-6509.
 
Kind regards,
 
Jim Yang
