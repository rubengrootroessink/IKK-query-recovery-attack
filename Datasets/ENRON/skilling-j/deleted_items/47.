Dear Fellow Enron Cycling Club Members,

The Houston Press is conducting its annual "Best of Houston" survey.  One of the categories typically analyzed is the best area bike shop.  I would like everyone to consider submitting a vote for West U Schwinn.  Recall that the owner of West U Schwinn, Jeff Neilsen, attended and spoke at several of our pre-MS 150 cycling club meetings.  Jeff also provided free bike inspections during our MS 150 kick-off party in front of the building.  Finally, his shop offers larger discounts to Enron Cycling Club members than any other bike shop in town, both on services and supplies.

To vote, simply go to <http://houstonpress.com/bestof/2001/boh2001/poll>.  For some reason, this year "best bike shop" is a write-in category, so please vote on any other category you are interested in and then add the bike shop category and West U Schwinn's name at the end of the ballot (in the Best Category We Forgot box).

Thanks for reciprocating the support Jeff and his shop provided to Team Enron.

Regards,
Bill Bowes
