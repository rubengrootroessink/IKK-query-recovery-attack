Attached is a DPC press release that we would like to issue in India on Saturday morning their time.  Due to coverage of related issues, this timing is important.  We have been advised that these facts need to be disseminated to be responsive to the judge's remarks and before the Mumbai High Court  hearing scheduled for next week.  

The DPC press release is significantly more detailed than normal Enron practice, but is deliberately styled to be appropriate for an Indian audience.  In fact, we anticipate that a number of Indian publications will run the release verbatim.  Of course, this will likely result in international coverage, as well.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

John
