I am requesting Jeff for a speaking engagement with the Houston Minority Business Council for their Emerging 10 Awards Luncheon.  The event is planned for November 15, 2001.  However they are flexible on the date.  I would like to know Jeff's availability for the week of Nov 5 and Nov. 12.  
 
Enron is a big corporate sponsor of HMBC.  This awards luncheon is to recognize the top 10 emerging and growth minority companies in Houston. It is expected that 600 to 800 people will attend the event.
 
Thanks for your consideration.
