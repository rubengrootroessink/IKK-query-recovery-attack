Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.
