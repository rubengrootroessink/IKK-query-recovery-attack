RE: Balancing Risk and Opportunity: Gas and Power Markets Beyond the California Crisis - A CERA Executive Summit 
August 22-23, 2001, La Costa Resort, Carlsbad, California 
Dear Mr. Skilling: 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates is pleased to extend a special invitation for you to participate in a CERA Executive Summit to be held on August 22-23 at La Costa Resort, in Carlsbad, California. 
At the Summit, CERA will present its independent, forward-looking scenarios and objective insights on the strategic, investment, and regulatory challenges for California and Western North America, as well as the related implications for other energy markets across North America.  The latest agenda updates can be found on the CERA Web site at http://www.cera.com/event/carlsbad/ . This site will be updated regularly to keep you abreast of program developments.
In keeping with the traditional CERA format, the August 23rd Summit is designed to foster interactive senior-level dialogue on the critical choices ahead. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the program includes networking activities such as golf, a cocktail reception, and dinner. To facilitate high-level interactions throughout the Summit, CERA is limiting enrollment to 150 senior executives and government officials.
The Summit will be chaired by CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin and will also feature insightful presentations by our experts on California and electric power, including Senior Director Larry Makovich and Director of Western Energy Mike Zenker. Summit participants and commentators will include key senior policymakers, as well as representatives from CERA client financial, distribution, generation, production, and trading companies. 
Your views would be of great interest, and we would truly value your participation in the Summit. The participation fee is US$5,000, but we are pleased to extend a special discount of US$2,500 for members of our Western Energy, North American Gas, North American Power, Global Power Forum, Retail Energy, Distributed Energy, and Electric Power Transmission Advisory Services. The Summit agenda and enrollment information can be found on our web site at:  http://www.cera.com/event/carlsbad  .
A formal invitation will soon reach you by regular mail. To register before receiving this formal invitation, please complete the PDF enrollment form on the event Web site and fax it to +1 617 498 9176. 
  
If you are unable to join us, we hope that you will pass on this invitation to an appropriate senior representative within your organization. We hope to see you at the Summit.
Sincerely, 
Ron Kapavik 
CERA Director, North American Energy
