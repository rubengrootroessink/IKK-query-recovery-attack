Hello Mr. Skilling:

I am going to be joining the Enron Associate Class of February 2002(from The
University of Chicago).

Sir, I have a question.  I was wondering what your thoughts might be regarding
the creation of an operation to trade interest rate products?  I am certain
that yield curve exposure is a significant source of risk that certain areas of
Enron must already be addressing.  However, to the best of my knowledge,  I
don't think Enron actually trades interest rate products?

If there is any interest in doing so, I would be very pleased to offer my time
to assist in researching the potential feasibility and profitability while
still a student, and before I report to Enron.

Yours respectfully,

Kamran Gill
