Mr. Lay:

Is your Gulfstream going in for major maintenance?  If your answer is yes, you are possibly thinking charter to fill the gap.

Well, we have an idea!  Dry lease our client's GII SP for a period of six to 12 months.  This low-time aircraft is ready to go to work for you next week.

Give us a call at 520 544-0100.  It will be a pleasure to hear from you.

Weldon Riker
President
