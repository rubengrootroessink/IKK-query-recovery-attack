If you have any information or reason to believe HTC should not advance the following company to Member status, please e-mail or call me immediately (within 2 business days).

Rotary Steerable Tools (RST) designs and manufactures patented, directional drilling tools that can replace traditional drilling technologies.  Rotary steerable drilling is a new technology that refines and improves the ability to drill the directional well; it is superior to steerable motor technology and could eventually achieve 90% replacement of this older technology.
