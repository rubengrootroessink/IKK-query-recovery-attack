Jeff -- Bruce Nichols of the Dallas Morning News is writing a profile of Ken Lay (as a counter to all of the negative press lately).  He'd like to talk to you briefly to get some comments about Ken, his work at Enron and in the energy industry.  I've scheduled a 10-minute phone call at 11 a.m. Wednesday.  I'll come to your office to place the call.

Thanks.
Karen
