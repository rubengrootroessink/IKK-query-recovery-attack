Enron Kids Volunteers Needed
The Enron Kids Committee is looking for additional volunteers to help plan for another successful Enron Kids year.  We are in the early planning phase for our holiday event.  This year's school is Gordon Elementary in the Bellaire area.  Gordon has 98% of it's student population that qualifies for free or reduced lunch.  

To join the planning committee, please contact Lillian Villarreal, via email or phone (xt. 37092), to be added to our distribution list.  Meetings are once a month, until we get closer to the December event, when we will meet at least twice a month.  The Enron Kids program has consistently been among the top Enron events in terms of employee participation.  We look forward to our employees again supporting the children of Gordon Elementary through Our Enron Kids program of 2001.
