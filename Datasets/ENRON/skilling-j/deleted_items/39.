This is to confirm that the Forum meeting on Monday 8/20 will be at 6:00
PM at Vin-De-Garde.  Mike had thought about having the meeting somewhere
else, but decided against it.

Mike asked that everyone check their calendars for next year's couples
retreat.  The date that was chosen was April 25 - 28, 2002.  This needs
to be reconfirmed.  If you have any questions, please give me a call at
713-361-7205
