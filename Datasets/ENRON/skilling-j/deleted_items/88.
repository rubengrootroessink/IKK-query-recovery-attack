     Dear Mr. Skilling:

     Thank you for requesting electronically the previously mailed
     information concerning my background.

     I truly appreciate your help and assistance as it pertains to how
my
     experience and involvement in the successful operation of
Independent
     Power Plants may be of interest, and value to Enron.

     I can be reached for any further discussions or information by
calling
     my cellular phone at 908-727-3189, or home at 973-328-1093. When
your
     schedule permits I would be very interested in meeting with you to
     discuss in person my background and possible ways of contributing
to
     Enron's on going operations.

     Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

     Bruce C. Studley
