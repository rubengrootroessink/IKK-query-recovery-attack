Mr. Skilling, 
Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in the interesting program that you are sponsoring in October.  Unfortunately, I have a conflicting commitment and will be unable to attend.  May I pass the information on to one of the other Commissioners here, or have you also invited others from our commission?
Thank you. 
Camie Swanson-Hull
