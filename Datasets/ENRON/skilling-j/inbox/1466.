Dear Tracy and Richard,

Here is Jeff Skilling's endorsement for Strategic Supremacy:

In Strategic Supremacy, Richard D'Aveni proves to be as thorough and accomplished an historian as business strategist.  Through intriguing parallels, D'Aveni demonstrates that now, as throughout history, anticipating, creating, interfacing and re-inventing markets, while managing risk, is the ticket to leading and succeeding.

Would you please email your fax number?  I can then forward to Richard some information that contains our most recent numbers.

Thanks!  Let me know if we can help in any other way.

Best Regards!

--Christie.
