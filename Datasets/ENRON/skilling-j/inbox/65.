Mr. Skilling,

Rev. Lawson would like to thank you for extending to him the invitation to
participate in the 2001 Big Cats Gala on June 14, 2001 at the Bronx Zoo in
New York.  Unfortunately, he will not be able to attend the event, and the
Wheeler Avenue budget for this year is not such that we can comfortably make
a contribution.  He would like to convey to Mr. Lay, however, that he
rejoices with this esteemed honor and will continue to keep his friend in
his prayers.

Thank you,

Roxanne Lawson-Troup
Administrative Assistant to Pastor
