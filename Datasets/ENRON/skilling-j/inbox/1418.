Dell, 
Hess is alive and well in Tulsa, Oklahoma preaching every Sunday at the  
Southern Hills Baptist Church.  Yes, that Southern Hills. I wave to Hess  
every Sunday on my way to the course!  I would have him bless my balls but  
brotherhood only goes so far.  Maybe he could find Mom Pinchbeck and have her  
do the blessing.  If Mom isn't available, then how about Ellen Parker.  Say,  
did she ever return that shit covered blanket to Drow?
