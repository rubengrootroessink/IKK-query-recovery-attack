Carl, I (another card-carryin' Republican who once played the part of Sir H.
Rape Brown de Black Knight in Cumalot) also have apparently changed my ways
of thinking over the years.  And, in these times of PC, one cannot afford
not to -or at least to project a believable image that he/she is a convert.
And right now the National Fraternity is under this same microscope and
acted, though somewhat precipitously, with the "bigger picture" in mind.
That's why I made the suggestions which I did.  And, I hope that none of
them - though different than yours - offended you.  I was merely trying to
throw in the benefit/ignorance of my own experiences in such matters.  And,
today, while thinking further own the subject, I thought that as part of the
"game plan" I suggested last night, the chapter might consider involving
some of its more influential, and credible alums and identify the same type
of alums from the Black fraternity.  Then, when meeting with the
all-important intermediary, a suggested meeting between the alums from the
two frats and the intermediary be made.  I can't decide whether I would want
to suggest including student representatives from the two frats at this
first meeting.  I seem to come down on the play of having a second meeting
with the alums from both frats with the intermediary and include selected
student representatives (non-hotheads from our side) to attend and take an
active role in the negotiations.  From there, if all goes well - a BIG
"if" - the same groups can then have a big meeting with all members and
pledges from both frats (maybe dangerous) or have separate meetings with
each frat (less volatile) where the enemy representatives attend along with
the intermediary.

news story, another missed opportunity?  After all, we went to SMU for the
same reason they are at Auburn now.  Most of us are or will be amused to
look back at some of the unexpected sources of the lessons learned.
