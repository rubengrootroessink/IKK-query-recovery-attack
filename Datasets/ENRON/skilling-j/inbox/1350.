Mr. Skilling,

In view of the market and economy today,  the fact that my firm is
taking aggressive steps to enable our clients might be of interest to
you.

Please take a moment to view amscsearch.com and look at the 'In the
News' section.  Perhaps this will entice you to invite us to become a
contributing part of the Enron team.

Most sincerely,

Kelly Crescenti
