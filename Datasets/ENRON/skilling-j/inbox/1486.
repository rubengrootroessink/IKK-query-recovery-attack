RY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES  STAFF WRITERS  The Securities and Exch=
ange Commission has launched a  preliminary inquiry into whether energy con=
sultants advising Gov. Gray  Davis used inside information to trade stocks =
of power companies doing  business with the state, a source with knowledge =
of the matter said  Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last =
week, the  source said, in response to a request from California Secretary =
of State  Bill Jones. A Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock=
 trading  by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and =
selling  based on information not available to the public.  On Friday, top =
 aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for  =
possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their  =
personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital  M=
onday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who  =
in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure  records fi=
led by the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, show that he  owns between=
 $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company he and his boss have  accused of m=
aking "obscene" profits while California has been "on its  knees." Maviglio=
 said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in  1996.  "It's no=
t a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio  said.  He also owns 300 shares of=
 San Jose-based Calpine Corp.,  which has the largest share of the $43 bill=
ion in long-term state power  contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the=
 stock on May 31, one  day after San Jose's mayor dropped his opposition to=
 a controversial  Calpine plant favored by the governor and others. Under t=
he terms of  Maviglio's purchase, the transaction was completed about three=
 weeks later  when the stock reached $40 a share, a value of $12,000. It ha=
s since  fallen in value.  "I viewed it as a good long-term investment,"  M=
aviglio said, adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement  accou=
nt based on publicly available information.  The Davis  administration has =
spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it  has leveled at other =
electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But  California's grid operator has i=
dentified the company as one of many  energy merchants to overcharge the st=
ate millions of dollars.  The  fired consultants also owned shares in Calpi=
ne, ranging in value from  several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, =
records  show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs  s=
ecretary Barry Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that  he=
 recently held between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state  com=
pany accused of multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a  statement, Goode =
said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after he  began working fo=
r the governor in February. Goode said the shares were  supposed to be sold=
 before he went on the state payroll, but his broker  failed to do so.  In =
light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of  State Jones said the governo=
r must do more to ensure the public that its  interest comes first.  "The g=
overnor should direct all of his staff  to immediately file updated conflic=
t of interest statements that reflect  current holdings and any activity si=
nce their last statement of economic  interest was filed," said Jones, who =
is seeking the GOP nomination for  governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into =
California's energy problems  comes as the governor faces harsh criticism f=
rom lawmakers and others for  the quick and broad hiring of highly paid pri=
vate consultants to guide him  through the crisis.  In his written request =
to the SEC, Jones said  that recently filed disclosure documents showed tha=
t at least one  consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies w=
ithin the same  month, raising "a red flag" about the possibility of inside=
r  trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in  decisions=
 involving their personal financial interests.  The five  consultants fired=
 last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,  delivered to the San Fran=
cisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was  not clear which individuals=
 are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether  the agency's review would =
result in any charges.  Two of the former  traders said Monday that they ha=
d not been contacted by federal  investigators and knew nothing of an inqui=
ry into possible insider  trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said =
it is no mystery  why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead =
said he  bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended it=
 to his  colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the now-defu=
nct  California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on=
  that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead  and =
three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and  March--were=
 terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying  power for the=
 state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired  traders Herman=
 Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the  date of their C=
alpine purchases on financial statements that the state  required to be fil=
ed only two weeks ago.  "But I'm sure they bought  it while they were still=
 at the power exchange, because that's when we  discussed it," Mead said. "=
It was kind of like a hobby. I'm sure it wasn't  done with the intent to ma=
nipulate."  Former trader Elaine Griffin,  who also owned Calpine stock and=
 resigned two weeks ago to take another  job, said she didn't know she owne=
d energy securities until she checked  with her financial advisor July 13, =
just before leaving her state  job.  Griffin said she and her husband own a=
bout $10,000 worth of  Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts mana=
ged by their advisor,  who bought the stock Feb. 1 without their knowledge,=
 she said, after  research found it to be a good investment.  "I kind of fe=
el like  we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said. "We would ha=
ve  disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."  As a  trader=
, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state,  but on=
ly at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political  consultants, who=
 helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy  crisis caused his =
poll numbers to plummet, have agreed to accept no  payment for their work a=
s part of an out-of-court settlement of a taxpayer  lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk,=
 a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist  Lewis Uhler, said the settlem=
ent was reached last Friday after  negotiations with lawyers for communicat=
ions consultants Mark Fabiani and  Chris Lehane.  "Now they will not receiv=
e one red cent," said  Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane ha=
ve agreed to cease all  activities for the governor, to accept no payments =
for their services and  to basically get out of the consulting business wit=
h the  governor."  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler  with=
drew his lawsuit Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit  against the tw=
o consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June  contending that they=
 should not receive any payments because of a conflict  of interest. The tw=
o men also did consulting work for financially troubled  Southern Californi=
a Edison, which was seeking help from Davis and the  Legislature.  Connell,=
 a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who  has been at odds with Davis si=
nce he endorsed an opponent, had held up the  payments pending the outcome =
of the lawsuit.  Under an agreement  with Davis, the men were to have been =
paid $30,000 a month for six  months.  Fabiani and Lehane could not be reac=
hed for  comment.  *  Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia  Ellis i=
