Harry Jim,
   I'll be there on 8/24 come hell or highwater.  Keep  me posted.


Yours in -kai-,
Drow

PS. You won't believe this and neither will Grumbles or Coburn, but I, Drow
Berry, have now played golf twice in a week's time, for the first time in my
life.  My game sucked as much as always but God did I have fun playing with
my sons.  Adam even gave me a new set of woods for Father's Day.  I said,
"What the hell are these for?"
