    Thursday, November 01, 2001 Issue 40   EDITORIAL  In this edition...  .=
..we take a closer look at the state of play in the green energy market, an=
d also at technologies, not planned or anticipated, but with us right now t=
hat can bring alternative energy strategies to fruition.   There are just a=
 few remaining places on the delegate register for the Eyeforenergy Green C=
onvention in Brussels next week, so if you are intending to go and haven't =
yet registered - please do so today!   In 'Going Green: The Bottom Line', t=
he first of our two articles on green energy, Abyd Karmali, VP of ICF Consu=
lting, points to the increasing importance of emissions trading as a key en=
vironmental issue.  We also examine the relative market share currently enj=
oyed (or lamented?) by the main renewable energy initiatives: wind, solar, =
biomass and fuel cells.   Speakers are lining up rapidly for our three co-l=
ocated events in Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002: Energy Trading Online, Wea=
ther Trading and Emissions Trading.  Recently confirmed include Enron, LIFF=
E, TXU and NatSource.  The programmes for all three are likely to be filled=
 over the next couple of weeks, so if you are interested in speaking please=
