Fartie Artie Kretz, Rag-Man Stewart, Space Hosman , (and Strap Anderson was
mentioned ) !

What a day ! First of all, I want to apoligize to Kevin Stewart for not ever
getting together with you and Sandy since you moved up here. I promise to
rectify that situation in the near future. I don't know wether you consider
that good news or bad. Instigated by Space's referance to -KAI- .

As for those roll numbers , I always thought they did it alphabetically ! I
was #460 and I thought I was last in our class ( although we were first in
pledge class GPA.) Who was #459 ? After spending a week with my hand on his
shoulder I should know.

And Tocks - I never replied to your e-mail. I do still play golf, have a 5
handicap, and hope to play better than it. If you, or any Beta Bros., get to
the NY Met area in decent weather I play at a club you all would enjoy -
really tough and NO FEMALES !  I would love to see anybody that could make
it and have a little get together. Perhaps our Beta intermural team - four
players with a total handicap of 8 and we didn't win the trophy !

Hess and Woody - your info regarding our political and spiritual leadership
is well received. Hess, you can't beat yourself up over decisions you made
30 years ago. You reacted the way you reacted then and thats it. You can
only learn from it and move forward and know that your future decisions will
be better for your experiences.

On a lighter note, my third child, Scott, is a freshman  student/lacrosse
player at Washington & Lee in Virginia and is real serious about pledging
some fraternity ( not a social organization ) called Beta Theta Pi. He
doesn't want them to know that he is a triple legacy because he doesn't want
to be called " Flounder "  or Mr. Dorfman.  But he has already been to a
TOGA party. History does seem to repeat itself if you're not wary.

Elvis- HELLO !
                                                        Later............
#460    -KAI-        ZEBA
