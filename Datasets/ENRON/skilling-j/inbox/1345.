Hi Jeff,

Today's most challenging business and technical problems require and generate mountains of data. Managing this data explosion has become an incredibly complex task.

New implementations always require moving data from the legacy system into the new application. Products, components, customers, vendors and employee data - everything must be moved. And it doesn't always come from just one place. Sometimes data from multiple systems must be moved to one big 'integrated solution'.

The issues involved in data cleansing, formatting, converting and preparing for upload are so time consuming and so exacting that it makes sense to outsource select components of the project to an established firm with extensive experience in data migration!

How do you meet this challenge?
