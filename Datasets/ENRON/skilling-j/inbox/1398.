Chuck - are you aware that Jeff Skilling resigned as CEO from Enron this week
citing "strictly personal reasons" ? It was in the business section of the
Tulsa World (our newspaper). The former chairman of Enron has had to step back
in & assure the market that it was not due to financial problems in the company
- strictly a personal decision by Skilling, which "the Board regrets".
Jim.
