Dear Harvard Alumni:

I am a recent Harvard College graduate (June 2001) and have moved back to
Houston to develop an HIV/AIDS youth education project.  I was temporarily
collaborating with the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative
(BIPAI) at the Baylor College of Medicine and am now seeking to partner
with AIDS Foundation Houston.  I aim to launch Grades4AIDS in H.I.S.D.
during the 2002-2003 academic year as either an AFH project or an
independent NPO.  This organization seeks to simultaneously promote
academic achievement, community service, peer-to-peer HIV/AIDS youth
education, and youth leadership while also fundraising for pediatric AIDS
research and support.  The following is the basic premise of our project:

A corporate sponsor will agree to donate $0.50 (this amount will be
corrected annually with increased participation) per B+ or above (or
equivalent measure, i.e. 88-90) that every participating student receives
during every grading period.  Peer tutoring and interscholastic incentive
programs will encourage students to achieve.  Participating students will
engage in an active dialogue about HIV/AIDS and have myriad opportunities
to get involved in and lead peer education initiatives and volunteer in the
Houston HIV/AIDS community.

What I am seeking from the Harvard alumni in Houston is support in the form
of contributions of time and/or money.  We are currently putting together
an Advisory Board and Board of Trustees and working hard to fund our
project and operational costs through May 2003.

Please visit our website at www.grades4aids.org for more information and
feel free to contact me at dmkim@post.harvard.edu.  I can also be reached
by telephone at (713) 932-8822.  Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Dona Kim
