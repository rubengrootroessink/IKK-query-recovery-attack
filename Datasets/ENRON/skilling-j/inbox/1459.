Beta Brothers:

I, like many of you, enjoyed many a fatty on the Beta roof back in the
mid-1970s. But unlike Rocky Skilling, my hair did not fall out. It seems,
though, that I am few million short of the daring dynamo who now runs the
fucking world from Houston.

Many snaps for Brother Skilling. I still remember him throwing up in Arends'
shoes. But certainly, that doesn't preclude him from winning Beta's highest
honor.

I will be in Dallas the weekend of October 6 and would like to attend the
festivities if it doesn't conflict with the greatest football game on the
planet -- that, of course, being the contest down in the Cotton Bowl between
Bevo and the Mighty National Champs from Norman. You see boys, I am now a
full-blown Okie with a book to prove it. By the way, it's no longer
Texas-OU. It's now OU-Texas.

Now that we are on the subject, I am throwing an awesome bash in Norman at
the Sam Noble Museum on the evening of August 24 to unveil The Undefeated.
No, it's not about the Beta footballers of our junior season, but rather
that 47-game winning streak back in the fifties that made the Sooners world
famous. Berry, Benson, C-Di and Grumbles have confirmed. So that means we
will need bail money. Send lawyers, guns and money -- the shit has hit the
fan.

Let me know at jdent@mmcable.com or 405-858-0166.

Again, congrats to Brother Rocky, and get your butts to Oklahoma.

(By the way, Drow, you were slower than a dry creek, but you were Hutch's
favorite and that's why I never got the ball).

Brother Del Dent
