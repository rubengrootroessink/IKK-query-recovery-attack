  I have worked in the market data industry for over 15 years and feel I bring a unique perspective to the field.

  I recently started a market data consulting practice and would be interested  in speaking with you regarding helping you promote your services within the Financial Services and Information industries.

  I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you at greater length.

  Sincerely,

  Judah Seidman
