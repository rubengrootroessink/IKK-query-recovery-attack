Words can never express my heartfelt gratitude for the funds you made available to those of us who suffered losses because of the flood.

The experience was so overwhelming.  The devastation of so many was heart wrenching.  Your generosity is so awesome, and I appreciate all that you are doing to help others as well as myself.

God bless you and thank you.

Sincerely,
Betty
