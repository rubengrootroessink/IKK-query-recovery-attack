Hello, Jeff,

I just wanted to let you know that I'll be at a mandatory Values meeting
(you remember those, right?) from 2:00 to 4:00 pm. EST and will be back in
the office by 5:00 p.m.  Hope this doesn't mean we miss one another.  If
there's a problem, please e-mail or call me with a number you can be
reached at today/tonight and I'm happy to contact you at a time of your
convenience.

Warm Regards,

Wylie
