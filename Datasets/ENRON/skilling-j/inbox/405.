Dear Jeffrey:

I came across your name in the business press. As an industry leader you are
knowledgeable about the latest trends and where the companies are heading. You
constantly meet top managers and some may be hungry for management talent
and/or require rapid change action.

What value can I bring?

I have nine years of combined experience in management, change consulting,
international marketing and business development.  Most recently, I took part
in transforming Fortune 500 companies into more active e-business players.B
 efore, in four years I have developed international markets from 0 to over 40
country coverage, 140 companies and units (mostly in Europe, but also in the
Middle East and in Asia).

I am looking for right opportunities and growth challenges.

If the organization wants to speed up their international expansion and avoid
some costly mistakes, I can bring in a successful record of developing business
and resources in country-to-country approach, balancing
think-global-and-act-local theme.

And/or

If the organization can benefit from broad range of change experience: I led
project teams of art designers and copywriters achieving national promotion
goals, led researches towards addressing relevant issues in their projects, led
consultants in delivering management change programs for major corporations,
led the creating of new customer and supplier networks globally. These were
project teams representing diverse experience, background, and management
levels.

And/or, finally

If you would like to share your insider's perspective on where the industry is
heading in exchange I can provide my insights into developing business in
Europe.

I am flexible on location and only a phone call away.


Sincerely yours
Robert Rogowski
