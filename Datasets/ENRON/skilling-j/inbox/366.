It was nice to see you on the panel.  As promised at the Summit, under
separate mail I have sent the Korn/Ferry brochure, "What Do Employees Really
Want?  The Perception vs. The Reality."

As I also mentioned to you, Siemens is in the process of targeting Enron as
one of the top 20 key accounts in the country. We envision you as a
trendsetter as well as a high-potential customer.  I hope to be able to call
on you if we need top level feedback or run into unforeseen barriers in our
attempt to be a premiere supplier to you.

Regards,
Gerhard
