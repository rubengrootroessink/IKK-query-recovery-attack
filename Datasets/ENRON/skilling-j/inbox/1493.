Jeff,
=20
I am Dr. Mona Yousry.  You don't know  me.  I earned my PH.D. in Mathematic=
s in 1982 and have served in the  Telecommunications industry for 19 years.=
  I was recruited by Bell  Laboratories, AT&T, Ameritech, and Sempra Energy=
. =20
=20
I have always been impressed by Enron's  performance and business strategie=
s.  I believe you were instrumental in  what Enron is all about today.

I read an article about you and your zealous interest in Africa.  You  need=
 to meet Larry Robinson.  The following is in his words.  Please  read it.

My father was born in Zimbabwe, Africa. My parents and grandparents were  M=
issionaries. My grandparents went to Africa from California in 1912 and are=
  both buried in Africa. I was raised in very remote areas of the Belgian C=
ongo  and from an early age spent lots of time in the African Bush. This wa=
s a time to  learn many of the secrets necessary to survive the African bus=
h and love it. I  had the opportunity to study and learn animal behavior in=
 ways that most experts  only dream about. Some of my greatest memories are=
 from times I would take a  pocket full of salt with my rifle and go into t=
he bush for 10 days to 2 weeks at  a time, sometimes totally alone. It was =
also a time to learn about the African  people and their languages and cult=
ures. As time passed and Independence swept  the Continent, I saw Zaire, th=
e great land where I was born, turn into a blood  bath. I learned more abou=
t the most savage creature of all. As I saw men  slaughter men, women, and =
children, I understood better how organized and  balanced nature really is.=
 I am a U.S. Citizen and Resident in Tanzania, East  Africa. I am tri-lingu=
al and understand three other African languages. I have an  FAA Commercial =
Pilots license. Educated in Cape Town, South Africa, Singapore,  Beirut, Le=
banon, Michigan, and California. Have two B.S. degrees. One in  Agriculture=
 and one in Industrial Education. Have traveled around the world many  time=
s. My longest overland trip was from Germany to Cape Town driving my own  T=
oyota Land Cruiser. This was a 10 month journey of over 30,000 miles. Cross=
ing  the Sahara Desert and the Kalahari Desert before a GPS was available w=
as indeed  a great adventure. From 1985 to 1992 I owned and operated my own=
 Import Export  Company in Central Africa called "Malaika Zaire".  Presentl=
y I am Managing  Director and Chairman of the Board of "Solar Universal Net=
work" - a Californian  Non-profit Organization, 501(c)3. Solar Universal Ne=
twork is also established in  Tanzania as an International NGO since 1995. =
S.U.N.'s primary focus is to  establish safe, permanent, water supplies for=
 communities in Tanzania using  alternative energy. An example of our work =
is at Sukenya, Northern Tanzania  where we are pumping approximately 12,000=
 gallons of water per day from 250 feet  deep for the Maasai Community usin=
g only Solar Energy. This system has been  operating for a year now with ou=
tstanding success. When necessary, we also use  UV Water Purification Units=
 powered by Solar Energy to purify any contamination  which may exist in wa=
ter supplies.  One of the areas we are now working in  is located in Northe=
rn Tanzania just South of the Kenya boarder and just East of  the Serengeti=
 National Park. This is considered Maasai Land and is fascinating  country.=
 Each year hundreds of thousands Wilderbeasts migrate south through this  a=
rea to give birth to their young in the Southern plains of the Serengeti. T=
he  great migration is considered one of natures last unmatched marvels on =
earth.  This is the time when the predators like lions, leopards, cheetah, =
and hyena are  roaming the area. There are also heards of Cape Buffalo, Ele=
phant, and many  types of antelope and zebra. Because of the Community Deve=
lopment that S.U.N.  has done in this area, we have an exceptional opportun=
ity to hike, camp, and  hunt with the Maasai in this location. I have perso=
nally been within 10 yards of  a lion and his kill while on foot with a Maa=
sai warrior and only a spear in  hand.  Tanzania is also the land of Mt. Ki=
limanjaro, Serengeti National  Park, Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Victoria, and =
Zanzibar  Island.
