HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF '73)                         
  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a JOKE!  I have 
arranged to have the "JUNIOR COLLEGE'S" TOWER here in Austin demolished, as 
it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton Museum.  The tower will 
never glow orange again.  It's also on the second tier target list for the 
raghead's next flyby.
Best regards.  -KAI-
At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
