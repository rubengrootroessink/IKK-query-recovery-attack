> Enron CEO uses naughty word on conference call
>
>     By C. Bryson Hull
>     HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s <ENE.N> top
> executive Tuesday publicly fired off the same vulgarity that
> brought President George W. Bush embarrassing headlines when he
> unwittingly uttered it in front of an open microphone last
> fall.
>     But unlike Bush, Enron President and Chief Executive
> Officer Jeff Skilling says he knew the microphone was on when
> he called a fund manager an "asshole" during a conference call
> to discuss first-quarter earnings with analysts.
>     Bush made headlines on the campaign trail last year when he
> remarked to Vice President Dick Cheney that a New York Times
> reporter was a "major-league asshole," not knowing that a
> microphone had picked up his remark.
>     Skilling laid down the insult after an exchange with
> Richard Grubman, managing director of Highfields Capital
> Management in Boston, who asked to see Enron's balance sheet
> and was told it would not be available until its inclusion in a
> Securities and Exchange Commission filing later this month.
>     "You're the only financial institution that can't come up
> with balance sheet or cash flow statement after earnings,"
> Grubman grumbled.
>     "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that. Asshole,"
> Skilling responded with a laugh.
>     Skilling, whose candor frequently gives his public
> relations staff fits, told Reuters in a telephone interview
> that he knew the microphone was on.
>     "The specific fellow that I was not real happy with is a
> shortseller in the market. I don't think it is fair to our
> shareholders to give someone a platform like that they are
> using for some personal vested interest related to their stock
> position," Skilling told Reuters in an interview.
>     "I get a little exasperated with that sort of thing, and I
> want people to know I am exasperated," he said.
>     Grubman said he felt "pretty thin-skinned" about the
> remark.
>     He disputed Enron's assertion the balance sheets and cash
> flow statements were not ready yet, particularly in light of
> Skilling's mention during the call that Enron reconciles its
> credit risks and trading book daily.
>     "I'm sort of at a loss as to why that was such an
> objectionable question," Grubman said, adding:
>     "He's got some nerve. He and his management team sold 7
> million shares into the market last year, so he's plugged the
> market for a half a billion dollars worth of stock valued in
> the $70s and $80s.
>     "Now the stock is the high $50s-low $60s and I'm an asshole
> because I ask about the balance sheet?"
