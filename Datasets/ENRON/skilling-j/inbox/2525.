Zeebs,  I can only report on El Shelden.  El has lived in Portland, Oregon for the last 20+ years.  I saw her out there about 2 years ago-we had a blast and she is doing great.  Her e-mail is elrod@pdx.com  I'm sure she would get a big kick if you sent her an e-mail.  Barry Bertin-have no idea. 
 
C-Paul

ELVIS :
 
FINE !..........I always liked you better when I thought you were from Summit, NJ. The reason for the question, d---head, was since I didn't get a response from Mr. Haulenbeek I thought , perhaps, I wasn't reaching him, especially since there had been some talk about some Betas no longer being on the list, etc, so there. And please say HELLO to the very lovely Margaret.

C-PAUL and Artie :   Thanks for responding in a very civil and cordial manner. It shows you are at least educated and have developed manners!   By the way Chuck, what ever happened to those people we played spades with : El Sheldon, Barry etc ?

HELLO 
Zeebs, you've been using this site for weeks and you still don't know how it works? I've got some lake front lots for sale that I want to discuss with you. I'll make you a Beta brother deal.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
