Good morning, Jeff.

	I caught Frontline's documentary on "Blackout" in its entirety this past Tuesday evening on PBS and found it quite interesting.  I was very impressed with both you and Ken Lay the way you bounced back the answers to the commentator's questions.  I've been with the company for 3-1/2 years and I am so proud to work with your organization more than ever!  This company houses a lot of support for you!

P.S.  I am looking forward in joining you, and other MS 150 participants, tomorrow for lunch at Damian's.
