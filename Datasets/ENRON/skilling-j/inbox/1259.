******************************************************************************
Last year, only 6% of all venture funding from across the US went to companies with women CEOs.  Only 41% of companies that received venture capital had women within their executive ranks.  When it comes to raising venture capital, women-led firms still have a lot of catching up to do in order to narrow the gap.
 
Houston Technology Center is pleased to announce our involvement with a venture capital forum that is taking proactive measures to narrow that gap-- Springboard: Southwest 2002.  In the one-day forum produced by the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs-Texas and the Springboard Venture Forum Series, an audience of over 250 corporate, venture and angel investors will evaluate investment opportunities from 20 of the top women-led companies from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Arizona and New Mexico.
 
Springboard Enterprises is a national non-profit venture whose  mission is to increase women's participation in equity capital markets.  Springboard Enterprises' six forums to date have showcased 175 women entrepreneurs and have resulted in women-led ventures raising over $450 million in funding.  Judging by this record, HTC is optimistic that Springboard: Southwest 2002 has great potential for accelerating the growth of local women-led ventures and for narrowing the gap in Houston and across the state.
 
To build awareness of and excitement for the Forum, which will be held in March 2002 in Dallas, HTC is hosting the Houston Launch Event on October 2, 2001 at The Houstonian.  Registration will begin at 2:30 p.m., with the entrepreneurial educational program beginning at 3:00 p.m. and lasting until 6:30 p.m., including a reception for all stakeholders.  Your key questions about accessing funding and the current landscape of venture capital will be answered by a first-class panel of investors and experienced entrepreneurs including:
 
Teresa Bosco

Nancy Chang, Ph.D.
CEO, Tanox, Inc.

The  Launch Event brings together the region's entrepreneurs, investors and professional service firms for the purpose of making connections.  While the Forum is still several months away, now is the time for women-led ventures, investors and professional service firms to learn about the opportunities Springboard offers.  Leading investors and professional service consultants are already enlisting to screen the 500 plus applications and to coach the entrepreneurs selected to present at the Forum.
