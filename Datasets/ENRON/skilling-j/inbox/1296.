VOTENET ACQUIRES eCONTRIBUTOR
Firm Emerges as Online Fundraising Market Leader

WASHINGTON, D.C. (September 7, 2001) - In a move expected to dramatically alter the scope and significance of online fundraising, Votenet Solutions, Inc. (<http://www.votenet.com>) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of eContributor (<http://www.eContributor.com>).  Also headquartered in Washington, DC, eContributor became the industry leader last year by providing Internet fundraising software to a wide range of clients that includes trade associations, PACs, non-profits including faith-based organizations, educational institutions, presidential campaigns, national and state political parties, as well as numerous congressional campaigns.  Over $10 million in online contributions have flowed to almost 500 customers using the market leading eContributor online fundraising software.  Votenet Solutions is a non-partisan, non-ideological technology solutions firm that provides a suite of products and services for political, public policy and non-profit o!
rganizations.

Speculation regarding the acquisition of eContributor by Votenet had been building for several months prior to today's formal announcement of the completion of the acquisition.  "Votenet is pleased to welcome eContributor's almost 500 customers to its growing customer base that is now approaching 2,000 organizations.  eContributor built its reputation based on providing stellar customer service and Votenet promises to emulate and even improve on this high standard," stated Mitchell Reisberg, Votenet's Vice President of Sales.

Glen Hughlette, Votenet's CEO observed "Billions of dollars are contributed to non-profit, charitable and political organizations annually.  Each year a larger percentage of these contributions are moved online.  I am pleased and thankful that Votenet had the financial wherewithal to successfully accomplish this asset acquisition and overnight secure the market leadership position in such a strategically important and fast growing market.  The eContributor software perfectly complements many of our other related solutions but especially our web site hosting and marketing package."

Trey Richardson, eContributor.com's CEO stated, "eContributor is much more than just the market leading online fundraising software solution.  It is the most efficient way for organizations to raise the funds they need to accomplish their goals and objectives.  And the organziations' mission statements can be as different and diverse as raising funds to conduct medical research, build a new clinic, influence the direction and outcome of legislation and regulations, or win an election for public office.  Funds can be raised for less than 10 cents on the dollar using eContributor online fundraising software.  A dramatic difference when compared to the 70 cents on the dollar cost of using phone solicitation, and 50 cents on the dollar cost of using direct mail."
