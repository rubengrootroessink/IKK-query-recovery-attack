[IMAGE]=09 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   Selecting the right gift or=
 seasonal accent to adorn your home  or office is made easy with our origin=
al bouquets, orchids and  preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items=
 has its own  character and ambience and is meant to complement the good li=
fe.   Take our Orchid  Blaze Bouquet  (shown right) for example. With its f=
iery orange  orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal ce=
nterpiece.  This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.   The Colmana=
ra  Orchid Plant  is quite possibly the most exciting new orchid  to be int=
roduced in the last decade. This alluring orchid, nicknamed  ?Wildcat? is d=
iligently sought-after for its long lasting  blooms.   Our Antiqued  Holida=
y Wreath  is a preserved design whose color scheme works  with most decors.=
 It is available with our brass wreath hanger,  making it a breeze to displ=
ay. And don?t forget the ideal  autumn birthday gift! The Golden  Harvest R=
oses  bouquet is sure to add special meaning to a  wonderful occasion.  Rem=
ember to visit Autumn  Sales  where you will find keen gifts like the Autum=
n  Jewel Arch  at very special prices!  Calyx  & Corolla   =09[IMAGE]=09
