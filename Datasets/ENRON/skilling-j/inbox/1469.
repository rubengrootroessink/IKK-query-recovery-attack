On behalf of the entire Marketing team, I want to thank you for your candor and time in participating in the off-site last Friday.  

Your vision and personal observations of where and how Marketing can play a more important role for the organization was timely and very well received by the team.  Today, we have a better idea of the areas you would like to see targeted externally and internally i.e., employees. We appreciate your flexibility in exploring new ways to get our messages out and in entertaining new data and proposals throughout the year.
