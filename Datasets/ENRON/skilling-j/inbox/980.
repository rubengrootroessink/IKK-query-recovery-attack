Hey Chuck you Ol' Fart!  (After 40, we all meld together and age equally;
i.e. we're all Ol' Farts).
Anyway, it's great to hear from you and yes I remember you too!  Tell
Grumbles I said "Hi" and to
send me an e-mail and tell me what he's up to.  The last time I saw him was
at the House during
Homecoming about six or seven years ago.  I remember seeing Grumbles,
Foladori, Tom Duran
from the great old town of Goldthwaite, Texas, Bruce Sparling, and a hell of
a lot of the ol' gang
except most of the guys from my class and before.

Foladori just recently joined my law firm as a Partner and he has said that
he plans to be at Homecoming
along with a lot of the guys from his class ('71) since this is their 30th
reunion.  (I had mine two years ago!)
I've got my FB season tickets, my SW Airtlines reservations and and a hotel
room, and my wife Phyllis
and I will be there too.  I hope that you, Grumbles and a whole slew of the
guys I remember will be there
as well.  I f only the guys from my own class and before would get
interested and start participating, it'd be great!
I've been going to home and away FB games for years, and I never see any of
the Brothers who were there when
I was younger.  Maybe we can use this site with the help of our young Alumni
Director (Andrew McCarty) to
shame some of the old bastards to show their faces.  I will say that Carl
McCaffrey and Fred Dotts do come to the
games; but they're about the only ones I ever see.  Sadly, that holds true
for most of my friends from my class years
whether they were Betas or not.  This needs to be fixed!

Dick Dent '69

P.S. Beek, I look forward to both seeing and meeting you and some of the
other guys from your class/es at Homecoming.
