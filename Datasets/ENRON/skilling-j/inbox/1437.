Dear Jeff,

In case you do not recall my name, I organized the Conference series for
PDVSA that hosted President Bush (41), Lou Noto, Harry Longwell, etc. in 96,
James A Baker III, et. al. in 97 and Robert Mosbacher , Jeff Skilling and
others in 98.

Anyway, today after reading the Wall Street Journal, it could appear
outright impertinent to contact you. I chose to believe exactly the
opposite. Attached you will find an invitation to an interesting energy/ IT
event. I think you will be able to judge the merits of attending on your
own. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all the best in your
upcoming professional opportunities.

Best regards,

Tony

Antonio M. Szab?
