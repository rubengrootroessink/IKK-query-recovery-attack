    =09  So how's your golf swing? Platts invite you to get that slice, hoo=
k, or entire golf stroke fixed by the Swing Doctor at Power Mart '01for fre=
e!  Just drop by the Platts Pavilion (a huge mega-booth at the front of the=
 hall-you can't miss it). The Swing Doctor himself, Fred Collins, will be t=
here on October 16 from 11:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and on October 17 between 1=
1:30 and 6:00. Call 800-424-2908 before October 8, 2001, to receive your Co=
mplimentary Exhibit Pass.  Fred founded Golf Perfection, wrote The Constant=
s of the Swing, and is one of only 116 Master Teaching Professionals certif=
ied by the PGA-ever. He'll analyze your swing and give you the same kind of=
 attention he gives to top pros. All for free!   And while you're shaving s=
trokes off your handicap, pick up some sample copies of our publications, l=
ike Gas Daily, Megawatt Daily, Transportation & Storage Hub, Generation Wee=
k, and all the rest. Meet some of our editors (the smart folks who bring yo=
u the info you rely on) and shmooze a little about the state of the marketp=
lace-maybe even pick up some tips there, too.   So plan to spend a few minu=
tes with Fred. He'll make a difference in your golf game, just like Platts =
