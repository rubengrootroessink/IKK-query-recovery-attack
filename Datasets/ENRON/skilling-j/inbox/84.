Put me down for $150.  I'll mail you a check in UK sterling which I'm sure you'll get converted by a US bank.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)
