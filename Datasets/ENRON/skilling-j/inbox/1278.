Brothers,
    Linda Grumbles just informed me that John is not recovering the way the
Drs. want him to and that the same artery may be blocked again, or even
closed.  In other words, the first catheter treatment didn't pan out.  He
goes back in for another one, this time probably installing a stint in the
artery to keep it open, next week on Sept. 14.  His email address has
changed and it's now jgrumbles76@hotmail.com.  I'm certain he and Linda
would appreciate your keeping them in your prayers.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.
