Dear Mr.. Skilling,
Given the current events of the last several years  regarding power generation and delivery across our nation, I have a  proposal, I'm sure will interest you. 
First, with your position with Enron, you must be keenly aware of the issues  that we face as a nation, and direct impact which the energy markets  have on our economic health.  Additionally, you must also be aware of the  capacity imbalance from region to region, lack of capital improvements  by the incumbent utilities, ISO's etc, all of which has created a situation that  our national grid is in a state of degradation, in which even the delivery and  transfer of existing capacity is questionable, must less the additional  generation which is being added. This has rendered our national grid, with its  many segmented regions to slightly above that of a third world nation. 
This lack of capital investment has been exacerbated by a lack of clear  direction by the vast number of regulatory bodies, and general lack of  aggressive entrepreneurial motivation and vision by the various utilities to  develop creative solutions to issues which they have a vested interest to  resolve, but haven't. It appears that there are vast  opportunities available to an aggressive, first mover organization which  can pull together the resources,  and bring all the players together along  with the capital markets to initiate, develop and build additional capacity or  to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer. 
While the Bush Energy Policy goes a long way towards bringing federal backing  to developing additional generation capacity, it appears to fall short regarding  the transmission systems that cross our nation,  of which many are already  straining under a heavy load, which is only anticipated to grow.   Additional transmission capacity must be built, including additional  interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects  strengthened.  The ability to transfer power from the east coast to the  west coast, as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east, or  the ability to transfer power from such area's as Nova Scotia which has an  abundant supply of inexpensive Hydro Power would certainly be the ideal  situation.
What I propose, is the development of a new Enron company, of which its  vision would be to identify and develop opportunities to build various  transmission assets, and/or additional generation capacity or to strengthen  existing assets.  This would be accomplished by bringing various players  together under the Enron lead,  and working with the capital markets to  develop a strategy, allowing for the asset to be built. All the while keeping in  mind, the asset light and capital velocity approach. It would be the goal of  this new organization, not to own the physical asset, but to retain  the rights to a portion of its capacity. This capacity could then be  traded or used for power transfers from regions with inexpensive supplies to  areas that shortages exist.  I envision long term inexpensive contracts for  Nova Scotia hydropower; being transferred to such area's as New York,  the  Midwest, or even California.
While such an idea is not unique,  with several proposals   being considered by various organizations across our country. Such as the  following:

Path 15, long recognized as the major  transfer constraint between North and Southern California. Recently, WAPA has  issued a solicitation for equity participation, in which private organizations  could participate, in the financing, building  and ownership with  rights to its capacity. http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2001/June/Day-13/i14874.htm 
Neptune Project a private initiative in the New England states being  proposed by a group of companies, mostly non-utility for except ABB. This  project has recently been approved by FERC and is currently soliciting bids  for capacity rights, ownership, etc. http://www.neptunerts.com/ 
 
TransAmerica Project another private  initiative being proposed by Black & Vetch along with Siemens. The  scope of this project is to build a DC line between the east/west grids,  thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 MW. This project has  already been presented to the National Energy Committee put together by  President Bush as a viable project and potential solution. http://www.bv.com/bv/news/pressrel/2001/bv_siemn.htm 

 
While great idea's are plentiful, the problem is funding from the capital  markets, or an organization with proven leadership and track record to pull  off such a project.
This is just the beginning, and given the historical lack of investment in  the grid, many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with  the foresight to put together the team to capture them as they come  available. I envision that this organization would work in conjunction with  TranConnect , which Portland General is currently a member, in order to expand  or compliment their efforts. 
It's my opinion and that of many others, that the only organization on this  planet, with the financial strength, entrepreneurial vision, superior management  along with political clout, to pull all the components together to make  this a success, is Enron. 
As a former Enron employee,  I am extremely familiar with a number of  the organizations, which make up Enron, and feel that this would certainly  compliment or augment existing operations.  
While I'm not with Enron as this time, I certainly am proud of the  contributions I made while with such a progressive organization and I am  extremely interested in meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss  this proposal and it's fit into overall Enron strategic plan. 
For further discussion, I can be contacted at (602) 758-4544 (Cell) 
Regards,
Mike Stefanik
