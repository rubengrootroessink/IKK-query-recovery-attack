Bothers,
    After seeing my first son pledge Phi Sig at Georgia Tech 6 years ago,
then my second boy pledge UCLA baseball four years ago, it is with great
pride I announce that young Joe Berry  just accepted a bid to become a
member of Beta Theta Pi at Auburn University.  He called me tonight with the
news and it is just sinking in as I type this.  I figured it would be the
last thing he would do, due to his persistent individualism all his life.
It's a really neat feeling to have a son as a Beta.  Very difficult to
describe.  Thank God I'm a Beta and I hope to be a better one.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow


PS.  He first told me he had pledged Sigma Chi, his pledge class was 47, but
only 30 expect to make it through, that 3 of the actives are known
homosexuals, one of his pledge brothers is a midget, that pledge football
practices are at 5:30 a.m. (mandatory) and he would have to drop one of his
classes to get through pledgeship.  I pretty much bought all of it until the
dropping of the class bit.  Guess Joe has been paying attention all along to
the concept of the Beta Dick.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
