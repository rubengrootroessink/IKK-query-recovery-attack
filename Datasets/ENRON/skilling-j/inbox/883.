Randall,  thanks for your concern!!  Sorry you won't be there to witness any
of the upcoming events!  I understand that Bill Grumbles '71 will be in
attendance at the game to unveil a bust that was done (commissioned by Bill)
for Payne Stewart-should be a neat event.

C-Paul

I had contemplated the trip but unfortunately will not be in attendance.
Hope every one has a safe and sober Homecoming.
In my absence will someone please be in charge of taking care of Chuckles!

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.
