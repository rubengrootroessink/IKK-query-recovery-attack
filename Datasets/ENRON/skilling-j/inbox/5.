Hi MARK!
       The pictures arrived today.  Your letter was dated April 6 so it took
ten days.
       Tell Sukran Mother and I think she is beautiful.  We sure enjoyed
seeing them all.  I made copies for Sue and Tom and will mail them this
afternoon.
      Thank you so much.  LOTS  of LOVE and KISSES to YOU and Sukran from
MOTHER and I.     DAD
