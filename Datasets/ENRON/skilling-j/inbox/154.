Dear Richard,

As per my conversation with Jeff Skilling last week in which he suggested that I contact you, I would like to request the names of the companies who we outsource some of our accounting needs to.  I would like to target them for our latest product: Data Storage Capacity.  Please let me know how you would like me to proceed regarding this matter.  Thank you.
