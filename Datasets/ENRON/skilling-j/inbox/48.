Jeff, I wouldn't be too concerned about calling you-know-who an asshole.  I don't think it hurt "W" too much, and it gave us all something to talk and/or chuckle about.  I am very fond of using it myself, but my favorites are "dickhead" and "dickbrain."  In fact, I used them so frequently that my husband urged me to use a Spanish translation, which turned out to be Ricardo Cabeza and Ricardo Sesos (pronounced "say-sos").  Please feel free to use those anytime you feel the urge.

Seriously, thanks for the good things that are happening at our company.  The stock is looking better, and us old folks appreciate that.  Hope you are taking time to enjoy life as well.  Are you doing the MS150 this year?  Good luck in all your endeavors.  Fondly, Peggy
