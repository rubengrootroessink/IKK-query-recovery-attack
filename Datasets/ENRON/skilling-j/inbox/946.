Hello Jeff,

Regardless of the present state of Wall Street and the rest of the US
economy, the choke point in business growth today is-and will continue to
be--talent rather than capital.

Hawkes-Peers & Co. is an executive search firm based in NYC. What
characterizes our candidates is their current and recent experiences. We
specialize in identifying opportunities for top-tier consultants from the
premier strategy firms--McKinsey, Bain, BCG, AT Kearney, and Booz Allen--who
have either rolled out into industry or are looking to move into the
corporate sector. These candidates also share the qualification of an MBA
from one of the elite business schools: Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, Stanford,
or Kellogg.

We target this group of individuals on an ongoing basis, maintaining an
active dialogue with them, so we know exactly whom to identify for
appropriate opportunities. Our network allows your organization to be highly
selective while saving invaluable time. You pick and choose among the most
talented strategic, operations, and management consulting professionals;
they build the future strength of your company.

If you have an interest in the pool of talent we represent, I would be happy
to provide you with more information. I can also send samples of our past
introductions as well as resumes provided with the candidates' permission.
Please let us know if there's any way we can help you.

Sincerely,

Georgette Semaan
Hawkes Peers & Co.
