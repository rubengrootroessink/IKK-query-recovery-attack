TO THE BEEKSIMONIAN INSTITUTION OF GAMMA OMEGA:

DAMN, I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE I COULD KICK IT OVER YOUR HEAD AND STILL GET IT UNDER THE F'IN BAR!!!!!

I relived that awful moment tonight for my two nieces (Joe and Ellen Stutts' daughters) Sarah and Katy and one of their neighbors (Parker Hill) that plays soccer for Tomball High School (the only Texas High School team to go to Mexico, D.F. representing the U.S. high schools against Mexico's, and several South American national high school teams).

And I am sure you are asking what occasion would cause me to recall this day of infamy for these young titans.  Young (and lovely) Sarah has a car packed tonight and leaves for her freshman year at (yes, that's right) S M U tomorrow.  Are there any Beta legacies that she should know about out there?  Let me know who I should be in touch with, old Keeper of the Flame.

Some of our mammaries are (sorry, 'paging Dr. Freud') memories are more painful than others, but I would not trade the opportunity to make them for anything in this world or most of what we get later.
