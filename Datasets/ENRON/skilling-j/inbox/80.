Jeffrey,

During the past 12 years Noble Systems Corporation has moved to the forefront in providing the world's best "total solution" value in call center and customer contact technology.  10,000+ agents at more than 500 client installations in 7 countries, conduct business from feature-rich Noble Systems workstations.  Over 2 million customer calls are managed every day through our full spectrum of ACD, Predictive Dialing, Blended Call Processing, Digital Recording, and CRM systems.  With corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Noble Systems also has offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia to manage the rapidly growing international demand for our unique solutions.
N
 oble Systems is part of the SR. Teleperformance group, a $700+ Million Teleservices conglomerate with over 120 call centers in more than 30 countries.  This business relationship financially empowers Noble Systems to aggressively pursue the most complex contact center applications on a global basis.  It also provides us with the largest research and development environment in the industry for testing new technology and software applications, within actual customer operations, prior to full-scale market release.

ATOMS
, our award winning call center automation system, is a fully open, highly customizable and scalable technology platform, utilizing the latest hardware, database system, and telephony technologies.  Robust functionality within ATOMS empowers clients to design sophisticated campaigns without programming, leverage real-time decision making tools, achieve ultimate agent productivity, increase agent retention, and maximize overall campaign performance and results.  These powerful capabilities place Noble Systems in the leadership position of providing the industry's most comprehensive and affordable customer interaction management solutions.

Our network-wide Graphical Manager workstation software is setting entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity for managing agents and campaigns! The current release now enables you to include each agent's picture on your real time production displays. Our next release will enable you to lay out these agent icons on your management displays into the same floor plan as your center - depicting each agent where they are actually sitting.

Coming this week is another new release of our Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB 2.6) which continues to set new standards in productivity. DCB is the realization of a dream in that non-programmers now quickly develop and implement complete contact applications. We hold the 2 day DCB training class every week!

We've also introduced two new sales promotions this week for new customers (see attachment).

If you have not done so recently, please check out our improved website at www.noblesys.com Among other enhancements, you will appreciate the new Search capability; simply enter keyword(s) and you can quickly get to the items of interest including the earlier press releases and customer success stories.

Jeffrey, if I can be of any assistance, please advise.
