Mr. Skilling,

Joannie suggested I email you a note regarding KPMG's tax solutions
developed specifically for the executive who is exiting, exercising stock
options, monitizing stock, and recognizing gain. We work in concert with
your financial advisors and have forged many relationships with
institutions, investors and brokers  to bring cutting edge tax ideas
together. KPMG's Personal Financial Planning is dedicated to developing tax
solutions for those interested in deferral, minimization , and mitigation of
personal income tax.

The attachment gives a brief description of some of our Innovative
Strategies.

As a side note,  I am sure you have know the Lay Family and Sharon and JT
have been friends of my parents and my husband and I for years through
sailing at the Yacht Club at Lakewood and HYC.

I do hope you consider allowing me and my partners a few minutes of your
time, to share our Tax ideas with you. If so, have Joannie call me at my
numbers below.

Best Wishes



Melinda Dobbs
