Dear Jeff,

Been a while.  Hope you are yours are doing OK after the tragedies in NY and
DC.  Unfortunately, I lost a friend who was working at WTC.  Been a bit hard
to get back to the normal aspects of life.

Will update you on some of the more relatively mundane but exciting
developments on my end soon. Currently just starting discussions for a
potential CEO role at an enterprise software company.

Hope things go well for you.

Regards,
Narry Singh
