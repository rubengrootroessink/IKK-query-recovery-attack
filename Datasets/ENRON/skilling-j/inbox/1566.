Mr. Skilling,

I am new to Enron (about 2 months) and I would like to say how pleased I was by your presentation to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco last week.

Despite the obvious hostility you faced from some of the attendees, I felt you skillfully and professionally delivered a message that is very important for the people of California to hear.  If they listened to what you said, they should have learned a great deal and based on my listening to some of the audience during and after your presentation it seemed apparent that many of them did understand and accepted your message.

Keep voicing the same message, I know we in Government Affairs certainly will and I appreciate your support in light of the emotional environment the energy community currently finds itself operating.  I am sorry I wasn't able to meet you in our office in San Francisco prior to your address, perhaps another time. 

Kind Regards,

Dave Perrino
