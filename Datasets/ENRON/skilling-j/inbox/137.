Jeff,

It took a couple of weeks, but I found exactly what you wanted (I hope).  The CFO at Texas A&M was in administration at Michigan for about 30 yrs and had a "back door" we could go through to get the info.  

Please let me know if you find the person you're looking for - that's all Bill Krumm asked for in return.

Thanks again for spending the time at Harvard and NYU last week.  I enjoyed getting to visit with you.

Billy
