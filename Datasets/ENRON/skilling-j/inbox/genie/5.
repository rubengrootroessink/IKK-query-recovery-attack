Hi Joannie --

Carrie is an Indiana commissioner and we have invited two other Indiana commissioners.  Assuming one of her colleagues, Judith Ripley or David Zeigner accept, there is not a need to send an alternate. We appreciate the offer though.

Thanks, MSA

Mr. Skilling, 
Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in the interesting program that you are sponsoring in October.  Unfortunately, I have a conflicting commitment and will be unable to attend.  May I pass the information on to one of the other Commissioners here, or have you also invited others from our commission?
Thank you. 
Camie Swanson-Hull
