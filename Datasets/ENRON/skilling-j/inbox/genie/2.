I am a West Virginia Pjublic Service Commissioner.  I received your letter inviting me to  the Energy Policy Forum.  I have accepted and am looking forward to  participating.

I am also very much interested in being appointed to Ferc, if and when there is a vacancy.  I would appreciate any help you could give me.  Thank you. Charlotte R. Lane
