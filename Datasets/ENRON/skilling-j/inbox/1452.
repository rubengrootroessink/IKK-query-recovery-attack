Mr. Skilling,

As with the many employees here at Enron, I wish you all the best ahead. I'm sorry to hear you leave but I know you have your reasons. I'm sure
we all can respect that.

I just wanted to send you a note to say thanks again for the things you've done for me since last summer. They're greatly appreciated. Hopefully, I will have the chance to meet with you again.

Wishing you the best and hopefully I will see you again....

Kindest regards,

Tim Ng
