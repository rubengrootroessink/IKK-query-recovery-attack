Mr Skilling 
                               Team Pipeline in Bakersfield is going to be SOLD to Pacific Pipeline, and we just found out that we will be charged for the computers that we ordered.   We know that if we were to Quit or to be Fired,  We would have to pay for the computers. But we were ----SOLD---- not Fired nor did we Quit, It seems that  Team Enron Quit us! Is there anything that you can do to right this injustice?      


       Sincerely Team Pipeline
