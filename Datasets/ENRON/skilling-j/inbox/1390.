C-dog,
    The Ellen Parker shit covered blankie was ceremoniously burned in the
Elzie pit of hell on a nite when Elzie served his last offering of chicken
tetrazini.  Hillstrom and Bear Olson witnessed the burning.  I just couldn't
sleep in it anymore...I would have been up all nite from the fumes.
