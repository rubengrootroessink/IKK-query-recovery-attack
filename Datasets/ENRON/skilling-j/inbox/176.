Hello Jeff, the purpose for this message is to bring attention to
my firm, SDL International.   Big admirer of what Enron and you
 have done in the broadband sector and would like to prove the
value of my firm to Enron.   SDL is by far, one of the largest, market
leaders in the Globalization industry for Fortune 500 companies
who must have a global presence via the web to their targeted
customers.   SDL is based in the UK, (US HQ in Plano, TX), with
offices in over 26 countries and employing over 730.   We are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, been in business
for  10 years and the only vendor in this space that is profitable.

I'd like to speak with you or a direct report about the potential of
working with Enron for your globalization needs.    Certainly
you  understand the extreme difficulties and expense you may face in
maintaining consistent content and branding across your multiple,
multi-lingual websites.  SDL is a leading globalization infrastructure and
services firm that can streamline those issues while positively impacting
the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael
