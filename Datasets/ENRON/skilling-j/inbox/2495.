Space,
 
I saw my fellow Arkie, Dent, at a book  signing in downtown Houston during "The Junction Boys" tour. When are you  coming back to H-town for the new book, Jim? Can I buy you a  refreshment?
 
By the way, Dent is not the only author in our  ranks. Written under the pen name, SmackNabb, I have a Beta  big brother who is  going throughout Texas hawking his new book, "The Complete Infidel's Guide to  Radical Islam". 
 
 If your local bookstore is out of stock, buy  Dent's book.

Attached is the annual Beta Theta Pi wives  tribute to Scott McNabb held at all homecoming football games.  I am  sorry I missed this years event  but I was visiting my home state  watching Nebraska #1 beat Oklahoma #2 ...not that anyone cares.  Oh  by the way Mr. Dent is doing a great job hocking his book up here in  Oklahoma.  Yesterday I heard him on talk radio KTOK where he was signing  books and predicting Oklahoma to beat Tulsa 106 to 0.  He didn't miss it  by much.  Oh another by the way we need more Betas from the class of 73  commenting as my gag reflex is getting to much of a workout from the  class of 71. Love Space  456   I think Ulrich was 438 #1 in our  pledge class.Oh for older Oh Fos monitoring this WOOGLIN site my brother in  law John Evans Petree  # 355 had his second grandchild last month.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had  the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future  homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in  between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years  ago.
