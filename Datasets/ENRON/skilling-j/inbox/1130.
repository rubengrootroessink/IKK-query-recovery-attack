I would like to apologize for the 4 e-mail messages
you might have received this weekend.  They were
sent by a technical accident and not at my request.

The last thing I want to do is to annoy or to inconvenience
you.  If you would like to be removed from our list, PLEASE
reply to this e-mail with "remove" in the subject heading.

For anybody who is interested in our upcoming seminars in
Philadelphia and Houston, please visit:
