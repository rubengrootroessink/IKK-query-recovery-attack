Smack Nabb!!!!  It is great to see you are still alive.
As I learned that email was from you all I could hear was you
asking Elsie "gimme a little of that buck buck soup!".

HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF '73)

  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a JOKE!  I have
arranged to have the "JUNIOR COLLEGE'S" TOWER here in Austin demolished, as
it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton Museum.  The tower will
never glow orange again.  It's also on the second tier target list for the
raghead's next flyby.
Best regards.  -KAI-

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.
