Jeff,

I hope all is well with you.

Sorry I missed you in NY a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to catch up with
you. Looks and sounds like you are still doing terrific things, and I use
you and Enron a great deal in conveying my message to investors and
managers.

Al Rappaport and I have completed our book, Expectations Investing, which
will be published by Harvard Business School Press in September. (See
attached preface). I'm really excited about the product, and I think you'll
find it interesting as well.

Al and I have asked the publisher to send you a more recent version for your
review. You'll probably get it in the next week or so.

Specifically, we'd be honored if you would endorse our book. The endorsers
we are targeting are a blue chip group, and we feel your perspective would
add a great deal.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give me a shout if you have any
questions.

Michael
