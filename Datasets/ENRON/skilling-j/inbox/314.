  The eThink Team


Do you know what's included in Enron's Code of Ethics?  Do you know what policies affect corporate conduct?  Ask Sharon Butcher, Assistant General Counsel of Corporate Legal, all your questions about our corporate policies today (June 5) on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.
Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Sharon will try to answer it during her event and you can read the transcript later.


Stop what you're doing!  Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) now!  Notice anything different?
