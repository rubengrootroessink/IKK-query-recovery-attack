Votenet Brings NAFSA's National Elections Online 

Firm formally launches eBallot software and consulting practice for associations and member-based organizations 

October 26, 2001, Washington, D.C. - Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce its latest web-based software innovation, eBallot, which allows organization's members to vote online.  This easy-to-use, cost effective method of voting will change forever how private elections are conducted.  NAFSA (Association for International Educators http://www.nafsa.org) employed Votenet's technology as the sole voting mechanism during their recent 2002 national officer's election.  With 35 candidates running in twenty races internationally, NAFSA members were able to vote online for the first time in NAFSA's history.    
"As an international association with a dispersed membership, the benefits of Votenet's application are incalculable," says Denise Wold, Director of Membership Services, NAFSA, an organization of 6400 members. "The key to our success was the ease-of-use of the voting system.  Our members found the voting application to be intuitive and convenient.  Taking our election online allowed our members to view candidate profiles and vote in just a few minutes."  
Votenet's eBallot software provides: 
Convenient 24 hour a day online ballots integrated into the organization's website; 
Candidate biographies;  
Election management suite that enables election administrators to monitor voting and view real-time voting reports; 
Login security ensures one vote per eligible voter; 
Web-based application is scalable to handle any size election or referendum. 

Ideal for any organization with elected officials, Votenet's eBallot Software is not only secure, but it is easy-to-use and will aid in cutting mailing, labor, and other overhead costs involved with elections.  "Votenet's online election system saved time and money and will certainly benefit us in future election years," remarked Bill Newman, Chief Financial Officer at NAFSA.  "Any association or organization interested in slashing the financial and man-power costs associated with an election should consider working with Votenet to conduct a virtual election." 
"A large number of elections take place every year at national and international associations, businesses, charities, and unions.  Now to be able to perform that function, while also offering candidate biographies, a 'voting wizard' to aid voters, and real-time results, online is impressive. The time, trouble and cost associated with a traditional paper intensive election system makes Votenet's eBallot Software a very high ROI application for any organization with a large or geographically dispersed voting constituency," says Glen Hughlette, CEO and President of Votenet Solutions. 
The eBallot software is immediately available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by calling a sales representative at 1-800-VOTENET ext. 513
