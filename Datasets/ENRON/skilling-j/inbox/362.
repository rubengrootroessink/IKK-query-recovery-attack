FYI - Strong and colorful words  from a powerful man.

Given Lockyer's abilities,  position and and ambition, I would advise build=
ing bridges and mending fences  while this is still at the taunting stage. =
 He wants your  attention.  Knowing him, I'd say that a direct and friendly=
  call from you or Ken today, followed by a meeting would go a long  way.

MAGE]  Lockyer Fires Earthy Attack at Energy Exec     By JENIFER WARREN, Ti=
mes Staff  Writer        SACRAMENTO--In a  dramatic escalation of energy cr=
isis rhetoric, California Atty. Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the =
chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cel=
l with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is inve=
stigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale el=
ectricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Jo=
urnal that  appeared Tuesday.       "I would love to  personally escort [En=
ron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share wit=
h a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' " Lockyer said. =
      Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment "counterproductive rh=
etoric" that "does not  merit a response."       But other industry  repres=
entatives denounced the remark as "outrageous," especially because  neither=
 Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against En=
ron or other companies.       "You'd  expect that the state's chief legal c=
ounsel would file charges first and  make public statements second," said G=
ary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy =
producers and traders. "We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, =
which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office."       In an interview =
Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to "ratchet up" the commentary to "put [e=
nergy  companies] on notice" that "we are not afraid of them and have the w=
ill to  prosecute."       "What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buc=
caneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted,"=
 Lockyer said. "Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corpora=
tions, it doesn't provide them with  immunity."       The attorney general =
is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits=
  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  S=
everal panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Publi=
c Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, L=
ockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over docum=
ents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went=
 to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a Mar=
ch 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  docu=
ments would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in s=
earch of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws=
.       "Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity,"=
 Lockyer said. "But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough =
that you can convince a jury."        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  =
chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader. =
       At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid.=
 Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, "Let Lockyer be=
 Lockyer."  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this s=
