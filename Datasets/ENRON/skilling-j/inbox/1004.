Just wanted to let you guys know that Geoff unsubscribed from our
Betas yahoogroup today. He did not re-subscribe with another email
address.  I'm only speculating now, but his email address was with
TWA and we know that TWA was acquired by American Airlines, and the
airlines are a mess right now.  So, if you know of any other contact
addresses with Geoff, get in touch with him and let us know how we
can keep him in the loop. Geoff spent many years in the USAF, so
hopefully he's not heading into some covert operation in Afghanistan.

stay in touch with the brothers.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
