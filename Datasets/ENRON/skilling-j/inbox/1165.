All,
Attached is a brief recap of yesterday's Angel
breakfast at the Houstonian.
We had 4 companies present for 10 minutes each. Those
companies, along with information about their
pre-scheduled follow up meetings is listed below:
**Fiber Dynamics: 9/25, 9:00 AM, 
Mike Burke email: mdburkesa@aol.com 
**IP2M: 10/2, 4:00 PM, 
Ariel Leibovitz email: ariel@pdq.net
**Meetrix: 9/26, 10:00 AM, 
Kerry Brooks email: kbrooks@eyesoftexaspartners.com
**NeoSurg: 9/28, 4:00 PM, 
Bryan Emerson email: emersonb@starlightcapital.com
If you were not able to make the breakfast, but are
interested in attending a follow up meeting, please
contact the Angel "advocate" directly. Please make
sure to contact the advocate, so that if there are  any
changes to the meeting schedule, he will know to
inform you.
We also had the CEO's of two companies, IDev
Technologies and Rotary Steerable Tools, give updates
on the recent developments at their companies. If you
would like more information on follow up meetings  with
either of those two companies, please contact me
directly, and I will put you in touch with the  correct
Angel advocate.
We spent roughly 30 minutes discussing administrative
issues concerning the new structure of HAN. I have
attached a copy of that Powerpoint presentation for
your review.
Please do not hesitate to contact either Michelle
Weisblatt at (713) 533-9986 or Kerry Brooks at (713)
462-5565, with any question, comments, or  suggestions.
Thank you.
Michelle Weisblatt
