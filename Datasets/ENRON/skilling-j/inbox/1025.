    Thursday, October 04, 2001 Issue 38   EDITORIAL  A Focus on the latest =
developments in Europe Today's briefing takes a look at what's going on in =
the European energy marketplace.  It's been an interesting year...deregulat=
ion, new regulation on renewables, the IPE bought out by the ICE, American =
energy companies staking their claims and European companies crossing the p=
ond.  With all the articles written about California's failed experiment wi=
th deregulation, little attention has been focused on how the European coun=
tries have faired in their move to more deregulated markets.  And just like=
 in the US, the changes in the European market offer a number of opportunit=
ies for companies providing new developments in billing and CRM software, t=
rading solutions, and communications.  Two articles below take a look at th=
e state of play in Europe. This also gives us the opportunity to announce o=
ur new European conferences.  We'll be bringing the successful Energy Excha=
nges Online event over to Europe, as well as co-locating it with 2 other ev=
ents:  Weather Trading 2002  and Emissions Trading 2002 , to provide delega=

nd increased competition.  It is a harsh environment for an industry accust=
omed to operating in an inflexible, monopolistic manner. The information ag=

really no such thing as deregulation. There is simply the re-regulation of =
