I'm sure you probably won't hear any crude jokes at  your expense having to do with one hand, applying too much pressure, etc. This  group is too sensitive and caring for that. On the flip side, you won't have to  shovel any snow for six weeks....and I understand there's an inch down  in  Southern VT as we speak.

I forgot George was you LITTLE brother with a  higher roll #. Since we now know that Smack-Nabb / Donkey was #457 , George was  # 462 , Space #456, Strap Anderson #455, Rag-Man Stewart #454, who was  #458,#459, #461 ? Or more likely, who cares ?

HAPPY HOLLOWEEN  FROM SAMURAIMAI  (#457 CLASS OF  '73)                          
  Regarding U T winning the national championship.  What a  JOKE!  I have 
arranged to have the "JUNIOR COLLEGE'S" TOWER here in  Austin demolished, as 
it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton  Museum.  The tower will 
never glow orange again.  It's also on  the second tier target list for the 
raghead's next flyby.
Best  regards.  -KAI-
At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had  the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future  homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in  between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years  ago.
