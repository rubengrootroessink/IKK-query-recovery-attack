Be sure to stop at the Enron stake-out in Bellville for our specially catered lunch.  

Sarita Garza and her crack team of volunteers will be there at dawn to save a spot.    They will hand out a special surprise to celebrate your arrival at the mid-point of the first day's journey.

When you pull off the highway into the Bellville Park, watch for the Enron signs to direct you to our picnic area. 

 Happy Pedaling!   Amelia
