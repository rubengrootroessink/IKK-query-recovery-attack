Have received a draw request on the above and have ordered the inspection, however, we will need the following items prior to funding:
Borrowers signature on the 3 page draw request 
Borrowers signature on the Contractors Disbursement Disclosure 
Borrowers signature on Change order #26 
Please forward to my attention. 
Thanks!
