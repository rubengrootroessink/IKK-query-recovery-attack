Admittedly the BCS rankings for top eWooglin.com is doing the tighten up
(remember when we had Archie Bell and Drells at a Beta party?).
But I can't let this one go.  According to the SMU 73 yearbook, Doug Dyer
was in your freshman class and in your pledge class.  Not that the SMU
yearbook is a definitive archival record.  But you may have been referring
to Doug Denham class of 73. I say no more.
