Jeff,
Now that the dust has started to settled (only slightly), I just want to
write this note to wish you well.
There are times when looking out for #1 is of paramount importance.
While we are not in touch with one another to any great extent, I do
empathize with you on the strains that you must have encountered over the
last few years! Actually, I probably have no conception of the strain and
pressure!  Nonetheless, I hope we can remain in touch. To the extent that
can help in any way (and I don't mean to be presumptuous), I would be
delighted to do so.
Best regards,

David.

David C. Morris
Sr. VP Lehman Brothers
