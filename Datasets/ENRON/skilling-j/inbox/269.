Jeff,

Sorry for the original e-mail below.

A Portuguese speaker sending e-mails in English where he should not.

He has been terminated (for reasons unrelated to the e-mail) and I consider the issue closed.

If any doubts please do not hesitate to call.

Thanks,

Kish

Attached is the email from Jorge.  We are in the process of terminating Jorge due to performance and relation issues.  We are doing this immediately due to the nature of Jorge's job, although we were trying to delay until the replacement was in place.  Given recent actions (not the email below), we have decided to move forward with the termination this afternoon.
