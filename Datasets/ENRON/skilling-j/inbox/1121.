Dear Doctor Pecker Checker,
     All things considered equal, had I the choice between a cardiologist
running a catheter up to my heart via an artery in my upper leg or you
running one of the same up Captain Stubby's drain pipe, I would opt for the
former.  What say ye men?

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
