Shacklepuss,
     Yet another EWooglin.com recruit!!  I don't even remember how I signed
up on this deal, much less how to tell Joe Parks.  Can you email him please
and give him the instructions?   Thanks Shack.

-kai-,
Drow

Drow,  We had a great time last weekend.  It was good to see Jones & Roby -
they have aged well.  My family and I really appreciate all the work you &
the Redhead did to make it happen.
Tell me how to get on the Beta website and get on the e-mail list.  Hope the
Good Wood project is moving forward; I know the various gov agencies will be
really cooperative!
Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you guys soon.
Yours in -kai-
Joe

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
