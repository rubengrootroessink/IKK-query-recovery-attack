In case y'all have not heard, Jeff resigned unexpectedly from Enron yesterday, siting "personal family commitments" or something like that.  I though y'all would like to know.

Beek,  thanks for the update.  There will be a little more -kai- in Atlanta this weekend as Woody Berry, Adam Berry, maybe Joe Berry join John Grumbles, Mark Hillstrom and his son Ryan, for some sort of golf tournament (I really think it's all about the beer and the -kia-!!).  
  
Chuck 
  
My hats off to Jeff Skilling for his amazing talents at Enron over the past several years!
