Joannie:

As I mentioned, Jerry is in transit in Europe at the moment, and it will be
extremely difficult for me to get hold of him again today to reschedule.
Given the time difference involved I will not be able to contact him before
the appointed time tomorrow, and therefore I'd very much appreciate if we
could go ahead with the call as planned.  At least that way Mr. Skilling can
decide which of the dinners he would prefer to attend, I assume that the
more notice you have the better.

Erica,

Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it
would be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.

Thanks,

Subject:  Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock


Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.
