Mr Skilling,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the last Executive Forum. It was very informative.  And it helped me 
to understand some of the corporate goals and issues more clearly. 

As I mentioned in that meeting,  I think the Xcelerator can be a key tool for leveraging our "soft" assets, as well 
as helping Enron develop new business models to lead it into the future.  I also think the Xcelerator
can play a key role in creating a balance between technology and commercial realities.  

---

To succeed in these goals,  it's obvious that the Xcelerator needs a very dynamic, strong leadership.  

I understand that a new COO has been hired and starts next week.  I think that this is a great way to introduce a good 
process & structure to the Xcelerator quickly.

I also understand that you're looking for a CEO from within Enron.  I just learned this morning that John Echols
is moving out of EBS.  I believe that John would be a fantastic person to lead the Xcelerator.  John is an extremely 
bright and creative  person, who first visualizes the overall business model, and then works dilligently to achieve it.
John is well respected within Enron, and is viewed by everyone as a "neutral".  He would give the Xcelerator
the internal credibility it needs to succeed.

I'm excited about the opportunity of working with the Xcelerator regardless of who becomes the CEO.
I think it will become a great asset to Enron.


Thanks again for your time.
