Ken and Jeff:

As you know, last year Enron produced its first ever EHS annual report with some mentions of our new Corporate Responsibility program.  We are producing this year's version, which is expanded both in the environmental reporting as well as our human rights and social initiatives covered.  Mike Terraso and I would like to include an opening letter by the two of you (last year Ken signed it).  Will you please review the attached and edit, comment or approve by next week?  We appreciate your help with this.
