Snaps to Beek, Zebes!

Where is Salvaggio, Rene Molina, has anybody heard from these people?

God, there's nothing better than to here the Z-man go after Beek.  Even if it is E-abuse, I can still almost hear the teeth squeeking and pots crashing in the kitchen, ah, the smell of near rancid bacon and of course Elsie's never-fail (send-you-upstairs-flyin') p-cakes.  Oh, to be regular again.  Zebes, bring your guitar to Dallas next time, please.


#520 and I hope to be a better one.

>OK, if you didn't hurt your hand pleasuring yourself please come up with a scenario that's more plausible.Such as, falling off a three story barn and breaking your fall with your hand OR saving an infant who had crawled onto train tracks and having to stop the oncoming train with one mighty paw. Yeah, that sounds better...plus the train was headed over a washed out bridge.....and you saved everybody on the train also.......yeah...now we're getting to the truth.  Or you could actually come clean and admit that you hit your own hand with a hammer.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
