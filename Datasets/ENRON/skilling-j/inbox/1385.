Brother Beta's:  Last night we had a GREAT Beta gathering here in Atlanta.
The pictures were taken at John Miller's house.  In attendance:   Beta's
John Miller, Randall Harman, John Grumbles, and Mark Hillstrom and myself.
We also had Rita Harman and their two kids, Meredith and Kyle, Woody's 2
sons, Matt and Adam, as well as Mark Hillstrom's son, Ryan. Mark's son was
in Atlanta to play in the U.S. Amateur golf championship.

We feasted on Woody's great ribs and his Awesome Woody Blossom and drank a
few too many beers (you can't see us singing in a couple of the pictures but
we did!!)  Foosball was one of the activities, as was a phone call to Phil
and Annie Morrow in Rockford, Il.  The picture of John Miller is NOT with
his wife, April; it's with Randall Harman's daughter, Meredith.

Some things never change (thank God and Wooglin), enjoy the pics,

-kai-

Chuck

P.S.  Homecoming is the weekend of October 27th-be there!  Beta tailgating
on campus-what could be better!!
