Dinner in LaGrange will be a great affair.  Randy Gross of the Enron Aviation Department will again provide us with his fabulous barbecued brisket and sausage.  The Marriott will be there with some great side dishes and some chicken thing that I know will be wonderful as well.

J. Paul Oxer is once again Camp Director and has some great improvements to the 2001 tent.  Heather Choate is the Volunteer Coordinator for the 65 operations volunteers in Bellville, LaGrange and Austin.  Thanks to all!

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS DINNER IS PROVIDED FOR ENRON RIDERS AND QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS ONLY.  Many of you have family and friends gathering in LaGrange with you, and they are welcome to visit us in the tent, but we can't feed them.  We will need to strictly guard against the possibility of running out of food before the last rider comes in.  As a means to control this, if you are not wearing an Enron cycling jersey or an Enron Cycling Club volunteer t-shirt, your name will be checked on a master list before you are invited to participate in the dinner.  Since all our volunteers do not know you, please don't be offended when they check the list for your name if you are not wearing an Enron jersey.

PLEASE DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS.  IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE INHOSPITABLE, IT'S THAT WE ARE IN A REMOTE LOCATION WHERE REPLENISHMENT OF OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND WE DO NOT WANT TO TURN A TIRED, HUNGRY RIDER OR VOLUNTEER AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

THERE IS FOOD AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THROUGH THE MAIN DINING PROVIDED BY THE MS SOCIETY, AND YOU CAN GET THE LOCATION FROM OUR INFORMATION BOOTH IN THE TENT.  THE CHARGE IS $5 FOR DINNER, AND $3 FOR BREAKFAST FOR NON-RIDERS.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION !!
