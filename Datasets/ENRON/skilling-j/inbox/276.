I want to ask a question for e:speak today but I don't want my name put on the question.

There are some internet gurus working on e:mail from Mars.  I would like to know if Enron has plans on getting involved in  interplanetary communication.

Tomorrow will be here faster than you think!

Thank you for your valued and important time and my privacy.

Diana
