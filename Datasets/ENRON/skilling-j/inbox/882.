Hess,  I vaguely remember Gary Vale and concur with your sentiments.  I also
appreciate your words and thoughts on the Sept 11th tragedy.  It has changed
us all for a very long time to come.  I am not looking forward to my first
flight since Sept 11th tonight to Dallas.  The good of all of this (if there
is such a thing) is that it has brought this country closer than it's been
since WWII.  There's always a silver lining, sometimes just hard to find.

Chuck

Dear Beta Bros,

     I fully intended to respond to Woody's e-mail and forward about
President Bush much more quickly than this.  I noticed that there was no
response out there when Woody posted this and I didn't want him to
feel so lonely, so here goes... (warning: this is not lighthearted fare!)
     I'm sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since
September 11th.  That day was a vivid reminder that I don't have a choice in
determining how or when I'm going to die (barring suicide of course), but I
do have a choice about how I'm going to live.  September 11th and the events
which continue to unfold have caused me to focus a whole lot more on what's
truly important in life- family, relationships, faith.
     Believing that those terrorists were willing to die for a lie, I've
been forced to ask myself- what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe
is the TRUTH?
     For many of you guys, I confess, I failed to personally share what I
believed was the truth, even back in college.  I was not willing to
sacrifice acceptance- a hard thing for a college kid to give up. Forgive me
for that.
     [Unbelievably, just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted
by a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you
may have known. He was a football player and on my freshman floor at SMU.  I
wish I had room to tell you Gary's whole story.  In short, we were friends,
I watched him begin trashing his life in the Spring semester but failed to
try to help much.  Gary became an alcoholic, just sobering up three years
ago.  But, too late to recover from damage that had been done.  He walked
into my life again two months ago when, through a series of "coincidences,"
he ended up at our church.  His father just called to tell me that Gary died
last night.  I can't help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided
had I done more in the Spring of '72? So, it's now with grief and an even
greater sense of urgency that I write this today.]
     If recent events have moved you to a place of searching and seeking,
please read on and allow me a few moments of your time to share what I've
experienced as real truth about real life.
     I've found the evidence to be very compelling that this planet and all
it contains (including us), is the design of a very imaginative Creator.
That Creator is not an impersonal force, or removed and simply "watching us
from a distance." He is a personal being who knows His creation and
desperately desires to be known by them.  He so much desires to be known by
us that, in a manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to
face, He became a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
     Some think perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet.
However, I realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not
accept that.  Jesus claimed to be God; and he claimed to hold the key to
people's eternal destiny.  Jesus'claims left only three options.  He was
either a liar (the worst kind because he deceived people about their
eternity), a lunatic, or, he was who he said he was- he was Lord.
     Could God love me that much, to go that far?  To allow His own Son to
come and show us and teach us what God is like? To die on a cross to pay the
penalty of my sin and obtain my forgiveness? To rise from the dead to secure
the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God both now and
forever?
     Personally, I've found all of the above to be true.  God is a personal
God.  Jesus is Lord.  And, God does love me that much- to suffer the death
of His own Son in order to offer real life (now and forever) to me and
anyone else who is willing to do just one thing...  receive that gift; just
accept Him.
     A number of years ago I did accept Him.  And, in doing that, I've
experienced everything He said to be true.  Life has not been problem-free.
That's not what He promised, in fact, Jesus assured us that we will have
problems in this life.  But, He has always personally been there. He has
always given His strength, wisdom, guidance, peace, contentment, patience,
encouragement, hope, and love. [These Scriptures tell about it: John 3:16,
Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 13, and many more]
     As Woody's e-mail stated, it is encouraging to know where this
President is turning at such a time as this.  Thank God that's a personal
relationship that's offered to anyone who seeks it, not just the big boys.
Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these thoughts.
      If you'd like to talk more about this, I'd love to do so.  My phone
number is 918-743-8897 (office), 918-298-6144 (home) and my e-mail addresses
are pastorhess@hotmail.com,or, hess@shbc-tulsa.org.  I wish I could be at
more of the gatherings, but weekends are a tough time to get away in this
business!  May God bless you all.

-kai-

Hess Hester
