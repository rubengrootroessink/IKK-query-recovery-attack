Jeff,

If what I hear is true about your retirement, let me
be one of the first to offer heartfelt
congratulations. I've never quite understood people
that basically work right up to the grave. It always
seemed to me (and now I'm finding out its true) that
there are just way too many things to do, books to
read, people to meet, places to go, etc., etc., to
work 80 hour weeks for 50 years.

When I first read about it, I thought that maybe you
and Rebecca had flipped a coin and she lost. (She had
told me that if the two of you got engaged, one of you
would have to quit.)

If you really are planning to retire, let me offer
some advice. On my odyssey I've noticed a couple of
humps I had to get over. The first one hit me at about
ten days. All of a sudden I had the stupid impression
that I should find something constructive to do. After
a couple of days, the feeling went away. However it
did come back at about the 4 week mark. Once again, I
was able to come to my senses. I think I may have
permanently suppressed the feeling at this point.

Unfortunately, now that I really do have to go back to
work, I can't seem to get too motivated. Oh well,
maybe, if nothing else, I have learned not to work 80
hour weeks ever again.

Best of luck and tell my sister hi.


Steve


P.S. I have sketched you a raised timber platform,
with a small cabin in the center (for those that think
they need indoor plumbing, etc.) If you find a place
to put it, I want to build it.

P.P.S. I just finished the first two volumes of Caro's
L.B.J. biography. Extremely interesting if you're
looking for reading mat'l.
