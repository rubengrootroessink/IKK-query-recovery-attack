I just found a lost BETA living in my backyard in  Edmond Oklahoma.
It seems that Steven M Ellsworth has been an Okie since  1996. I spoke with him this morning and he would like to get together  with fellow OK BETAS for some -KAI-.
 
So I am proposing a 2001 SPACE Odyssee  -KAI-fest   on or about September 8th at my house. 
 
I am located just off the turnpike that runs between Oklahoma  City and Tulsa.  Thats an hour and a half drive from Tulsa.  I am 20  minutes from Nichols Hills and Quail Creek.  I figure there are at least 10  of you out there.
