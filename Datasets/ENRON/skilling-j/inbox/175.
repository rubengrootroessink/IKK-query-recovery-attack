If you decide to use this in press materials, please use the following verbiage in reference to Red Herring: 
"Presenting the most important private and public companies in the world: companies that, despite the downturn, are either disrupting existing markets or creating new ones altogether. Each year since 1997, Red Herring editors select 100 public and private companies they see as the brightest stars in the business universe: the companies whose products, services, and business models define business innovation. The Red Herring 100 represents the future - the latest trends, the hottest sectors, the leading markets. It predicts the definitive companies, the leaders of tomorrow." 
Again, we congratulate you and wish you success in your company's future endeavors. 
Sincerely, 
Red Herring Edit Staff
