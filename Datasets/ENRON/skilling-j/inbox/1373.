Jeff,
Like many, I was surprised to hear of your decision.  I know that it is a
very difficult time in the business environment, but I hope that things are
okay with you personally.  Once the dust settles and you get a chance to
decompress some, I'd enjoy getting together with you to catch up.

Let me know if there is anything Sallie and I can do.

Best regards,
Marvin
