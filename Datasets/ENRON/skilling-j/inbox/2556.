Brother Shackleton, it's your kind of thinking that lead to this discussion.
You know damn well the THE REASON that the Black fraternity with no white
members exists on the Auburn campus is because there are none of the Miami
Triad members or any other national fraternities on that campus who pledge
Blacks.  So, don't be so stupid with your inane comment about the fact that
the Black fraternity has no "white guys" as members.  Before you stepped
foot on the campus at SMU, there was an occasion when there was a very sharp
Black guy who registered for and came through rush.  Surprisingly, there
were several of us (including yours truly - an original New Orleans biggot
of the highest magnitude) who really were impressed with the guy and thought
we should invite him back for the house party.  I remember vividly the
incredible outlash when we stood before our brothers and tried to convince
them to ignore the fact that this guy was Black.  We got hooted down and he
was BALLED!  And, I have no doubts after reading your immature remark that
the same would have taken place during your tenure as an active at Gamma
Omega.  So, get a life, Ace.  It's 2001 and counting.  How many Black
brothers can you name from Gamma Omega?
