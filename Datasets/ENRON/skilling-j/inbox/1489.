Dear Jeff:
> The editing process has been completed on your Batten Dinner keynote
> speech and your interview with me, Professors Bodily, Liedtka, and
> Teisberg. I am delighted to announce that both are now available for
> viewing on the Batten web site.  The finished product is impressive, and I
> think you will be happy with it.  Please take a look at:
> http://www.darden.virginia.edu/batten/index.htm.
>
> This web cast is the first in Batten's Electronic Series on Leadership and
> Transformation.  It is the Institute's intent to produce these web casts
> on an on-going basis as a means of creating permanent "footprints" from
> all of its research and educational programs.  Batten hopes that they will
> serve both as additional intellectual resources within the School and as
> reflections of Darden's research activity externally.  As part of our
> mission to "foster pioneering thought and practice for creating, leading,
> and transforming business enterprise," we have shared this web cast with
> the Darden community and will forward it to Darden alumni and friends of
> the School in the next week.  It is our hope that you have an audience
> that you would like to share the site with, also.
>
> Jeff, again I extend my thanks to you for generating the content for this
> web cast and for sharing your valuable time with us. Compliments are still
> coming in about the elegant and stimulating evening of May 25th. My
> appreciation also goes to Christie Patrick, Ursula Brenner, Hamd Alkhayat,
> Sherri Sera, Joannie Williamson, Melinda McCarty, and Karen Marshall who
> all made special efforts to arrange for your visit to Charlottesville.
>
> Cheers,
>
> Bob
