Don of the Dels, 
You had better put on your fire resistant suit, Del, as I think it is still  
on fire!  I think one of the boys left a fat one smoking up there.  Maybe  
Drow could drop trow over the burning roof and let go with a flutter blast or  
a three point freep and put out the blaze. Lord Windasmere to the rescue!  Oh  
he shits!  The champion is disqualified! 
See you in Norman on the 24th.  Tell Joe Don Looney to be there, in drag or  
normal clothes.  OU Sooners...13 in a row and only 35 more to go to break the  
record and give Dent a reason to write another book!
