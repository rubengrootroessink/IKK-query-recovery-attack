Hey Bill Miller:

You stupid asshole. Doug Dyer was not in our class. I will admit that Mule
Benson showed some guts in standing up for your wimp class. You obviously
don't have the guts. You live two blocks from me and never even had the
grace to say hello. So stick it, brother. Wish I could take you back to the
dorg.

Dent
