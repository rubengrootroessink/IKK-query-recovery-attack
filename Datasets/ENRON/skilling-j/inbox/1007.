Brother Betas,

I am George Pereira from the graduating class of 2001. Justin told me of the
Beta group and I was so impressed that you have stayed in contact for all
this time that I wanted to join. I'm now working in Houston where there is a
nice conglomeration of recently graduated SMU Betas. Do you'll have anything
planned for Homecoming? I remember last year that there was a big Beta tent.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
