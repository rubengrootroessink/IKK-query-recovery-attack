During our United Way 2000 Campaign that was held last fall, you were kind enough to pledge a contribution to the United Way. Our records indicate that your preference was to pay by check.  If you have already paid your contribution, thank you!  If you have not, we wanted to provide you with the information that you need in order to send in your contribution.

All checks should be made out to the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast.  They can be sent interoffice mail in a confidential envelope to the attention of Zulie Flores, EB 1612.  If for some reason, you do not know the amount that you pledged, you can call Zulie at 
3-3908 and she will be able to assist you.

We had such a successful campaign last year and it was due in large part to your generosity.  Thank you for your support of this very important program - you did make a difference!
