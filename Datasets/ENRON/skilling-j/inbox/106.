Dear Jeff:
 
We met at the World Economic Forum several weeks ago,  discussing Enron's interest in emissions trading, both SO2 and eventually CO2, a  subject in which I am engaged with other energy firms. I didn't get a chance to  mention that I've followed Indian energy since my posting as economic counselor  at the Delhi embassy in the mid-90's; I knew Joe Sutton quite well, as well as  many of your other folks. 
 
The news today about all the political maneuvering in regard  to Dabhol reminded me that I had wanted to offer my sympathetic and reasonably  knowledgeable support as you and your team cope with the issues, including  conciliation and a possible renegotiation. You have no scarcity of people on  this thorny subject, but I do have both a decade's perspective and excellent  current access to decisionmakers out there.
 
Regards
