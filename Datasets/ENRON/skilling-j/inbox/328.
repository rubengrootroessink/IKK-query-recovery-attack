    Thursday, May 31, 2001 Issue 29   EDITORIAL  Today and Tomorrow-what As=
ia faces and what we've all learned from the past  As you probably know, th=
e Eyeforenergy team is off to Mexico next week for our Latin American e-bus=
iness in energy conference.  But to prove that our interests are global, ou=
r Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Li=
ke their colleagues in Latin America, Europe and North America, energy exec=
utives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes,=
 and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of=
 these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting pict=
ure of the state of play in Asia today and what sort of challenges they fac=
e tomorrow.   In other news, the move towards online trading continues apac=
e in the energy industry (unlike recent developments in most other industri=
es) with announcements by Pantellos and Duke Energy North America.  Pantell=
os' move into the international arena with its procurement solution points =
towards the increasing use of online marketplaces in the energy supply chai=
n (or at least a refusal to give up in the wake of Petrocosm's demise).    =
  While Duke's announcement of their move to OpenLink's software points tow=
ards the increasing use of Internet technology on the commodity side of ene=
rgy trading.   Either way, the energy sector seems to be one of the few bri=
ght spots in the wake of the dot com gloom. The energy industry's measured =
response and refusal to jump on the e-commerce bandwagon at the start seems=
 to be proving dividends now.  Perhaps the rest of the new economy is learn=
ing what it seemed that the energy industry always knew-the Internet is jus=
