Just wanted to let you all know that the following media outlets were at the press conference this morning:
Channel 2
Channel 45
Channel 48
KUHF radio (NPR)

The Houston Business Journal picked up the story and is currently running it on its home page (it will appear in print this Friday). 

Channel 26 plans on coming out to the awards celebration tomorrow night. The Chronicle and several other local papers are also working on stories.
