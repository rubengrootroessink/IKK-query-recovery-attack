Dear Jeffrey,
The tragic events of September 11th have had a profound and lasting impact on all of us
in the Red Herring community - corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, technologists and
venture capitalists. From October 28th to 30th at Red Herring's annual NDA
conference, we plan to get back to business. Our speakers and presenting companies
will debate the technology trends that will change the future of business and discuss the
methods successful companies have used to innovate in a difficult market. In addition,
Red Herring will use NDA to raise funds for the victims of the September 11th tragedy.
Red Herring has organized several charitable activities for the two-day conference and
will donate $100 for each registered participant to a fund to help victims in New York and
Washington, D.C.
This year's NDA will take  Red Herring's predictive look at the biggest ideas still to come
over the next 12 to 18 months.
Presenters include:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mike Homer, former head of marketing at Netscape and current founder and CEO of wireless startup Kontiki;
John Seeley Brown, chief innovation officer, 1 2 Entrepreneuring;
Dr. Paul Jacobs, Executive Vice President, Qualcomm;
Dr. Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO, Google;
Dave House, CEO and Chairman, Allegro Networks;
Roger McNamee, Co-founder and General Partner, Integral Capital Partners;
Paul Deniger, Chairman and CEO, Broadview;
Esther Dyson, founder, Edventure Holdings;
Steve Jurvetson and Tim Draper, managing partners with Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
Join Red Herring and the a-list of NDA speakers as we:
* Debate and discuss the trends and opportunities that will define business innovation
in the year to come
* Provide invaluable insight and tools you need to innovate out of a market cycle  -
straight from the front lines of emerging startups and corporate R?labs
* Get a first hand look at young, emerging companies promising to define the future of
the biotech, storage, software, wireless, optics, nanotechnology and Internet
infrastructure sectors
* Explore real-life case studies and business solutions that have succeeded and failed
in the current marketplace
We hope you will join us for a unique thought-leadership conference that will peer into
the current market and explore the trends and opportunities that will drive the
continuing wave of business innovation.
