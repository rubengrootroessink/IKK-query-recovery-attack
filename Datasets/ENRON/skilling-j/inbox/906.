2001 Moonlight Bicycle Ramble - Oct 28th, 2AM
This is a very important ride and supports our own Houston Area Bicyclist Alliance which is an organization that is working to make Houston a better place for cycling. For more info please see their website at: <http://www.bikehouston.org> 
Registration form: <http://www.bikehouston.org/ramble/ramblebro2001v2.pdf> 
If you have problems opening the registration file it is most probably due to not having Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your computer - please choose one of the two steps that I outlined below:

1. Go to <http://www.adobe.com/acrobat> and download Adobe Acrobat Reader - its free.
Here is the exact Link: <http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html>

2. There is a plain text registration form available on the Web Page at the following Link:
