Good Afternoon, Mr. Skilling.

I just heard of your resignation. I wanted to personally "Thank You" for being such a positive influence for ALL the employees of Enron. You have always carried yourself as "Enron" and have helped placing a positive knowledge to the community of what Enron and its employee's truly are.

 I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and in life in general. I am deeply saddened by this news that you are leaving, but can not help but feel happy for you. (as this was your decision)

May God Bless you.

Best Regards,
Rachel Peckenpaugh
