Dick,  sorry we didn't not connect but I WAS there for the game and even
went to the Beta house an hour or so after the game.  I ran into Margo and
Harry Johnson on campus Friday.

Hope you are well-check out our website below-picture included!  Tell
Folladore Hi if/when you see him.

Chuck

Where the Hell were you guys last weekend?!  Of course, I saw only 2 of my
pledge brothers (Class of '69).  But, I saw a bunch of the brothers from the
class of '71 (whose 30th Reunion it was - mine was 2 years ago!).  I was
hoping to meet some of you jackoff idiots who I didn't know.  I thought
Chuck Paul was going to be there, but if he was I didn't get to renew -
kai -.

Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finally
met a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a book
signing before the A@M/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of "The
Junction Boys" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We had
a nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70's when
you were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass off
over in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a business
card, and I've been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitous
occasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you'll acept this - my
apology for not contacting you before now.  I've actually thought about it
several times before now.

So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes just
after mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys before
me haven't found it appropriate to write on this Board), I'm quite impressed
to see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -
just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of
'71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven't seen in over 25+ years -
and we picked up as if there hadn't been any time that elapsed between.
Damn, it's great to be a BETA!

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.
