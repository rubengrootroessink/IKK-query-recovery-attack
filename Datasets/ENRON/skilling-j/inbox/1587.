Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling:

I just wanted to thank you and express my appreciation for the $1000 given to flood victims of Tropical Storm Allison.  It is unsolicited actions such as this that set Enron apart and make it the leading company in the Houston community.  Thanks again.  

Sincerely,
Michael Flanigan
