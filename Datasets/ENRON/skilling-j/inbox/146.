Respected Sirs:

This is Xafira Mendonsa, one of the nominees to your round table held on November 14, 2000. 

Just felt like writing these few lines telling you that - It was great being with you in Houston. Thanks so much for giving us the chance to work for your Company in India. It is really very depressing to see things going bad, but I love and treasure Enron very much and along with Enron you will always be remembered by each one of us. I have worked for this Company for 7 long years and it has been a home for me and for my family as my husband and son also work in the same project. How I wish this project would go on and on and I could retire in the same company.  

Unfortunately things are not rosy here anymore. However, I am opted to accept new challenges and jobs across the Enron Corp. world-wide - if given an opportunity. Here in Mumbai, I have been recently promoted from an Executibe Secretary to an Administration Officer. I request you to keep me in mind and give me a chance to serve the Company anywere outside India.

Once again, I thank Enron for treating its employees so well and making us all feel important and wanted. I am proud to be associated with Enron and it is for that reason that I want to work for you till I retire.

Do consider my humble request and will be anxiously waiting for a reply. Greetings and many thanks from India.

Best regards with Blessings from the Almightly,
Xafira
