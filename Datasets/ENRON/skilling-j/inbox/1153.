Association, will dedicate the proceeds from its upcoming annual golf
tournament on September 26 to the American Red Cross to assist with the
relief efforts in New York and Washington, DC.

In the midst of these unique and tragic times, rather than cancel this
event, Texas eComm hopes that this event will be not only a gathering of our
community but also a fundraiser and catalyst to the relief efforts that are
underway and a recognition of the losses that we have all endured both
