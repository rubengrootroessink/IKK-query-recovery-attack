Dear Mr Skilling,

As conference director for Global IP Carriers 2002, I would like to speak to
you to discuss the focus of next year's conference programme and to discuss
speaking opportunities at the event. It is a well established event for IP
wholesale and IP carriers infrastructure market and I would expect 100+
delegates for next year's conference. A tightly focused programme is most
crucial at this stage and this is the initial reason for contacting you as a
player within the marketplace.

IP networks are capable of delivering cost control and new revenues to
carriers. Internet traffic will grow, albeit not as fast as previously
predicted and we are moving towards all IP networks, certainly for the new
carriers. The areas that I would like to discuss with you cover a broad
range and if you would like to respond only on certain topics that is fine -
all feedback is invaluable for focusing the programme. The broad areas to be
covered include -

Quality of service - what architectures deliver? MPLS vs Diffserv? Gigabit
Ethernet vs ATM?
Service provisioning - areas of growth for service providers and will there
be self provisioning?
What methods of diffentiation are IP carriers at the edge of the network?
Bundling of services - challenges and opportunities
Customer loyalty and churn - strategies for building customer bases and CRM
Areas for revenue growth - value added services that will grow your revenue
IP VPNs - are they the killer app that will encourage enterprises to pay for
new fiber?
VoIP - predictions for uptake and challenges
IP Telephony - economies of scale for new carriers? implications for margins
of incumbents?
Access technologies - what is happening in the IP local loop
How softswitching is going to impact costs and its real advantages
Billing - IP Interconnect and implications for service provisioning
Costs of OSS and business support systems
What enterprise case studies you would like to hear about and what industry
sectors are the most relevant to you?

The delegate profile for the event will be CEOs, CFOs, Strategy & Planning
Directors, International Network Directors, Sales Directors, Marketing
Directors, Business Development Directors, CTOs, IT Directors, Network
Architects and MDs of the following markets -

IP Carriers
ISPs
Bandwidth Exchanges
Optical networking equipment vendors
Consultants
Systems integrators
Billing vendors
OSS suppliers

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above topics with you and any
other topics you may feel should be included in the programme. If you would
like to hear from particular speakers also, please let me know and I will
endeavour to invite them to participate. There are speaking opportunities on
the programme as it is very much in its nascent stages and when I have a
draft programme written I would like to discuss participation with you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon as I am on a tight deadline as
always and ideally would like to speak to you for a short time sometime this
week.

Kind regards
Noreen Meehan
