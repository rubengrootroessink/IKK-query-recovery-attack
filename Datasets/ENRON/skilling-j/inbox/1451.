Jeff:

I was actually on the phone with my Dad when I received Kenneth Lay's email about your departure, we both wish you luck and hope that everything is ok.  I have been working here as a consultant for the past month or two and have to say that I really enjoy the Enron environment, culture, and company that you helped build.  It really is an incredible place.

Regardless, I currently live in Austin and work here during the weeks.  If you ever get a chance, I'd love to hear from you sometime.  You can always email me here or my other address (wcarberry@sensecorp.com) or call me at 512-791-4709.

My Mom, Dad and I have always admired your successes and I still remember when we went tubing right after you decided to leave a sure thing at McKinsey to take a chance at this new merger-created company called Enron - what an amazing ride.  We do wish you well going forward.

Sincerely,
Wes Carberry
