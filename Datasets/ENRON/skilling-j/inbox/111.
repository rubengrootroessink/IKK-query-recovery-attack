Jeff and Christie:

It was a pleasure having you here on campus.  Let me add my thanks to those
of the Entrepreneurial Manager faculty who actually taught the case.  I
think your presence added enormously to the success of the maiden voyage of
this case.

As I indicated to you, I want to make the case even stronger by
incorporating any additional data or suggestions that you may have after
seeing it taught.  Jeff, you indicated you had a couple of quick
corrections, and I'd appreciate receiving those.  Also if you have any
thoughts about how we might enrich the case, those would be welcome
too.  Christie, as indicated in our discussions, I think some sense of the
economics of Enron Online would be enormously helpful.  Even if we have to
use disguised data, can we break out the sales and profitability of the
trading operations before the launch of Enron Online.  With some indication
of what the new Internet-based model will do to margins, students can do
some simple calculations of the volume necessary to compensate, and
therefore have some idea of the enormously ambitious (and significantly
risky) venture that this turned out to be.  I will gladly talk further
about this with you directly or with whomever you want to put me in touch
with.  Let me emphasize that the data do not have to be actual data--we can
use disguised information that multiplies all the real data by a factor,
for example.

Thanks again for your incredible support through the development of this
material and its delivery.  I think it was a great success.

Regards,
Chris

P.S.  I am just looking at the beta version of the multimedia cases on
Enron's Transformation and Enron Online. These should be ready within a
couple of weeks and will allow students to read the case and click on
images of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Louise Kitchen as they talk about the
issues raised in the case. This should help students come to class with an
even richer understanding of the culture, values, and personal style of the
key players.
