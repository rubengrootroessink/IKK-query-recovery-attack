Brothers,
    Grumps ended up being treated for really nothing.  Once they got a good
look at the artery, they found it only to be 30% blocked (had been 100%
blocked the surgery before) and there's really nothing to do with that small
a blockage.  So, it's really good news.  Guess those echo cardiograms aren't
always real accurate.  It showed it blocked, causing the second procedure to
be prescribed.  All for naught, thank God.

yours in -kai-,
Drow

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
