Don't tell me that Harry is missing AGAIN!
Did you look in the OU locker room?  Maybe he's searching for answers to
the important questions - like what the hell happened up in Nebraska? I
mean with the Sooners crapping on themselves I now have to put up with all
the UT turds in Austin thinking they've got a shot at the national
championship.  Spare me.

Dear Brothers:

Perhaps it is my age. But I can't remember Bill Miller throwing me into any
fecal slime a mile or so from the SMU campus. But I do remember marching
his
ass all the way to Oklahoma during the dorg. Next time I will dump him in
the Red River and make him sing Boomer Sooner in his pink skivvies. By the
way, I still think the Oklahoma brothers should convene Nov. 17 for the
Tech-OU game. I'll invite some Kappas to the house and perhaps we can
reenact mud-puppy. By the way, has anybody seen Singleton?

Dent
