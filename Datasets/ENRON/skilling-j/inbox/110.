excess of $153,000,000 US. (See 'Asset Value with Facilities')

Purpose:
Phase I  - Ammonia fertilizer
Phase II  - Reclaimed solvents
Phase III  - Pollution Free Gasoline

1. Company Introduction - The Client Company was formed specifically to
commercialize its proprietary technology and the expertise for:

1) The conversion of low BTU natural gas in ammonia for fertilizer.

2) Specialty refining and reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates from
plastics manufacturing in order to convert these streams into products that
can be sold as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

3) The refining of low value petroleum feedstocks into pollution free
aviation fuel and marketable ultra high octane blending stock for unleaded
gasoline.

4) The reclamation/refining of spent chlorinated solvents in order to market
these streams as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

5) The employment of its technology in a world-class refinery to upgrade low
value petroleum feedstocks into aviation fuel and marketable ultra high
octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

In order to minimize the overall risk and the time required to achieve a
positive cash flow, the Client Company has developed a multi phase Strategic
Production Plan

Phase I is the smallest of the phases and will employ the Client Company's
expertise in ammonia production from low BTU natural gas.  Phase I can be
completed and show a profit within seven months of initial funding.

Phase II is somewhat larger than phase I and will employ its own unique
proprietary technology and a separate geographical facility location.  Phase
II can be completed within about twelve to fourteen month after funding and
the will show a profit about two months after startup. The future of this
phase of the Client Company's strategic plan is somewhat less clear today
than it appeared several months ago when the plan was developed.  The recent
dramatic rise in energy prices in the US has caused some generators of the
spent solvents that will be the feedstock for this facility to begin using
these streams for fuel.  A reevaluation of this situation is underway at the
present time and the decision as to the future of this phase will be made in
late first quarter of 2001.

Phase III, although much more capital intensive than phase II, has been
separated from phase IV for several reasons:

1. Environmental permits - the Phase III facility will be purely a petroleum
processing facility similar in principle to several hundred other petroleum
processing facilities in the State of Texas, and therefore, obtaining an air
emissions and operating permit should not take over six months.  In contrast
to this, the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated
solvents, Phase IV, will require between ten and eighteen months if all goes
well.

2. Equipment deliveries - the technology to be employed and the absence of
corrosive compounds in the processes for Phase III will allow the equipment
and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic
alloys, which will be required for the Phase IV, chlorinated solvent
reclamation process.

3. Transportation - the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products for
Phase III are much simpler than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks for Phase
IV.

Phase IV will utilize a location in the US while Phase V will probably be
located in the Caribbean.

2. History of Project: The project team members have invested six years and
in excess of 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS US in developing the technology and the
business opportunities which are described herein.

3. Mission Statement: The Client Company's mission is to capitalize on the
business opportunities it identifies, profitably employ its proprietary
technology, and where possible assist in solving environmental problems.

4. Funding Stage: Is a start-up without a financial history and is seeking
capital for facility construction and startup - straight debt funding, equity
investment or a combination of both.

5. Project Ownership? / Management
THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
The management team is comprised of eight individuals who between them have
over 200 years of successful experience in the petrochemical industry in R&D,
project management, and refinery management.  In addition the team includes
another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial experience in
banking, investment banking and financial management.

THE SCHEDULE
From the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months will
be required to construct the phase I plant, go through startup and be ready
to commence full-scale production.  The other phases will follow as indicated
above.

6. Unique Features (Key Considerations) of Project:

Ammonia production - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its principals' expertise in fertilizer production and
marketing and their successful experience in adapting proven processes to
unique opportunities.  The Client Company is in the process of finalizing a
gas purchasing agreement with a firm that has acquired the mineral rights to
large area of land in west Texas under which is located a significant deposit
of low BTU natural gas.  The Client Company can purchase this gas at very
attractive pricing.  While this gas is not suitable for sale as "pipeline"
quality gas it is suitable for the production of ammonia.

Solvent reclamation - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology and its principals' expertise in
reclaiming spent solvent streams and rafinates, and refining them into usable
fuels.  Some of these are currently being incinerated as hazardous waste and
others are being blended into low value products.  The Client Company's
proprietary refining technology has the ability to process these materials
and convert them into value added products.

Pollution free gasoline - This Phase of the Strategic Production Plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology for the refining of low value
petroleum feedstocks into pollution free aviation fuel and marketable ultra
high octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

The Client Company will utilize ABC Industries to broker its products and
assist in feedstock procurement. ABC Industries currently arranges for the
supply of feedstock to DEF Fuels, one of the Client Company's major
customers, and brokers their products.  ABC Industries will also
broker/market to other customers any left over high-octane blend stock and
all of the aviation gasoline.

The Client Company plans to offer its unleaded gasoline at a price of
one-half to one cent below the locally posted rack price.  Rack price is the
price that a distributor pays for products at the terminal loading rack and
varies somewhat from day to day and though out the year as gasoline demand
and crude oil prices vary.

FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY - The feedstock for the ammonia facility will be low BTU
natural gas from the gas field directly under and surrounding the facility.
The feedstock for the solvents reclamation will be obtained directly from the
generators of the spent solvents.  The feedstock for the gasoline production
facility will be obtained from several LPG producers in the West Texas area.

The cost of the majority of the Client Company's feedstocks have historically
tracked the price of crude oil as has the price of gasoline at the rack and
retail pump.  The solvent feed stocks will be procured from the generators
with the aid of several brokers who normally deal in these materials.  These
spent solvents will be shipped to the Client Company facility at the port by
truck, railroad tank car and barge.

THE TECHNOLOGY - The Client Company has developed its own proprietary
technology for:

1. The refining/reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates and their
conversion into value added products.
2.  The production of ultra high octane blend stock for use in unleaded
gasoline and aviation fuel.
3.   The reclamation of chlorinated solvents.

The possibility of patent protection for these technologies is being explored
with one patent already filed.  Initial patent searches do not indicate any
potential infringement of existing patents, but the Client Company makes no
representation as to the ability to secure patent protection.  However, every
effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the nature of the
processes that the Client Company will employ in its facilities.

The Client Company process for making unleaded gasoline has been operated on
a semi-plant scale for several months and the products successfully sold to
independent gasoline distributors.

The plants will be designed to meet all of the current standards including
EPA, API, OSHA, ASME and good engineering practice.

THE COMPETITION - The Phase I operation will face very limited competition
because the ammonia plants which in the past have served the west Texas, New
Mexico, and western Oklahoma area have all been shut down during the past
several years.  Therefore, all of the ammonia consumed in the region is being
shipped in by truck or railcar.  The Client Company believes that freight
considerations alone will provide sufficient cost differential to insure that
it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local
market.

The Phase II operation will face very limited competition because we have
been able to identify only one dedicated facility that is doing work similar
to what the Client Company will be doing.  The main advantage the Client
Company will enjoy is the ability to assure the generators of the spent
solvents and rafinates that their waste will be processed in such a manner,
and with the high level quality control which only a dedicated facility can
maintain, that the end products will be of such quality that the generator
will no longer face the present contingent liability caused by product
failure in their final application.

For the Phase III facility at Dallas Texas, the Client Company will face very
little local competition for its ultra high-octane blend stock and reasonable
competition for its aviation fuel.  At the present time there does not exist
any local producer of ultra high-octane blend stock and it along with
aviation fuel is being shipped in from the Gulf Coast and other more distant
suppliers.  Others who might attempt to duplicate the Client Company's
approach will not have access to the Client Company's proprietary technology
and will be at a distinct economic disadvantage. At the present time the
Client Company is not aware of competition that might tend to drive up prices
for the petroleum feedstocks (i.e., normal and isobutane) that will be used
in its Phase II process.  These feedstocks are available in more than
adequate quantities at the prices used to calculate the proforma's.

7. Overview of Market: - The overall nationwide market for unleaded gasoline
is in excess of 342,000,000 gallons per day. The overall nationwide market
for aviation fuel (100 octane gasoline) is in excess of 67,000,000 gallons
per day.  The local Dallas Texas market for aviation fuel is in excess of
750,000 gallons per day.  This market is expected to grow about 2% per year
for the foreseeable future. The Client Company has set as its corporate
objective to capture 15% of the Dallas aviation gasoline market over the next
five years.

Approximately six billion gallons per year solvents are used in the US for
various cleaning applications.  The disposal of the resulting hazardous waste
is a major cost for the user.  The Client Company will use these spent
solvent blends as a feedstock and thereby remove the "hazardous waste"
designation from the material.  At a processing rate of 100,000 gallons per
day the Client Company will process about 0.6% of the solvents that are
available for recycle or reclamation in the US.

8. Financial Overview (USD) - see the attached proforma.

9. Use of Funds - see the attached sources and uses statement. (The numbers
are solid to use at project.  In the loan amount, we have add the pre-funding
cost)


ASSET VALUE OF the Client Company W/FACILITIES

TECHNOLOGY - Within 18 months of initial funding the Client Company will have
the following patent applications filed and assigned to the Client Company:

1. Composition of matter patent covering its butane isomerization catalyst.

2. Composition of matter patent covering its structured/ solid alkalation
catalyst.

3. A process patent covering its chlorinated solvent reclamation catalyst.
 
4. A process patent covering its process for the optimum dispersion of light
hydrocarbons in ethanol.

5. A process patent for its process for the reclamation of an existing waste
solvent.

6. A process patent for its process for benzene destruction in Platformate.

7. Several (3+) process patents for the reclamation of spent solvents and
rafinates.

The patent searches for all of these have been completed and in the informal
opinion of our patent attorney all of these patents will probably be granted.

Number 1 & 2, above, can currently be obtained from UOP and Phillips
Petroleum, for example, for about a million dollars per year (royalty or
technology fee) each.  Once we have fully proven these two in long-term plant
performance tests, the Client Company may well elect to market this
technology.

By present day appraisal methods, (i.e. actual and estimated royalty values)
these patents will be worth between five and seven million dollars per year
to the Client Company.  Using standard "future value" calculations (ten
years, 3% inflation) the asset value of these patents is $67,800,000.

LAND - Dallas Texas  - It is the Client Company's intention to purchase
approximately 100 acres of land in Texas as the site for the Dallas / Ft 
Worth facility.  A portion of this land will be purchased
