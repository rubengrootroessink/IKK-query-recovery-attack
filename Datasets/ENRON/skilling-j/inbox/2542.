Drow,

You don't want to hear this, but if they have already pursued every angle of appeal (A two sentence statement sounds pretty final.) to no good result, then they have to fight fire with fire.  If this was more a political move than anything else, they need to apply to come back in an equal and opposite posture so the national can look good accepting their application.

How?  Get the black fraternity on board (quietly at first) showing them this chapter "was not fairly represented by these stupid acts", something to that effect.  By on board I mean Beta leaders meet their leaders and convince them to endorse the application to national (A letter from them would be powerful, saying 'these guys are real and they are rushing some of our people', I don't know).  The re-charter, then, is a correction of the mistakes and, therefore, the new chapter is clean.

As you can tell, I know nothing of the procedures behind a charter and this could take forever, but what alternatives are there if the appeals fell flat?

To quote another ass from Little Rock, I feel your pain, as I have Travis, Tyler and Trenton coming along later and I will fight like hell to protect my guys from this type of injustice in any case.

Sarl, Hans Hohl, Carl

... And I hope to be a better one.

e, a Beta pledge at Auburn, called me last night to
>inform me their chapter's charter has been revoked, effectively ending 34
>years of Beta's at Auburn.  At a recent costume party, several pledges (Joe
>NOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all black
>fraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat's
>letters.  As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reaction
>in Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement,
>ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.  The incident coincided with

>on a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their party
