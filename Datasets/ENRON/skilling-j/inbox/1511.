Hello Jeff (and/or Joanie),

Thank you so much for agreeing to review our manuscript and provide an
endorsement.  Hopefully it arrived today from our publisher.  I just wanted
to check on that and to remind you that you are looking at the "first pages"
which have been subjected to several more rounds of edits and changes, but
we wanted to give you the cleanest copy we had available at this point in
time.  We would be happy to discuss the book in more detail as you compose
your comments.

Thank you again, and we look forward to hearing from you.
