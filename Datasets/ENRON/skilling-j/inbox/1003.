Dear Mr Skilling,

http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2

Update on IBC's major international conference:
BASEL - MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES
31st October and 1st November 2001 - New York

We have obviously considered very carefully whether to continue with this event in the light of the recent terrible events in New York. However, as the business community appears to be trying to get back to normal as far as possible, we have decided that the conference should proceed as planned.

We therefore hope you will take this excellent opportunity to hear the industry response to the latest Basel proposals on Capital Adequacy and Risk Management, and to gain practical advice on meeting the significant business challenges that these proposals pose to the management of risk within the financial services industry.

Conference highlights include:

* A keynote address from William Rutledge, Executive Vice President, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

* An impressive panel of leading industry speakers - visit the event website http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 for full programme details.

* Round table discussion: examining the key elements of operational risk management and control

* Outstanding networking opportunity - over 100 delegates attended our European Capital Adequacy event earlier this year

To reserve your place call +44 (0)1932 853 857, visit http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2, or e-mail cust.serv@informa.com. Alternatively, please forward this e-mail to any colleagues from ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES CORP who may also be interested in attending.

Kind regards

Allison Lindsay
Deputy Conference Director
