When Enbridge (U.S.) Inc. acquired Midcoast Energy Resources, Inc. in May
2001, Midcoast had over 80 pipeline systems in 10 states, the Gulf of
Mexico and Canada, comprising over 4,100 miles of pipe, which were
transporting in excess of 1.25 bcf/d, with total revenues of $800 million
in 2000.  Midcoast had grown from $0 to $600 million in just five years in
its industry.  So why did Dan Tutcher decide it was time to stop what
Midcoast was doing and merge?
