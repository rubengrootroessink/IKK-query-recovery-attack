The Paradox of our time
  By George Carlin

  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings
but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend
more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less.

  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but
less time; we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but
less judgment; more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less
wellness.

  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.

  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk
too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make
a living, but not a life, we've added years to life, not life to years.

  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not
inner space.   We've done larger things, but not better things.

  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the
atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan
more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more
copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; big men and
small character; steep profits and shallow relationships.

  These are the days of two incomes, but more divorce, fancier houses,
but broken homes.

  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality,
one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from
cheer, to quiet, to kill.

  It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the
stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a
time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
delete.

  Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not
going to be around forever.

  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is
the only treasure you  can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a
cent.

  Remember, to say "I Love You" to your partner and your loved ones, but
most of all, mean it.
  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of
you.

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person
will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, give
time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

  To my family, and all my friends in my life, thanks for being there!
George Carlin
