                  It's been an interesting week for the energy industry.  A=
 number of recent announcements hint at some long term changes in the way t=
he energy industry will look 15 years from now.  International Fuel Cells  =
have announced that Woking, UK will be the home of the first commercial fue=
l cell in the UK (for more information on this story see the article below)=
, and Puget Sound Energy  is extending their conservation program that take=
s advantage of real-time pricing for consumers.  It would seem that the lon=
g-promised benefits of fuel cells are turning the corner and are beginning =
to offer a viable commercial alternative.  Consumers are soon to be faced w=
ith even more options on where they get their power from, and with the incr=
easingly ability of utilities to pass on the real costs and benefits of the=
ir power choices, their choice will be an important one.  It opens up a wor=

 they're forced to look at where they get their power from and when they us=

crises in the States have given it the push it needed to turn the corner.  =
 As dramatically as the downstream and retail side of the energy industry i=
s set to change in the next 12 months, the wholesale energy market continue=
s to face almost daily changes.  One of the articles in this week's briefin=
g is an interview  with Canada's Watt-Ex.  It would seem that while cross U=
S-Canadian energy trading is developing apace, there are still a number of =
hurdles on both sides of the fence to be overcome.  Recent announcements at=
 Enron in the past week or two, suggest that Energy's golden boy is having =
a few teething problems... is this the opportunity for rivals like the ICE,=
 TradeSpark, and Dynegy to consolidate their recent gains?  And what does i=
t mean for exchanges like HoustonStreet and RedMeteor that have been strugg=
ling of late?  There's a lot of talk about consolidation and it seems to be=
 picking up steam...   On a final note, you probably know that the Eyeforen=
ergy team is going to be down in New Orleans next week for our Energy Excha=
