Dear Mr Skilling

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely
