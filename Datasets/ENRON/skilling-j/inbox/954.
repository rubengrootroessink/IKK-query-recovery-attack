Mr. Skilling,

I have been attempting to work with Enron Broadband for over six months;
indeed, we have an 'Agent' agreement.  With the recent market
disequilibrium, it has become next to impossible to close deals with
your company.  Like you, I am a consultant, a deal-broker, a veritable
rainmaker.  Unlike you, I didn't consult with a big firm.  I am
independent an am extremely hungry.

That said, I would love to sit with you to discuss opportunities of
where Enron is going and how they are going to get there.  These
impromptu emails often work and have even afforded me one-on-one chats
with the likes of  VISA founder, Dee Hock!  I can provide further
background information should you be interested in meeting.  I have many
ideas on the telecom future for Enron that are exciting, practical, and
profit mongering.

I'd love the chance to speak with you over the phone, on instant
messenger, or even face-to-face.

With perspicuity and aplomb,

Michael Wilson
