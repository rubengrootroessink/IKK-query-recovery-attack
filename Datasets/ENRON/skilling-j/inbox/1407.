Brothers,
 
EWooglin has been taking a nap.  Some time ago Yahoo acquired  E-Group, where our SMU Beta Theta Pi group site was located.  Be sure  to update your e-mail address book with the new address to use to reach all  the members with one easy e-mail:
 smu-betas@yahoogroups.com 
 
If you want to check out the site...have your ID name and password  handy and sign in at:
 http://groups.yahoo.com/ 
 
Apparently, our pictures didn't make the transition to Yahoo.   Feel free to start rebuilding our album in your spare time.
