A married couple is driving down the interstate doing 55 mph. The
husband is behind the wheel. His wife looks over at him. "Honey, I know
we've been married for 15 years, but, I want a divorce."

The husband says nothing but slowly increases speed to 60 mph.

"I don't want you to try to talk me out of it, because I've been having
an affair with your best friend, and he's a better lover than you."

Again the husband stays quiet and just speeds up as his anger increases.

"I want the house also." Again the husband speeds up, and now is doing
75 mph.

"I want the kids too." The husband just keeps driving faster and faster,
now he's up to 85 mph.  "And I want the car, the checking account, and
all the credit cards."

The husband slowly starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling as the
speedometer reaches 90 mph. "You're taking this incredibly calmly," the
wife says. "Isn't there anything that you want?"

"No, I have everything I need."

"What's that?"

"The airbag."
