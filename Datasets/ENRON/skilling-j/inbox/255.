Jeff:

Congratulations.  I am pleased to see things have continued to go very well
for you.  I would like to re-establish my connection with Enron.  I was
wondering if you might be able to introduce me to Billy Lemmons or Cindy
Olson.

I look forward to staying in touch and thanks for your help.

Gary Barton
