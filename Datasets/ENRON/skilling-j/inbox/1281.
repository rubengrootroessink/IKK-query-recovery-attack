Scrotum Face,
   Would be happy to play literary critic for a day on Amazon.com.  Have
just one more chapter to go and am enjoying it very much.  Am going to
re-read it because I'm just too slow to stay with all the names and places
in the first few chapters.  I could tell later in the book that I wasn't
paying enough attention early on to remember who was famous for what.
That's just a long way of saying my mind is finally suffering the
consequences of many, many years of brain cell destruction at the hands of
thousands and thousands of little 12 oz. red and white cans.  It's another
great book and hope it is doing well for you.  I know you worked your ass
off on it and it shows.
   I'll log on for the review after I re-read it OK?

Yours in -kai-,
Drow


PS.  Joe really does have Beta football practice twice a week at 5:30 in the
fricking morning!!!!  Ain't it great to be a maggot?

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.
