Boys:
 
I would like to nominate Elvis for the greatest  single email in the first year of ewooglin.com. The stuff about 76ers and worms  and geese and Ojedas and the "onlyest ewooglin.com" and the first dorg ever in  University Park is the best shit I've read in a long time. And I'm a fucking  writer. Any clicks?
 
Dent

Yes, Elvis is still  alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are  the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the  class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated  the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people  than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1  year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on  Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.
