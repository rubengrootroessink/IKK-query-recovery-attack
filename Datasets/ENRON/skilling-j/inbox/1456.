Harry Jim,
   The reasons Hutch rarely (if ever) threw to you are too numerous to list
in this missive but he once told me the MAIN reason (beside those
unmistakable dual skillets on the end of your short little arms) was that he
was afraid if you really started stretching out those stumps you had for
legs, that you would be arrested for indecent exposure due to the length (or
lack of same) of those gonad exposing shorts of yours.


Yours in -kai-,
Drow


PS.  I wasn't slow until Gigi's Dad force fed me triple-meat-triple-cheese,
fully loaded burgers every day during the summer after my freshman year.
Besides, I had what you call deceptive speed.....I was slower than I looked.
