Dear Jeff:

energy companies in California and other states frightened by the perceived  
effects of energy

> perceived as "giving in" to the energy interests. However, I believe that  
the Latino community in southern and northern California would be open minded  
in the energy debate and would be impressed with support for Latino  
candidates and causes. As you know, Latino elected officals now control the  
California State Assembly.  
      Before I moved my family to Houston four years ago, I had lived in Los  
Angeles for seventeen years and I still have a pretty good network. I would  
be pleased to help in any way I can, including  making introductions, and  
discussing options.

Take good care,
