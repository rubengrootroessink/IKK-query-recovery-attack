 has caused a spike in prices, and Enron and Dynergy have both reported rec=
ord earnings.   As you can imagine with everything going on, we had a hard =
time focusing on just one issue for this edition of the Briefing.  Instead,=
 we decided to give you a bit of everything-some e-business news with a loo=
