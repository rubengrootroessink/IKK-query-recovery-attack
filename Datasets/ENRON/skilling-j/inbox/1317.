Dear Friend,
 
I hope that this letter finds you in good spirits and health, and that you've returned from your summer refreshed.  One of the highlights of my summer is watching "The First Year," a new documentary by Davis Guggenheim.  I was profoundly touched by this film, and want to encourage you to watch it, as it will be broadcast by PBS throughout the country over the next few days.
 
"The First Year" follows five young people through their rookie year of teaching in the Los Angeles public school system.  The film draws the viewer in by weaving together personal and incredibly human stories of novice teachers trying to connect with and nurture their students.  "The First Year" is a truly moving portrait of our nation's schools; I guarantee that it will inspire both hope and outrage.
 
The show airs this Wednesday, September 5 at 7:30pm on WGBX in the Boston area, and premieres on PBS in most other cities on September 6 at 9pm.
 
The attached file has the air dates for most major markets, for example:
In New York on September 7 at 9pm
In Boston on September 5 at 7:30 pm
In San Francisco and Los Angeles on Sept 6 at 9pm

I sincerely hope that you will watch "The First Year."  I guarantee that it won't be a waste of your valuable time.
 
Many thanks and best regards!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Li Lu
