George Steinwart : Son of a bitch ! So you must have had like a 3.25 or
something, cause I KNOW I must have had a ........3.28....yeah, that's it.
a 3.28.!   I remember telling my Freshman math professor, in all
seriousness, that the reason I was failing was because I was pledging a
fraternity and didn't he understand.....it was the MOST important part of
the college experience after all.  What have you been up to for the last 30
years ?

ZEBA #460.............Who was #459 and #461 ?
