Hi Jeff,

I am Andy Liu, Co-founder and President of NetConversions, a company based
in Seattle.  Our company helps Fortune 1000/Global 2000 companies improve
their online presence and email communications to better serve customers.
Our True Usability(TM) solution identifies areas of improvement that will
ensure better customer experience thus driving more customers to pay their
bills online or to conserve more energy or to facilitate communication.
Given your business objectives, we can help you achieve it on a large scale.
We can help launch an email campaign that improves each time an email is
opened.  Our technology is based on leading research from Wharton and
UT-Austin professors and have been proven to be successful.  I would like to
share with you some of the solutions we use to help our clients realize
their business goals.  I'd be happy to speak with you over the phone.  What
time would be most convenient for you: Friday, May 11th at 10am or Monday,
May 14th at 11am? Thanks!

Best regards,
Andy Liu
