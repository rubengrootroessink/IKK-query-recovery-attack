Hi Jeff, 
Thanks for speaking last Wednesday on 29, it was my first floor meeting with you and I found it informative.  I like your informal, "no bones about it" style, a style I wish more people would adopt.

During the meeting you had made some references about your previous guest which concerned me.  As an employee and shareholder in Enron, it occurred to me that some of the comments would not benefit Enron if they were ever leaked out to the press, (ie. like the Houston Chronicle article on the PRC process).

I do have one question to ask, with your light hearted comment about "Air India"; In order to achieve the vision of being the "World's Leading Company" do you anticipate we will further develop business activities within existing areas, or do you anticipate Enron becoming involved in entirely new business areas?  In other words, do you see us building new businesses which represent a natural evolution of our current activities, or do you anticipate something more radical?  A couple of months ago you said in an interview that you will continue running the company, in a business as usual fashion, will that change?


Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.
