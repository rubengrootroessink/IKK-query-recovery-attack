I would like to share with you a personal struggle I go through as the
United Way contribution campaign rolls around each year.  First I would like
commend the United Way as an organization that does help people in need in
our community.  At the same time it funds the Boy Scouts of America, an
organization with an explicit policy to discriminate against gays.

I know I can direct my contribution within United Way, but not until the United Way
sees a drop in its total fund raising will it withdraw funding of the Boy Scouts
of America. I hope all involved in this effort understand why I and others
choose not to contribute to the United Way and instead make direct contributions 
to organizations that do not discriminate.
