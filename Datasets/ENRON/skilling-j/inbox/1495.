Jeff,

Thought I bring this by you.  Just happened to think about one of or the final episode for the building guy that would end up very appropriately when the new building is finished.  How about, maybe near its completion,  the building guy meets the "building girl", fall in love and marry on top of the Enron Building.  The "two" (buildings) join as one and live happily ever after in Enron World.  Could be a televised promotion.

Just a thought,
Robert
