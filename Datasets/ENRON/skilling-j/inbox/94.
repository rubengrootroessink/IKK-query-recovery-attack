Jeff:  I've been trying to get large enterprises to use us for getting incremental bandwidth.  The current mindset seems to be either "I already have too much bandwidth" or that "I need my network to be secure; how can I trust you to be in business five years from now?".  Can you suggest some ways of breaking this gridlock?  I firmly believe that getting some Fortune 50's on our roster will establish our reputation.

BTW, congratulations on making it on yet another list (this time a personal honor in Worth magazine).
