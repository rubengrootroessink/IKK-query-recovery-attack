Space-- Well said. I remember some of these people begging for mercy in The
Pit. They were not as cocky then as they are now.

#454 (I was always proud of being one number lower than Strap Anderson
indicating a marginally better GPA)

As a Beta from the distinguished class of 1973 and a Nebraskan living in
Oklahoma I would like to make a few comments about the letters below from
the distinguished Oklahoma weenie doctor  Bill Miller and sharp tongued very
popular Oklahoman transplanted author the one and only Jim Dent.
First -NEBRASKA did not get stomped.

Second -the great class of 1973 ,(Picture attached) who helped pledged you
arrogant sissies from the classes of 75 and 76, think it's time you get out
the Loving Cup and pass it around again.

Finally- neither Jim Dent or Bill Miller have invited any of the class of 73
who reside in Oklahoma over for -kai- (for Beek that's F&F). But we in the
class of 73 are not bitter even though a visit the beautiful and prestigious
Nichols Hills (Oklahoma's answer to Highland Park) would boost our spirits
in these times.  Anyway I hope I speak for the silent  E-Wooglin.com members
when I say  I'm glad I didn't buy any of that ENRON stock.
Oh and by the way no one need respond to this note as I remain
affectionately yours,  Tom Hosman (that's Space for Beek and #456 for  those
of you who are still counting).
