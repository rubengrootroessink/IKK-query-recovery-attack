Dear Jeff,

Life is always full of surprises.  I feel very lucky to have had the
chance to know and appreciate you for who you are instead of for who
people think you are.  Another turn in your life will be nothing less
than another opportunity to continue to achieve all your goals.  This
transition will be understood by your friends and family who will
continue to support you.

Very friendly yours,
William
