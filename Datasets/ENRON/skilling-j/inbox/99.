Would an investment of five days be worth a comment from your child such as

"Dad, this is the best trip I've ever been on." Michael Montgomery, son of
YPOer William Montgomery (Cincinnati)

Or would that same five days with your child be valuable if you could say:

"It was clear that each parent and child had shared a special time that
could only be experienced in the wilderness.  Away from television, the
Internet and the conveniences we mistake as necessities, we all
rediscovered the simple pleasures of conversation and time together."  Tonn
Ostergard (Nebraska)

Enjoy the splendor of the Rocky Mountains in a program exclusively designed
for you or your spouse and your child.  As you rock climb, rappel, hike and
backpack you will strengthen your family bonds as you are physically
challenged in this rugged yet beautiful environment.  Your nights will be
spent under the stars as you tell stories around a roaring campfire, play
games and enjoy fellowship with other YPO families.

For fourteen years, the Parent Child Mountain Adventure has helped
facilitate stronger one-on-one family bonding experiences for over 300 YPO
members and their children.  Professional guides from Young Life's
Wilderness Ranch guide YPOers and their children through the three-day
journey.  This is not a luxury retreat.  You will wear your sweaty cap as a
badge of courage and pride.  Flexibility and laid back leadership will be
your chief assets as you and your child learn more about each other.... and
you will learn more about yourself.
