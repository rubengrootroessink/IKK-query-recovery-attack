Sorry to bother you with another note, but I've received so much reaction to my Tully parking notice, I'm writing again to tell you not to be concerned about being locked out of the Stadium if you're riding the bus back.  Some people think they're not going to get in by 11:00, and are concerned about not being able to get their cars out.  The last bus leaves Austin at 7 pm, and that would certainly get you there by 11:00, but if it doesn't for some reason, they're not going to lock the stadium until the last bus has dropped of its passengers.
