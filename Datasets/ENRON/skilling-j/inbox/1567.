Jeffrey,
 
Got your letter; will call you early in the week you get back from your trip with an update, unless you would find it preferable to set aside some time during your trip for a chat.  If the latter sounds better, let me know how to reach you.  If the former is your preference, let me know so I can set up a time with Sherri.
 
Enjoy you trip with Jeffrey Jr.; hope you at least find the desserts there more tasty than those flaky things they serve up out west in California.    
 
Take solace in the fact that your stature here to the east continues to grow.  Sukran's dad has found a resemblance between you and Ataturk; its apparently in the eyes and forehead (and perhaps in his imagination).   
 
Say hey to the kids and Rebecca.  Sukran sends her love
 
Yours,
 
Mark
