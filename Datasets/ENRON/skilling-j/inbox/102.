Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and  to meet you at the=
 luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be  interested in =
the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection  with the =
bike ride over the weekend.
=20
Several persons  who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to t=
he National Multiple  Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails a=
sking if I am still alive  after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past=
 weekend. Others have asked for  a report of my experience. I am alive and =
sore. If you are not interested in the  report, please delete this email.
=20
First of all, for  those who have pledged or already sent you checks payabl=
e to the National  Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate wor=
d.  Remember  that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yours=
elf with your  contributions.
=20
This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story  unlike anything I ev=
er expected.
=20
Here is my story, if  you are interested:
=20
BASIC  FACTS:
=20
1.  I did show  up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).
=20
2.  I did start  the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in =
the largest charity  bike ride in the country.
=20
3.  I did ride  my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day,=
 some 199 miles down  the road..
=20
4.  I did  either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 18=
2 miles of the  199 mile route.
=20
5.  I crossed  the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the dead=
line of 6:00 pm  on Sunday.
=20
6.  I ended up  meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the tri=
p.  That  resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of=
 the pack of  9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before=
 I reached  Austin.
=20
7.  I am  extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't hav=
e the time  to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate t=
o have a schedule  which opened up just in time for me to enter this  event=
.
=20
=20
RANDOM GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS:
=20
1.  The charity  event title, "MS150", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for=
 this event, I  understood the "150" part of the event title to refer to th=
e mileage between  Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The "150" I now unders=
tand to mean the  approximate number of blisters to be found on one's poste=
rior when a biker  crosses the finish line. =20
=20
2.  I have  driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There ar=
e routes  between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a ge=
ntle  grade.  We took a different route.
=20
3.  The ride  from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route w=
e took was almost  40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a ma=
p appeared  similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an=
 Aggie to find  the shortest distance between two points.
=20
4.  Road kill  if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.
=20
5.  The chicken  ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  T=
he  LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of=
 the  first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club =
 volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with r=
anch  dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and  =
wondered whether the historical connection was  intentional.=20
=20
STRATEGY
=20
I knew when I signed  up for this event that I had almost no chance of comp=
leting the ride which, at  the time I entered, I thought was only 150 miles=
.  I had not trained at all  for the bike ride, and was (and am) not physic=
ally fit and dont exercise as I  should.  The total extent of my bike ridin=
g during the year prior to  the event was when rode my mountain bike from m=
y home to a  sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip.=
  Round trip,  my "training" ride to the sporting goods store was about 3  =
miles.
=20
I sufficiently  realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some adv=
antage  to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with wha=
t I  thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked fo=
r the  largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike duri=
ng  the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that per=
son  (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I thou=
ght  it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had=
 a slower  pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end =
of the  ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person=
  appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath=
  of air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and=
  pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.    For =
the first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could=
  tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly  be=
hind this large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person  =
biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on  =
this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another  biker.
=20
I needed a new  strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materiali=
ze in spades,   but not before noon the second day of the ride.
=20
=20
THE RIDE IN  DETAIL
=20
I signed up for this  event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a res=
ult of my schedule  opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily =
commited.  I  did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning =
when I  learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I sta=
rted the fund  raising effort, which is a required part of participating as=
 a  rider.
=20
Iknew I was  out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco =
in even attempting  this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not kee=
p up the normal pace  of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I=
 made a pledge to  myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert my=
self.  I would  establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being=
 winded.  I  succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day =
of the  ride.
=20
I kept a pace that  was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride =
for the first 4  hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happ=
y with the ride,  and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the a=
nnouncer has  promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker =
when we reached  Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to Bel=
lville, I came to  realize that my pace, although not strenous, was substan=
tially off the  mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders, ther=
e were only four  box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I though=
t back, I  remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my coun=
t,  9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.   They=
 all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace  at little af=
ter lunch.
=20
I headed out after a  quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around 2=
:00 to 3:00, I  was really getting tired and although still cautious about =
over exertion, I was  losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in=
  a small town, and  called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did n=
ot think I would make it  much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I cou=
ld.  I rode about 10  more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when =
I remember thinking  "I desparately need a long rest".  About that time, I =
looked up at  a road sign that said "Cemetery, next exit".  The symbolic co=
nnection  was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporar=
y,  not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in  s=
ome high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and I =
 bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a "SAG" bus, designed  to =
pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, int=
o  a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was "finished" and that I d=
id  not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I wa=
s  extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about=
 80% of  the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I co=
ncluded I  was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.
=20
After traveling in  the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance t=
o a ranch of a  friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. =
I asked the van  driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was =
home.  I went to  visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and =
I ended up spending  about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I f=
inally decided to  leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength=
.  I thought I  might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I=
 rode for about  another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van c=
ame and picked me  up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continu=
e. I was only 3 miles  short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, =
and the van carried me on to  this historic spot.
=20
I had really been  looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a mem=
ber of Team Enron, and  Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by repu=
tation, outstanding.   They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to the =
Team Enron bikers, and a  dinner fit for a king would be waiting.  Unfortun=
ately, by the time I  arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our accomodatio=
ns for the evening, dinner  in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuse=
s had vanished.  I finally  found a general meal service hosted by the loca=
l Rotarians who were serving  barbecued chicken, and a salad with ranch dre=
ssing.
=20
Since I didnt enter  the bike event until less than two weeks before it sta=
rted, Team Enron's private  tent was full and I was relegated to find sleep=
ing space on my own.  I was  directed to a huge feedlot covered with a larg=
e tin roof, open air style (no  walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag u=
nder the big roof with  about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I w=
as probably to sleep where a  cow going to market had probably slept only d=
ays before.  But I was dog  tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have t=
he energy to find less aeromatic,  alternative, accomodations. =20
=20
=20
THE SECOND  DAY
=20
=20
I was told that  breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and =
that the ride would  start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I coul=
d sleep until 6 am,  grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate b=
y 640.  Needless to  say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as =
possible.  I badly  needed the rest. My plan failed.
=20
I did not take into  consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gun=
g-ho superbikejocks.   About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake =
up, a large group of  overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing=
 side straddle hops,  stretching, and various exercises while making Monica=
 Seles-like grunting  noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go ba=
ck to sleep! The  five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholl=
y  inadequate.
=20
I was told that Day  2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1 =
because of the more hilly  route as we approached Austin.  To make a long s=
tory short,  I  actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I a=
ctually learned some  technique for transferring power from my arms to my l=
egs, and made it to Austin  on my own power without any motorized help of a=
ny kind.
=20
The ride through the  hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a tast=
e of ole country Texas  along the way. The bike route intentionally  meande=
rs via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy  highway tr=
affic for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one  small town t=
hat I never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that  said  "THELMA'=
S PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS". A sign of equal size  immediately adjacent s=
aid "NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE".  It was  comforting to know that patrons of=
 that establishment could drink  peacefully while game playing, knowing tha=
t customers are  required to  go out to the parking lot to resolve domino d=
isagreements where guns are not  prohibited. I guess I have spent too  much=
 time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about th=
e  genuine Texas back country!!=20
=20
=20
There was one other  noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State P=
ark is known to be  one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of t=
he extreme winding hills  in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park=
 is also confusing  because of its multiple intersecting roads through the =
park. I was  following another biker as we approached the park who was spor=
ting a very fancy  biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I m=
entioned to him  that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State P=
ark because of the  challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a r=
oute through  the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles s=
horter than  the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the pros=
pect of a  short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and s=
horter  route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according t=
o  my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep in=
clines,  and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and =
ten  minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the park---------=
-----at  the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted and not  a=
mused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the =
 shortest route to Austin.
=20
To fast forward the  story, since this has been far too long already, I mad=
e it to Austin on my own  power and did not ask for a lift at all the secon=
d day.  I was looking  forward to getting a much needed shower when I arriv=
ed at the finishing line  at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put =
in my most strenuous  effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the v=
ery hilly Austin area where  every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kis=
sing cousin.  Unfortunately  for the person who sat next to me on the bus c=
oming back to Houston, I was  told just after crossing the finish line that=
 the last bus would leave  for Houston in only a few minutes and there was =
no time to  shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped ou=
t of a sweat  shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what =
I dreaded--he  introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't=
 want this guy  to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bu=
s the aroma  of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I hel=
d out my still  sweaty hand, and proudly said, "Howdy, my name's Harry  Rea=
soner."
=20
Conclusion:
=20
I participated in  this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and ot=
hers who are victims of  MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo pl=
edges that are impossible  for anyone to calculate, please send my secretar=
y a check made payable to  National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever =
amount makes you happy.  If  you have not made a donation, won't you do so =
today? You will benefit by giving  as much as the people with MS who need y=
our help.  Thank  you.
