     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This =
week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather i=
n the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main f=
eature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly vol=
atile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (includ=
e those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfo=
lio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are =
already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential =
tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature o=
utlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies ca=
n identify and consolidate new opportunities, and reap real financial benef=
it from minimal risk.   Also, this week saw Eyeforenergy's conference in Si=
ngapore, which has been a resounding success.  In a future issue of the Bri=
efing, we will bring you details of events as they unfolded at this three-d=
ay meeting of some of the most influential and forward-thinking companies a=
nd organizations in the Asian energy market.  For now, you can apply for un=

vion is paved with the bleached bones of those that failed to manage risk. =
It has been said that economic history is the history of people learning to=
 manage risk. As deregulation takes root, power providers are spreading the=
