I know you're hoping, like I am, that Team Enron will retain its First Place position in the MS150 fundraising results for 2001.  Come and find out for yourself at the Awards Party:
June 28
5:00 to 8:00 PM
Arial Theatre @ Bayou Place
500 Texas St, Houston, TX 77002 
(713) 221-8883
(Team Enron's total for 2001 will be announced by e-mail on June 15, at 2:30 p.m.)
This party is for everybody who participated as a rider or volunteer in the MS150 bike tour, and it is here that you can pick up the prizes you have earned and celebrate the team results.  Thank you for all you have done toward our team's success !!
A new approach:
We are designing a custom form for Team Enron registrations for the 2002 MS150, and will have a table at the party so you can sign up early, directly with us, for those low numbers you like to get.  Come see us there!
All the money you have turned in is being carefully reconciled with MS this week and next, and the amounts will be in order by the 28th.  If you have any money yet to be processed, please contact me, Stephanie Strong, 713-853-1653 or Becky Pham at 713-345-7094 ASAP.  Please contact us rather than MS if you have any questions or comments about your pledges.
Thank you!!!!
