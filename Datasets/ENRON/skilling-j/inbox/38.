   Tomorrow night, come enjoy the sunset with HTC and mixer underwriter The
Tenagra Corp. (http://www.tenagra.com) on SkyBar's penthouse patio!

          Digital Mixer
          SkyBar
          3400 Montrose
          Thursday, 4.19.01
          5:30 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.

  Bring your clients, coworkers and friends, as SkyBar is giving us the
entire club with two outdoor patios and two bars for the mixer.    Parking
is available in the four-story garage adjacent to SkyBar; for parking
information, ask the SkyBar valet guys.  Please don't park at Kroger's --
they tow!

  Hope to see you there!
