Jeff,

We met at moderators training in Dallas. I saw the announcement that you stepped
down for personal reasons. Please do not forget your forum as they are a great
resource at times like these. If you need an other trusting, confidential ear
please do not hesitate to call me or one of the others you met at moderators
training.

Just a quick note to say good luck and you are not alone.

Norman
