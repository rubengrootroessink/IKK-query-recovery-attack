No, I have never met Tommy.  I think Don &  Shawyn are having some problems ....but Don seemed to be doing well about  it.  We are like old friends and get along pretty well.
 
I miss the hill country terribly!  My  goal/dream is to buy riverfront property on the frio river.  Live in a rock  house and have a guest cottage to rent out.  I miss the trees, animals and  water, stars ....and the nightly bug orchestra!
 
How is Scooter?  I bet Weslie & Corey are  beautiful .  Probably misspelled their names.  So far the teenage  years have not been too bad .  Did you know Lauren lives in Dallas with  Don?  Long story.  I still have custody of her,  she did not  like living in the country.
 
My phone # 713-592-6525 and dinner after work sound  good.  Would enjoy seeing you again.
 
Take Care
Gina

Isn't it a small world.  Did you ever get the chance to  meet Tommy?  He is
a great guy and was the best man in our  wedding.
I'm glad you are back in Houston.  We should try to get  together soon.
Send me your phone number and maybe we could get together  for lunch or
dinner one night after work.
The girls are doing  great.  I bet Lauren is a real beauty.  How is Don?  I
heard  that he was living in Dallas.  Don't you miss Austin?  I would  like
to end up there when the girls are out of school.  We are trying  to survive
the teenage years.  Some days are tougher than  others.  You may know what
I'm talking about.
We are still in  Spring at 25314 Cottage Hill Lane, 77373.  You can reach us
at  281-353-3614.
Take care,
Joannie

   Diane Dickson.  I believe she said she  met you  once at a party?  Until
   the flood in June,  we were next door  neighbors.  She used to live in
    Austin and is a friend of Tommy's.   She now lives on the beach at  South
   Padre.
   As for Lauren, she's doing  wonderful!  She is  a freshman in HS now.
   Taller  than me ...looks alot like Don with dirty  blond  hair.
   I live in Bellaire now just off S. Rice.   Was  living on
   Memorial/Shepherd on the Bayou until the  floodwaters rose past my
   ceiling!  I moved to the Hill  Country Kerrville/Fredricksburg for
   several  years and  came back to Houston last summer.  Sowed more than a
   few  wild  oates there.
   What about you?  Do you still  live in  Spring?
   Gina

   Hello  Gina!
   How nice to hear from you.  Which one  of my  "Austin" friends did you
   meet?
   How is  Lauren?  We haven't seen  you in forever.  Tell me what you  have
   been
   up to and where you are   living.
   Take care,
    Joannie

      Happy Halloween from a ghost of times  past  ...Gina  Pelham .... do
    you
      remember me?  It really  is a  small world.  A friend  of mine,  was
      telling me  about a friend of hers,  ....etc., ....about Austin
    ....Tommy
      ....Shelby .... San Marcos .....a  party.  I was  thinking this
   sounded  
      little familiar and then I   clicked!  I asked her if she knew you
    .....
      she  said she had met you at a  party!   Pretty Scary,    huh?
      So, she just forwarded me your e  address she  had  from one Tommy  had
      sent her in case I wanted to say   .....Boo!
      I hope you, Scooter, and the girls  are  doing  well,  Take  care
       Gina
