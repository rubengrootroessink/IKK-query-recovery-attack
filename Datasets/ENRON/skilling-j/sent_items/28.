The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.
