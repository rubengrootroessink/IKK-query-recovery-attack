Jeff has a meeting right after the building tour, so unfortunately he won't be able to attend.

Thanks,
Joannie

Joannie,

I'm back in town and have everything set for Friday AM at 9.  I am also
going to Hobby Performing Arts immediately afterwards with Paul Hobby and
we'd love to have Jeff join us for a short tour of that job as well.

Thanks,

-Stan
