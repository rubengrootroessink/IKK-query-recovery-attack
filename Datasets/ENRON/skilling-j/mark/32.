Dear Tom,

Thanks for the details.  Do they get letters about articles and, if so, do
you think I will get to see them (not just the ones they publish, assuming
they publish any)?  Can't wait to see what mom sends.  Tell her thanks ahead
of time.  I was able to pull a copy off the Internet, and it was enjoyable
to see my name in print, esepcially in such an important newspaper.  Thanks
again.

Interesting that in same section another article about Itstanbul was run,
and that in my article I mentioned the Hagia Sophia, the subject of that
other article.

Have felt an aftershock or two in the last week, but not the relatively big
one that killed a man.  And what I've felt nothing more than a little wiggle
of the earth.  (If you recall, on the morning of the big one I went back to
sleep, during which I felt lots of them (though again all not much more than
as if a truck went by the building).

Hope all goes well and you are not working too too hard (I know you're
workng too hard).  Hope we get a good bit of time together when I'm in
Chicago.  Maybe we can at least meet for grub on Sunday somewhere in near
your place.
