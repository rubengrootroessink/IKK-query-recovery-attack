Jeff,

Great to hear from you.  Things still fine in my vacinity.  Surkan and
family ok, though of course everyone is afraid, worried and sad.  The big
picture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach several
thousand, the injured over ten thousand.

Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that is
true throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows an
incredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  The
original one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on the
tube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of them
back there.

Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne by
everyone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available to
all but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something this
big in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in some
serious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.

Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soon
and send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, it
was great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about my
life here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.  Look forward to
seeing her and the other kids soon and meeting Rebecca some day.

Say hey to all, take care and write again soon.

Love,

Mark
