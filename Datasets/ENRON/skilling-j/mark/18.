Tom,

Once again good to hear from you.  Still no electricity or water, though
again luckily lap top battery working.  I am also surprised able to get on
line and get through.  Once electricity goes back on will probably have a
tougher time getting trhough.  A bit ironic.

Took a long walk around this morning, crossing the Galata Bridge into Old
Istanbul (my neighborhood can't be called young) and saw little evidence of
damage.  Suspect most of it in new construction areas out on the edge of
this huge metropolitan area, where conrers get cut.  This is a poor country
with a lot of folks struggling just to put the flimsiest of roofs over their
head.

Knock on wood, but think you can all rest easy.  Doesn't seem to be any fire
risk nearby, etc.  Your right about nighttime timing; was on the darkened
deck of a ship in a mighty stormy sea.  CNN says 7.8 or somthing in Izmit
(65 miles east of here)!  I'm on the top floor and had all kinds of images
going through my head, as you can imagine.

More later.  Love you too and looking forward to seeing you in October.

Mark-O
