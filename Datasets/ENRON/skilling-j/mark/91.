Mom and Dad,
I will be sure to tell her.  Any other news?  Will send you an update soon.=
 All goes well. =20
Macedonia surprisingly impressive; green valleys tucked in between snow-dus=
ted mountains, neat farms and villages and not as desperately poor as I had=
 read (at least as this all appeared from the window of the plane).  We hap=
pened to arrive at the same time Secretary of State Colin Powell; the airpo=
rt was surrounded by several helicopters hovering like dragonflies; road in=
to town lined with KFOR (from Kosovo, just 30 km away) soldiers and local p=
olice; we got delayed for 20 minutes or so as Powell's motorcade passed, re=
minding me of a time when I was stuck in a similar traffic jam in Chicago c=
aused by the passing of father Bush.  While there we met with a pimply-face=
d Minister of Transportation and made little progress in our negotiations a=
s deal breaking "collateral" issue came up; I had a nice evening stoll thro=
ugh the old ruins of an Ottoman fort and dropped in on an Eastern Orthodox =
church ceremony (which I found beautiful though a b! it creepy, as the wors=
hipping spaces in their churches are small, crowded with the pious and made=
 to seem further cramped by the smoke of incense and walls completely cover=
ed with icons).  Heard no gun fire or bomb blasts from the nearby hills, wh=
ere recently some Albanian rebels complaining of an absence of political ad=
n economic rights had been trying to mess things up a bit.  I was told by l=
ocal, non-Albanians, that the trouble had been exaggerated by the western p=
ress.  All very interesting.  Details will be in the book!
Love,=20
