Tom,

From previous notes, which I bcc'd to you, looks like I'm "in business".

I've really appreciated your two recent e-mails (as I have all of them).
Had gone to the Tribune web site (something I'd done before, in order to
show my friends here your picture, and brag a bit) looking for info on
percepctive section, but probably due to my bad searches didn't unearth it.
You explanation was very important.  Also important were your comments on
what struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments are
the best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and what
doesn't work.

Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will be
published by "Tom Skilling's" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,
and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), would
never had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.

Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'
newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all to
familiar).

Mark-O

>Now that the rains and cooler weather have come, and the experts have given

>Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the
>official response, that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and
>impressive.  A large truck from my relatively poor, working class
>neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies -- water, bread,
>medicine -- and sent to one disaster site.  The company of one of my

>I recall the criticism I heard after the 1989 San Francisco "World Series"
>Earthquake, which I unfortunately experienced as well.  Though admittedly a

>and complaints could still be heard about the government's continuing
>failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough.

>My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending
>Turkish hospitality.  I could have been left alone, but was not.  When I
>first came here, on vacation, some two years ago, I meet a fine man, Ilyas,
>who makes Saz (a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as

>returned to Istanbul, this time to live, I visited Ilyas again, to say
>hello
>and talk about possible Saz lessons.  When he learned I was looking for an
>apartment, he took most of the next day off and showed me around his
>neighborhood, eventually helping me to find the place I now live.  The
>lessons he eventually gave me were free.  My friend Ismail has spent
>countless hours with me, roaming the city, looking for deals on used
>furniture.  He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug, a blanket,
>and several other very useful items in my apartment.  I occasionally get
>gifts from my students, and never an unkind word from anyone.  After the
>earthquake itself, several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch
>with
>me.
>
>Several days ago, on the television, I saw and heard a crowd burst into
>applause.  A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed
>buildings.  Except for being dusty, he appeared unscathed.  As they carried
>him to an ambulance a reporter followed, asking him questions.  Were you
>scared?  "Cok korktum [very scared]!"  He response was perky.  He was
>clearly delighted to be back in the world, by the attention he was getting.
>Then he was asked about his family.  His eyes grew wide, his face long.
>"Annem [my mother], kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard
>their voices].  Duydum!"  By the time they reached the ambulance, he was
>screaming.  "Sesleri duydum!  Sesleri duydum!"
