Good news,

My article will be in the Perspectives section of this Sunday's Chicago
Tribune.  The Trib's web site is www.chicagotribune.com.  They left what I
sent them largely intact.  I was especially surprised by that, since they
had said that the article would be 800 words, I gave them more than 1400,
and I believe what's getting published will be just below 1300.

I'm very excited, and deeply grateful to Tom.

Love you all,

Mark
