I think this will take about 1-2 hours.  It can be done by phone but in 
person would be better.  I would like to make sure that our documentation is 
clean before we start.  The specs have a lot of discrepencies with the 
drawings, the Bordeaux, and our contract.  Also, I am not sure that we each 
have a drawing of the electrical which matches and conforms to the lists we 
are working on with Bill.  I would also like to see whatever supplement we 
are going to sign to the contract so we can make sure that there are no 
misunderstandings on what is included. I think we have everything worked out 
but there are a lot of players and we all need to be on the same page.  I can 
make time to finish all of this just let me know what your schedule is (and 
Bill's, Joe's etc if they are needed).

Thanks
