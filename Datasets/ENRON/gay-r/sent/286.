Hi Kathleen, Randy, Chris, and Trish,

Attached is the text of the August issue of The Islander.  The headings will
be lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.  A calendar, also, which is in
the next e-mail.

I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.

There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:

1.  I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depot
article.  Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)
is/are.

2.  Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water board
meeting.  I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/22 and July.

3.  Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7
BOA meetings minutes.

4.  Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month.
 They're at 509 Narcissus.

I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move on
schedule!  I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings of
ettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.  (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come to
think about it!)

Please let me know if you have revisions.  Hope your week is starting out
well.


'Nita
