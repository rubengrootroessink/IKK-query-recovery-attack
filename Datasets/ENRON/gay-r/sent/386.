Dave:  my concern not only is with the outage on Sunday, but what may happen 
between Sunday and Tuesday.  With everything else going on, I would hate for 
my group to come in here on Tuesday and have problems on top of everything 
else.  We are going to be having a lot to do and I would feel more 
comfortable without this distraction.  Let me know what you think.
