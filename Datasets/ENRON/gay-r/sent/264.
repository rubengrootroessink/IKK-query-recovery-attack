Subject: Expression of Interest


Rob,

It has been some time now since I forwarded you my resume, and in that I
have not heard back from you, I suspect that your particular group had no
open positions.  I am genuinely interested in Enron, and feel that my
diverse background, experience and education could possibly benefit your
company in a number of capacities.  Therefore, I would greatly appreciate
your assistance in advising me as to whom I should direct my expression of
interest.  Should it go to Human Resources, Department Heads, or perhaps
specific individuals ?

I am attaching hereto, a current copy of my resume should that be helpful in
any way.  Thanking you in advance for your assistance.  Enjoy the weekend.

Bill
