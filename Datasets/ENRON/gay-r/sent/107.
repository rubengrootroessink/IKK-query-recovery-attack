Thanks, Guys

I have just finished reviewing the docs which provide a pretty clear picture 
of  how the negotiations are going.  This looks to be a pretty good outcome 
from a financing standpoint.  I have not explained it to the lenders yet but 
will appraise them that a settlement is in progress and though there are some 
concessions, on balance we still have a strong package.  The one area where I 
would suggest a change is with respect to the way you are handling the noise. 
I would suggest that instead of writing it with no test on gas, just relax 
the requirement to where they have to meet the World Bank Guideline on gas.  
Other than that it looks good but I have a few questions and clarifications, 
so maybe you and Cliff could call when you have a break in the action.  
Thanks

Rob -

 Don't know if you have spoken to the banks or owners eng about the Siemens 
EOT settlement?  Tried to set something up with you on Friday but did not 
hear back.  In any case attached is the latest version of the document that 
covers the issue.  This should not be sent to the banks since we are still 
negotiating with SCC however it gives a good indication of where we are 
going.  If you need more information pls give Cliff a call or I can be 
reached tomorrow in Cuiaba.  In any case next week we plan on closing this 
issue with Siemens and need bank sign-off real time as discussed.
