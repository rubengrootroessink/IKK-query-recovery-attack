Subject: Yabog Amendment - Letter to SIRESE

Find attached the english version of the letter (in spanish) that Transrede=
s=20
sent to SIRESE. 99% of the letter sent to SIRESE reflects Dean=01%s draft.=

Transredes only made slight changes.

Now we are waiting for SIRESE=01%s confirmation to the meeting.
