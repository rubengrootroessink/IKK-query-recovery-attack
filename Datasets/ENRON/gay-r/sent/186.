Subject: Regarding the recommendation letter

Rob,

Last Friday, I learned from an Enron employee who is currently enrolled in 
the Rice's EMBA program that I had great chance to get admitted to the 
program. So I decided not to apply to Yale. If you haven't started working on 
the recommendation letter, please discard it. I appreciate your previous help 
and will keep you posted.

Thanks again.


Blanca,  Thank you very much for your help in the process.


Maggie
