Once again it is our intention to have the $21MM count toward the Budget.  
What is not firmly established is the total budget amount. We are removing 
the contingency which reduces the budget but that is offset by some fuel oil 
expense and F/X expense which is increasing.  Please plan for you and Laine 
to be available Monday AM to make sure we are all on the same page once this 
all settles.

Ok. However, I dont see a reduction from cash from operations in the models 
that were sent to the lenders in August by Roberto. I dont remember either 
Robert or Roberto mentioning this assumptions at that time either. Thanks.

I included cash from operations in the Project Cost Tab in the Consolidated 
Model to match the reconciliation file that Tracee has which will be shown to 
the lenders. If everyone agrees I can send to Shell so they can start 
reviewing, but what Tracee told me was that she and Rob and want to sign off 
first and they are still reviewing the models.

hy are we excludung cash from the lender model.Did we not do this last time.I 
think shell required this. We also need to put on these models that this is 
Enron's latest update and send to shell simultaneaously or get shell's 
approval first( which ain't going to happen quick)
