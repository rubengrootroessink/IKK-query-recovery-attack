Hi beautiful.  Thank you for the pictures.  You look so good.  

I still don't know when I will be able to come to Brazil.  Please write with 
your schedule so I can know when you will be there.

How are you doing? Is school going well?  I am anxious to hear you speak 
english.  I have been thinking of you a lot lately.  

Kisses 

Rob
