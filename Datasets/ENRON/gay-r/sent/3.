Rebecca has set Monday - Dec 4th at 3:00 PM (Houston time) for the meeting.   
Can you all confirm your participation.   And let me know if you are going to 
do the bullet point outlines.   I think it would be good to have this go as 
smooth as possible.

Thanks
Pete

Subject: Cuiaba Review

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete
