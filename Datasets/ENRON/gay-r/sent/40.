I don't know if you heard but I resigned on Friday, but I will be around 
until Feb. 28.  My plan is to retire for a while. I have attached a picture 
of a cabinet I made to give you an idea of how I will be keeping my hands 
busy.  You know what they say - "Idle hands are the devil's workshop".

Beija
