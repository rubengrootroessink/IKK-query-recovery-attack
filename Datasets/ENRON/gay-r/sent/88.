It's getting pricey, especially on the fee side.  But what are the options at 
this point. Peter informs me that we  have been limited on talking to banks 
which pretty much dilutes our leverage.  I also think that the person doing 
the negotiating has no accountability to her clients.  I think you should 
scream bloody murder (perhaps to the new bosses of the region) This is going 
to be a huge drain on the P&L.
