Once again you made my day. You are really a wonderful person, you know?

Don't worry I'm not falling off a cliff - you will hear from me again.  Also 
I'll give you a call before I get out of here next week.

Lots of love,

Rob

Subject: RE: Happy Valentine's Day


thanks for the very sweet message.  You can never be more delinquent than i
since i only mailed your b-day gift a few days ago.  There is nothing worse
than trying to find a gift for a married retiring millionaire. Hence, the
weird gift combination - but i was thinking fishing. Work continues to be
stressfully busy because i'm preparing for a number of trials.  I'm going to
go to Vegas next week anyway bc i need a break.  Thanks for thinking of me -
I'm doing fine. The only time i cried recently was at my arbitration hearing
yesterday - my client's testimony was so touching that i cried (how
embarassing!) - hate when that happens!  It's not the 1st time & i'm sure
not the last.  I know you are very busy during these last few weeks and am
touched that you even had time to think of me.  I thought about you too on
V-day & should have done something special since it probably will not be
possible again. Ok, stop rolling your eyes - you think i'm a flake.  That's
one of the greatest things about you - you are never flaky.  lots of love,
sue

I was thinking of you on the appropriate day but somehow I never managed to
let you know how much I care about you. I'm thinking of you now too and
hope you are happy and doing well.

Love

Rob

thank you for your sweet message.  Greg & i went to Las Vegas for 4 days &
all my sisters & their families were there vacationing at the same time.
We
had a great time.  Came back to work in late afternoon today - tired.
Vegas
was actually my gift to Greg for his birthday which was a wk before mine
but
we celebrated mine there too.  Got your very nice phone message also -
thanks for cheering up my tired mind & body.  Your voice sounds wonderful &
i breathed in all the telephonic kisses.  Hope all is well on the road to
retirement.  love, sue
