There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender 
Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and 
should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered 
lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks 
$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the 
lender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then 
require both OPIC and FMO to consent.

Rob-

I told Richard that I had no experience with IFC.  Suggested that you may 
have.

Peter,

As you might know, we are in the midst of discussions with a group of lenders 
on the Bulacan project in the Philippines. The lender of record if the FMO 
(Netherlands Development Finance Corporation) and the structure is modelled 
on the IFC "A" and "B" loan structure. As the "A" loan lender, FMO is saying 
that they want veto rights over all decisions that are to be taken by the 
lenders. Do you know if the IFC has such veto rights in their facilities - 
will greatly appreciate your feedback on this asap. In addition, does the IFC 
impose prepayment penalties?

Regards,
Richard
