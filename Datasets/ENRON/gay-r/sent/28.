Hi

I'm sorry we missed you at the Christmas Party.  My wife and daughter had 
tickets to a Christmas Play that conflicted, otherwise it would have been 
nice to see everyone.  Things are fine with me, though big changes are in 
store.  I'm really worried about Peter and Brian because they have not heard 
anything yet from anyone about what their role will be.  I should have more 
to say about my situation by tomorrow afternoon.

Cheers
