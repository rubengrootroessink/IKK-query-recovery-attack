Subject: Cases and Assumptions for Fuel Overrun and Furnas Sensitivities Calc

All,

We may need to have some sensitivities ready when we meet with the Lenders 
tomorrow on the ECA.  In preparation for this, Felipe and I running the Bank 
Model for the different cases listed in the attachment below. Please review 
and provide comments on:

(1) accuracy of the Revised Base Case (A1) Assumptions
(2) the likelihood and reasonableness of the various cases
(3) answers to the items noted in Red

Regards,
Tracee
