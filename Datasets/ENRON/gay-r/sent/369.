Bob:  we probably need to get everyone together on this and come up with a 
consolidated stance before we go outside the group.  As you pointed out, 
there are several areas that could open us up to potential problems.  We want 
ot be careful not to get things out in the iopen that we do not want out.  
Thanks.
