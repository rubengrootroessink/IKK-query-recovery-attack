Graham just called back and said that the Rio M&A people were engaged by 
Petrobras to review other Enron asset sales ( I think this implies Elektro 
and the LDC's) and it was only recently that we requested that Petrobras 
consider Cuiaba as well. In any case he assured me that there is a strong 
Chinese wall between the project finance group and the M&A group so it is 
unlikely that they could obtain any info as a result. He assured me that they 
will make everyone aware of the need for increased care on Cuiaba information 
handling due to this situation.  Let me know if you require more.  It is my 
understanding that Neal provided similar reasuarance at your meeting today.

I contacted Graham Lofts and he was shocked and surprised.  He is going to 
look into the situation and get back to me tonight or tomorrow morning.
I will advise when I hear.

Rob- 
Dresdner KB is currently advising Petrobras on their evalution of purchasing 
equity interests in Transredes and the Cuiaba project. As you know DKB was 
also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have 
about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB 
does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease 
all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a 
fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more info
