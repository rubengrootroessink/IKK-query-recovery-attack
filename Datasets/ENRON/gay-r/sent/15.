Chris,

Nancy and Mary took the budget news well.  Their response was "I don't care 
what the number is as long as the sponsors are stepping up for it."
Frank also did not object.  Unfortunately, they are saying that the CCT/CUST 
interconnection issue must be resolved before funding.  Their concern is that 
if we sign then EPE will be subject to third party liability with members of 
the grid.  They are willing to meet with us next week on the budget and the 
ECA but Cliff is not availble until Thursday.  Can you make it later in the 
week?

I'll keep you posted.
