Hi Mike,

Thanks for the update.  Unfortunately, the Civic Club is unable to run the
article in The Islander, because of its political nature.  President Kathleen
Gay reviewed the article, as it was previously written, and advised me last
night that it is against Civic Club policy and bylaws to be involved in
political issues.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kathleen.

Anita Reed
