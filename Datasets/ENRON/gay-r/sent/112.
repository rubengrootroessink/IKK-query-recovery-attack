Cliff,

Can you e-mail me the contract between Siemens and SCC?

Subject: RE: EOT Documents - Siemens Settlement


Laine, Rob and I spoke late last week about this as well.  Given the
impracticality of bank involvement on a short time frame, we determined that
EPE should proceed to negotiate what we believe to be a commercially
reasonable agreement.  We will present the negotiated agreement to the banks
later and deal with them in due course.  Rob, it think, was going to discuss
this issue (among others presently facing the project) with the lenders this
week.  Rob, feel free to chime in if I've misstated anything.

Rob -

     Don't know if you have spoken to the banks or owners eng about the
Siemens EOT settlement?  Tried to set something up with you on Friday but
did not hear back.  In any case attached is the latest version of the
document that covers the issue.  This should not be sent to the banks since
we are still negotiating with SCC however it gives a good indication of
where we are going.  If you need more information pls give Cliff a call or
I can be reached tomorrow in Cuiaba.  In any case next week we plan on
closing this issue with Siemens and need bank sign-off real time as
discussed.
