Thanks.  I have suggested to OPIC/KFW that perhaps S&W should listen in.  
We'll see if they had time to arrange it.  If not we will follow up after.

Regards,

Rob -

 I have not spoken to anyone since we discussed doing this together.  I asked 
John G. to join the call with the lenders tomorrow.

I am going to talk with them tomorrow at 8:30 CST.  You can join if you 
like.  Have you talked to Brad or Sue at S&W?
