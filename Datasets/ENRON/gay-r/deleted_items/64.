 =09 =09    Dear Randy,  The Washington bureau will have a full plate when =
we return from Thanksgiving break.  Congress returns with many lawmakers ur=
ging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington B=
ureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of ene=
rgy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to f=
orce a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll fi=
libuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic Nat=
ional Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next w=
eek.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FE=
RC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commissio=
n announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and=
 small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energ=
y Daily Publisher Llewellyn King has to say about Pat Wood's performance as=
 Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about DOE Secretary Spencer A=
braham - on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's hearing in Washingto=
n.   ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week =
on a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric I=
ncorporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sol=
d to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.   Also, Housto=
n Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Resou=
rces Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring yo=
u details on the final report regarding the chosen route of the Arctic natu=
ral gas pipeline.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.  =
 We'll hear from Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Ex=
ecutive Director John White next week.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak wit=
h White about his organization's opposition to the state's long-term power =
contracts.  Catch White from the West Coast bureau next week.   Closing Pri=
ces for Nov. 21, 2001:   Crude: $18.96       Unleaded: $0.5273   Heating Oi=
