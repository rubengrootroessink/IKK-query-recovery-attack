will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the =
trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tri=
es to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The d=
etails are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions=
 which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce t=
eam (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In =
addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the E=

ate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of =
the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas s=
enior management team.=20
