>I don't know if you received the note below from my dad (I must not have
>given him the pipeline.com address).  Anyway, I'm very sorry to be sending
>this news so late. This month has been a blur.
>
>On the afternoon of Oct 29th, we received the call from our agency that
>our court date was set for Nov. 8th and that we had to leave or Russia on
>Nov. 2nd.  I was out of the office less than an hour after getting the
>call. I've been out of the office since then and I'm just getting caught
>up on email now.
>
>In those three and a half days we had to scramble to complete some last
>minute paper work for the region as well as to obtain plane reservations
>and Visas--not to mention  getting packed.  As it was, FedEx arrived with
>the visas just two hours before we left for the airport.
>
>Our trip went smoothly and we returned on Nov. 14th with our son- Jack
>Oleg Frommelt! He's 13 months old and doing great!  Sarah likes being an
>older sister --except when he gets into her toys.
>
>I had intended to send you a personal note when we received our court date
>but in the rush ... I just didn't get it done--sorry.  Some of our
>extended family didn't even know until after we were in Russia!  I tried
>to call you the night before we left but the number I had didn't work (do
>you have a new phone number or new area code?).
>
>We traveled to the city of Cheboksary.  It is on the Volga river roughly
>between Nizhniy Novgorod and Kazan.  Cheboksary is much less remote than
>Surgut.  Tracy was very concerned about being without bottled water
>(again) but it was not a problem.  We stayed with a host family and that
>was an nice experience.  However, at virtually every point in the trip, we
>thought back to February 1997 and our little group. We also knew that
>Kathleen was with us every step of the way.
>
>I don't have any digital pics to send yet but I'll try to do that soon.

>I hope you and Katy had a wonderful Thanksgiving!  I wish we all lived
>closer to each other.
>
>We look forward to talking to you sometime soon.

>would help guide us to make the right decision.  I know her spirit will be

>Sarah is doing great.  She is 5 and a half going on 13.  This week she
>asked me to explain websites to her.  She loves Kindergarten and we make
>lots of trips too the library.  She played park district soccer for a few
>weeks but it wasn't her thing.  She'd rather climb and swing at the park
>or play with her friends.

>Glad to hear the new job responsibilities are going well! The trading has
>to be exciting. I'll bet it can be exhausting too.  I hope you get some
>time to yourself to re-charge your batteries.  By the way, Enron field
>looks great (even when the Astros are pounding my Cubbies).  It has been a
>difficult year at Motorola but the challenges also bring
>opportunity.  Tracy and I doing well. We just celebrated our 10th wedding
>anniversary--Where did the time go?

>We don't know travel or court dates yet --it could take several
>weeks.  We'll keep you posted as soon as we have any news.
