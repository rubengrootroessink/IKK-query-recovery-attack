Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August 
and beyond.

1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's 
transport to be close to $1 million/ month.

2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her 
here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El 
Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our 
customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.

3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take 
advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very 
difficult time.

4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding 
down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on 
management duties.  

5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day 
off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several 
different jobs at a time.

6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate 
that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million 
to the desk.
