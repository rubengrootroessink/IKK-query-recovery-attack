Could each of you please advise your availability to Blanca Bollom for this 
and Eddy could you coordinate with anyone from outside counsel who you think 
needs to be on such as V&E, Skadden, or Tozzini.

Thanks

Rob
I just realized that Monday is a holiday for  us so we will not be able to
have our conference call then.

We have scheduled one between the lenders and Bob Shapiro for Tues. am.
(2/20).   I propose that we schedule one after that with you, KFW & OPIC at
10:00am Tuesday.    The timing of all of this subject to no conflict with
Frank's schedule, and he is out today.

Let me know if 10am on Tuesday works for you and your team.

Have a good weekend.
Barbara
