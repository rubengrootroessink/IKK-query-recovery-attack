Randy,

Here's my resume.  Thanks taking the time to look over it.  I am very eager
to work at Enron and learn more about the energy industry.  As you can tell
from my resume,  I don't have the typical business background, however I am
willing to learn and thrive on challenging situations.

I have actually interviewed with you before for this type of position, and
look forward to meeting you again.

Thanks again,
Mike Montgomery
