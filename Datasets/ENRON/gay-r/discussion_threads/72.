In preperation for our call, the memo which was requested.  I will also be 
able to brief you on this week's progress with Furnas.  I have a lawyer 
tracing the section reference for the Eletrobras performance guarantee which 
appears as brackets in the memo.  I should be able to advise you of the exact 
reference tomorrow morning when we talk.

Regards,

Rob
