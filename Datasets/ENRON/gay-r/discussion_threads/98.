Subject: Tanslation of Furnas letter

See the translation of Furnas  response of Feb 8.

1) They are not signing the Consent.

2)  Questions the FM claim

3) Raises the need to come up with tariff for a period not initially 
contemplated in the Contract (This needs to be done irrespective of the 
Consent issue)

4) Questions the Economic equilibrium revision if not approved be Aneel 

5) Raises MAE exposure for the project
