Mr. Gay,

My name is Daniel Lisk, your new Gas Scheduler.  I'm slated to begin work on
the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will
be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and
productive career with an amazing company.

I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions
regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to
this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your
convenience.

My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was
mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too
early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -
25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be
very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.

Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.
However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting
that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you
tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane
ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.

Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a
book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior
trader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).  I want to
start contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anything
I can do to facilitate that.  Any other programs, books, push-up and
crunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.

I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday
appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I
can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then
return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?

Thank you.

Respectfully,



Daniel D. Lisk
