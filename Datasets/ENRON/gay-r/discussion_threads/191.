Can you believe this?  We have more red tape than Washington on this.

Subject: Penalties

Stacy Dickson called, and she said penalties for non-performance in the past 
have been handled by supplying information to Legal and they will then write 
a letter to the counterparty stating that per the contract you were supposed 
to deliver X but you didn't perform, so now you owe us $Y.  I asked her what 
she would need to do this and she gave me the following list of items.  
Please coordinate getting this to her - the spreadsheet you prepared may 
already have the volume comparison, prices, and penalty calc in it - we just 
need to get copies of the confirms and contracts.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.

Counterparty Legal Name
Copy of contract
Confirm
Actual Volumes
Prices (prob gas daily)
