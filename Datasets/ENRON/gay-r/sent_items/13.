Randy,  Attached is a screen print from the Sitara audit report.  Are you the "rgay" who changed this price from $2.22 to $2.20 on deal 1021469?  I'm working on the Reliant Energy Services netout for September production and I'm getting a credit for them on this deal because of this price change.  Can you tell if it's valid?  If it is, I'll give them the credit.  If it's not, can you change the price back so this credit will go away?
