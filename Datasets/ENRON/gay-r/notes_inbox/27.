Randy,
   
  The creme jacket has been ordered with the 'E' Logo and  'West Gas 
Logistics' in tan (matching the color of the inside jacket).  
   It will arrive the week of December 11th.  

  I ordered (2) Medium, (14) Large, (1) XLarge, (2) XXLarge @  $155.75. + 
$4.00 (XXL) = $2963.25. 
  Kerri was unsure if they charged tax or if it was included.  She will not 
know the shipping until 
  after the jackets arrive and she receives the invoice.  

   Also, for future reference, I am including the 'guest list' :   )  Heather
