Thanks for the update.  The sooner the better I think; it would be helpful
for us to know what defaults exist as we assess the whole "consent"
situation.

Thanks
Barbara

 Yes, we have not been able to pull Laine and Jose away from their
very
 important activities on the Ridges, the Siemens negotiation and the
Furnas/
 Brazil Inc. efforts.  I think Eddie Daniels is going to try and
start
 pulling the scedule together this week and next.  Thanks for the
follow up.
 Please let me know if the passage of time is endangering this
effort.

 Regards,

 Rob

 Rob
 I forgot to ask you about this this morning: can you  please give me
an
 update on the status of Amendment #2 (the commitment extension).  I
believe
 we are waiting for an update of the attached schedule.
 Thanks
 Barbara
