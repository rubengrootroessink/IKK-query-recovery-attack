He and I talked. You can stop bothering him for now. When we get him next 
week will extract our pound of flesh and we will make him buy the beer.

Rob,

Does this mean Cliff won't be available for our call on Friday or to return 
my three weeks of accumulated voice-mails and e-mails until next week?

If so, I'll stop trying to reach him.
