Pete -

 Starting today 16 December 2000 thru 3 January 2001I will be taking my "home 
leave".  During that time Gonzalo Figueroa will be responsible for operations 
at the plant and Celso Bernardi all financial and administrative issues.  As 
normal Tony Apps has any power plant construction issues and Mel Schulze any 
pipeline construction issues.  Since I will not be in either Brasil or the US 
during my holidays I will not be reachable by celphone.  However Clarissa 
Sauer, my assistant in Cuiaba, will know my whereabouts and how to get in 
touch in case of an emergency.  Her celphone is 55 65 9983-6009.

Happy holidays -

Laine
