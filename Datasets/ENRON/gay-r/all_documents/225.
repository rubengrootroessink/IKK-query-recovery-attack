Here's your link to today's streaming video wrap-up from Williams 
EnergyNewsLive.com. You can view it in one of two formats. We suggest the 
faster connection version for better quality. Use the slower connection if 
you're dialing up from hotel or other remote location.

Faster Connection (100k): http://64.200.168.10/content/daily_wrap_100.asf 

Slower Connection (56k): http://64.200.168.10/content/daily_wrap_56.asf

has to offer here:

Remember, it's all free. Yes, there is a one-time registration page -- a 
necessary, but brief, burden (a requirement since we're providing real-time 
stock quotes) and a quick download of plug-in software so you can use World 
Weather Watch to its fullest. It's worth your time.
