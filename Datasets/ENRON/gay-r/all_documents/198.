I was thinking of you on the appropriate day but somehow I never managed to 
let you know how much I care about you. I'm thinking of you now too and hope 
you are happy and doing well.

Love

Rob

Subject: Re: Happy Birthday


thank you for your sweet message.  Greg & i went to Las Vegas for 4 days &
all my sisters & their families were there vacationing at the same time.  We
had a great time.  Came back to work in late afternoon today - tired.  Vegas
was actually my gift to Greg for his birthday which was a wk before mine but
we celebrated mine there too.  Got your very nice phone message also -
thanks for cheering up my tired mind & body.  Your voice sounds wonderful &
i breathed in all the telephonic kisses.  Hope all is well on the road to
retirement.  love, sue
