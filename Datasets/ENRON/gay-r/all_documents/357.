All - FYI, I would suggest copying this and keeping it handy so you can use 
off-hours when necessary (even though the help desk should do the contacting)


Alex - See me about this. I would like some of this info added to the second 
wallet cards your working on.

Thanks - Bob

Susan,

I am planning to set up an on-call pager and cell phone for Unify Logistics.  
In the meanwhile, please use the following for any Unify Logistics support 
call you may receive:

Seq Name   Home  Pager   Cell
1) On Call Pager    713-284-3757 (not yet activated)
2) Dave Nommensen 281-558-9145 1-888-487-1865  713-562-3986
3) Dave McMullan  281-855-4106 713-285-4982
4) Trisha Luong  281-565-8149 713-285-8715
5) Diane Niestrath  713-682-7416 713-525-0334
6) Benedicta (BT) Tung 281-565-9669 713-285-0931

There are several subsystems within Unify.  The above list is strictly 
related to Unify Logistics.  They are they guys that schedule gas on a 7 X 24 
basis.
This does NOT cover the guys in Unify that do Settlements.

Once I have the on-call pager activated, I will let you know.

Thanks, d.n.
