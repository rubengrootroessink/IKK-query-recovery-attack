Toni:  pending the Cynthia Lara interview tomorrow, I think I would like to 
make an offer to Josh.  I have interviewed him before, and he comes highly 
recommended.  He told me he is currently making $61,000 @ Dynegy, but I would 
like to offer a little less, somewhere in the $57,000 range.  Letr me know if 
you are ok with this, or what concerns you may have.  Let me know.  Thanks.
