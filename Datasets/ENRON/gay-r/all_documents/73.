I am happy to sign but I'm not technically in the ESA chain anymore.  My 
understanding is that Britaldo has assumed this role.  If it will expedite 
things and Ben will accept my signatrure then I can sign. I don't want to 
step on anyone's toes.

Kent, I copied you on this email.

section.  I have tried to complete it as best as I could, please call me with 
any questions (30950).  I need this today please.

Well, it alerts people that we are coming UNLESS we change the name of our 
company (which gives us some protection)

Robert, how long would it take to change the name of Enron Brazil Power 
Holdings XII to say, "Holdings XII"?  Theresa, would that be much effort to 
change our name in our brokerage account?

If it does not take too long, lets change it.  And before we send out  this 
notice, please letJoe and I know the day that is going to be sent (ie, after 
we get the DASH signed etc).

Joe--I have more info coming your way pursuant to your voicemail.

Regards,  Bruce

so selling now (at least restricted now) leaves a nice public audit trail 
that we are exiting the position?

After talking with Bruce about the filing that is required under Rule 144, he 
suggested that I remind you of this requirement as well.  This filing is made 
with the SEC and any exchange over which the shares are traded and is 
available to the public.  It must be filed concurrently with our sell order 
to our broker.  Among other things, the filing identifies, the seller, the 
issuer, the broker, and the number of shares to be sold.  I have gone back 
and confirmed that if we wait the full two years (ie, June 24, 2001), we do 
not have to make this filing.
