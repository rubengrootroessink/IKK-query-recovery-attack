Hi Jamie,

Tried to call you today to keep in touch but the phone just rang. Hope you 
are enjoying Indosuez.  I have announced that I am leaving Enron at the end 
of February when my contract runs out.  With them getting out of 
international infrastructure it is time to move on.  I am going to retire for 
a while and see how the life of leisure suits me.   Give me a call when you 
have a minute (713-646-7582).

Regards,

Rob

Hi guys,

To keep you au fait with my latest adventures, I decided to leave Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson as a result of I what I perceived to be increasing 
uncertainty
on the investment bank's future in the context of its' failed merger(s). So I
have now joined Credit Agricole Indosuez's project finance group here in 
London.
Not quite the outfit of a DrKB but a strong franchise in project finance and a
very talented, motivated team...plus I missed project finance!

My details are now:
Tel. (44) 20 7971 4029
Mob. (44) 7712 76 4343
e-mail: jamie.mabilat@indosuez.co.uk

Hope all is well with y'all. Keep in touch.


Jamie.
