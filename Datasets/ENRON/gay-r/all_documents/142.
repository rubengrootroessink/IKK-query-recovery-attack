I will be out on Th & FRi because my wife is having surgery.  I can't have my 
cel on in the hospital but I will have it with me and will check voice mail 
from time to time.

Shelly Butler with the Associate program HR indicated that by giving Tracee 
the short term employment we will be responsible for her termination package 
at the end of that time (approx. 6 mos or $40,000).  We probably need to do 
some structuring here, no?
