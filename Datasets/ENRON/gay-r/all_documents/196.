I have not been able to find out any details except that apparently he 
decided long ago that he would take some time off after becoming a partner 
and so now he is going to do it.

I have never received a call from Bob Draggon.  Should I still be expecting 
one or have you already convinced him?

Dan Castagnola is being requested as my replacement on Cuiaba and Peter 
Anderson is also being discussed.  I will be involved primarily to provide 
history and guidance, but it will be from my home or parts unknown.  You can 
feel free to call me at any time (281-334-2360).  I will be in the office 
here thru March 1.

Kindest Regards

Rob
