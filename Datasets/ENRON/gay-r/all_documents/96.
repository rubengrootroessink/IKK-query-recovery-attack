Subject: Cuiaba: Release of certain Assets from Loan Pledge

Rob,

I just spoke with Rafael, and he has requested that certain assets be 
excluded from pledge items against the Cuiaba senior loans (EPE and GASMAT).

 All cars and vehicles;
 All furniture and IT equipment,
 All telephone lines 

(Please note that for EPE, the amounts related to those items is around 0.7% 
of the total permanent assets and for GASMAT is around 0.4%.)

 Inventories except spare parts ( 38% of the total inventories).  

(So, we should take out, fuel ( 55% of the total inventories), and  other 
items that are around 7% of the total inventories).


Regards,
Tracee
