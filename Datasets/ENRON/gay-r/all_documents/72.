Subject: Cuiaba Project

I have been informed that Cuiaba I is in Global Assets shop and that I have 
been tasked with responsibility for bringing it to successful closure.

Think there are different definitions of successful closure.   Financial 
close is key step -  gets Enron's money out, but does not improve the 
economics of the project.   I am looking to get as much of Enron's money out 
as possible and improve the economics of the remaining investment.

Cuiaba I is very much intertwined with the GTB/Transredes chain - also with 
Cuiaba II - restructuring of the project is complex - but we have pretty 
clear contractual rights to restructure the supply -  if the Furnas consent 
does not come - poker game becomes very high stakes during January -  and of 
course compounding all this is construction and budget and the mark to market 
position.

I would like to meet with Jose, John, Joao Carlos, Rick, Rob, Laine, 
Christiaan, and Felipe in Houston on the 8th, 9th and 10th (if needed) of 
January to go through this from top to bottom and figure out the game plan 
for how we are going to play these different opportunities off of one 
another. 

Please confirm your attendance -  

Joe/Orlando - if I am missing a key participant - please let me know.

Rob - can you get someone to make copy of the PPA, GSA, and Key financing 
documents for me to read.

Yvette - please get a large conference room for the three days.

Pete
