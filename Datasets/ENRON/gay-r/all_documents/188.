FYI, I understand from John Barquin that he has decided to take a 1 year 
leave of absence from V&E, starting Feb 1.  Cuiab? will be continue to be 
covered by Cliff Rankin and Steve Tarry and the rest of the V&E team.  In 
addition, John will be available for consultation on historical matters as 
necessary.

Regards,
 John
