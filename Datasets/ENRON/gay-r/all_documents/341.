Jana::  I am the manager of West Desk Logistics, and I would like to start 
having analysts rotate into my group.  The gas trading desk director, Phillip 
Allen is also very high on this idea.  Could you give me a call so we could 
discuss?  I would like to get one of the new hires as quickly as possible.  
My extension is 31991.  Thanks.
