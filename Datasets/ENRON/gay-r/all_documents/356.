Subject: Sitara Deal # 96724 Alteration

Hello,

We had trouble calc'ing our BC Physical books yesterday and pinponted it to 
this deal, which had an addition yesterday.
In order to get a calc. we deleted the day from the deal. This of course will 
go back in, and I just wanted to let you know what is happening.
The deal was for 111 MMBTU's; EC - IM Canada BC buying from ENA - IM West; 
the entry was dated 05/24/00 to PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING from PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING 
for a fee of NOVA_AECO-DAILY-US-CGPR...   

I have let Rich Gebauer know about it on our end. 

Have a great weekend.

Brian.
