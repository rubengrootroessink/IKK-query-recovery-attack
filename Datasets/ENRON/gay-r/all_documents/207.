Yes, we have not been able to pull Laine and Jose away from their very 
important activities on the Ridges, the Siemens negotiation and the Furnas/ 
Brazil Inc. efforts.  I think Eddie Daniels is going to try and start pulling 
the scedule together this week and next.  Thanks for the follow up.  Please 
let me know if the passage of time is endangering this effort.

Regards,

Rob

Rob
I forgot to ask you about this this morning: can you  please give me an
update on the status of Amendment #2 (the commitment extension).  I believe
we are waiting for an update of the attached schedule.
Thanks
Barbara
