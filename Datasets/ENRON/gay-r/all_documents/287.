NIce Man! Especially #10

Blowjob Etiquette For Men, From Women:

> >  1. First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it.
> >
> >   2. Extension to rule #1 - So if you get one, be grateful.
> >
> >   3. I don't care WHAT they did in the porn video you
> >   saw, it is not standard practice to cum on someone's
> >   face.
> >
> >   4. Extension to rule #3 - No, I DON'T have to swallow.
> >
> >   5. My ears are NOT handles.
> >
> >   6. Extension to rule #5 - do not push on the top of
> >   my head. Last I heard, deep throat had been done. And
> >   additionally, do you really WANT puke on your dick?
> >
> >   7. I don't care HOW relaxed you get, it is NEVER OK
> >   to fart.
> >
> >   8. Having my period does not mean that it's "hummer
> >   week" - get it through your head - I'm bloated and I
> >   feel like shit so no, I don't feel particularly obligated
> >   to blow you just because YOU can't have sex right now.
> >
> >   9. Extension to #8 - "Blue Balls" might have worked

> >   jerk off and leave me alone with my Midol.
> >
> >   10. If I have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my
> >   teeth, don't tell me I've just "wrecked it" for you.
> >
> >   11. Leaving me in bed while you go play video games
> >   immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable if you
> >   would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.
> >
> >   12. If you like how we do it, it's probably best not
> >   to speculate about the origins of our talent. Just enjoy
> >   the moment and be happy that we're good at it. See also
> >   rule #2 about gratitude.
> >
> >   13. No, it doesn't particularly taste good. And I don't
> >   care about the protein content.
> >
> >   14. No, I will NOT do it while you watch TV.
