Sneak Preview




I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the 
gas line in  connection with the financing. Also on the Interconnection issue 
we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.  We either need to have someone 
riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP 
and make this happen.
