Plz see a summary of the actions items from today's conf call as well as the 
updated version of the decision tree incorporating todays discussions:

Base case will continue to be obtaining project financing and retaining the 
PPA w/ furnas.  However, all parties agree on strategy of acting to keep our 
options open and to this end we will continue to pursue the required steps to 
maintain the default claim against Furnas.  The language for the termination 
letter will be circulated next week and is due to be officially delivered to 
Furnas on the 21st of December.
Owners will be meeting in Cuiaba during the beginning of January to revisit 
PPA and budget strategy and to implement process of monitoring budget on a 
monthly basis.

Plz advise if there are any questions...

thanx,
Jeremy
