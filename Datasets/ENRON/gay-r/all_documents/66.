Thanks Rick,

I too was concerned that he thinks I am pointing fingers.  Although I think 
the people with the authority also ultimately have to accept the 
responsibility, I think Laine has done an incredible job on many fronts 
simultaneously (and I have said so to Mariella when queried).  However, maybe 
this thing is just bigger than all of us. I just don't know any more.   It's 
true there is a lot of pressure and I'm sure Laine is absorbing most of the 
blows.  I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself.

It's true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay 
attention to the flood of e-mails this project generates each day. However, 
as you know, my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually 
find the e-mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights.  It's also 
true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the 
loop (such apparently was the case here).  I think it is unreasonable to 
assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that 
these two young associates can even discern everything that is important.  
They are really struggling with the complexity of this project, everything is 
new to them, and they don't have the benefit of experience to know what is 
normal.  As a result, increased patience and communication are in order.   

At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the 
lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our 
favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position.  I think we made 
great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday, 
although albeit in a painful fashion.  I want to reassure both you and Laine 
that I am committed to getting this done, I no longer have anything on my 
plate but this, and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by  the 
numerous folks nosing around.  The tough projects are what determine what we 
are made of.

I am comfortable with you forwarding these comments to Laine at your 
discretion.

I talked to him after the call and he was concerned about the outbirst. We 
are both getting alot of heat from Corp right now for the overruns . I would 
not take it personal and I do not think he intended the remark towards the 
group on the phone but to others that he has talked to. His only comment to 
me after the call was that he felt he was sending you the info but that at 
times you had not had time to read it. I am not sure this is the case or if 
you even need to read all the notes that come to you but you may want to just 
ask Tracee to automatically forward you everything that you are not copied 
on. Overall- I would not dwell on it .We accomplished what we needed to on 
the call and at least from my point of view I can see that you are truly 
focused on pushing this thing across the goal line.Call me on my cell if you 
want to talk further.

What's up with Laine and the incompetence routine?
