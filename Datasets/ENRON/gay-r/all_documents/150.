We are still pursuing the ownership issue.  I am adding a section to the

Rob- Here are a few comments
Global change: Eletrabras should be Eletrobras
I sent you seperately the GSA strategy paper. I think your captured the main 
objectives> We probably do not want to highlite the VAT objective.I have 
asked fedi to summarise the vintage deal  and answer your other questions on 
Bolivian producers but it is also sumarised in the GSA  paper I just sent you
Are we going to drop the ownership request for now?

John can you give me some feedback on this before it goes.  I am waiting on
