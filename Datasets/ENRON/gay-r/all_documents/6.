Novak and I are still working on it. John's view is that the legal analysis 
provided by Tozzini is not supportable based on the facts of certain regs, 
etc.  We are trying to decide what are the implications so we can advise the 
banks. It seems that we probably do need to assign the agreements.

Subject: Transmission Regulation Memo

Rob,

Your name came up on the Cuiaba taks list call today.  The issue was the 
summary of the ONS contracts issue (who needs to signe ONS contracts... EPE 
or Furnas?).

Have you received the information you needed form Tozzini?  What is the 
status of that memo?

thank you,

Steve Gray
