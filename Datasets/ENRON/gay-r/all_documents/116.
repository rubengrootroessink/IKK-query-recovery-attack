I contacted Graham Lofts and he was shocked and surprised.  He is going to 
look into the situation and get back to me tonight or tomorrow morning.
I will advise when I hear.

Rob- 
Dresdner KB is currently advising Petrobras on their evalution of purchasing 
equity interests in Transredes and the Cuiaba project. As you know DKB was 
also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have 
about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB 
does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease 
all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a 
fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more info
