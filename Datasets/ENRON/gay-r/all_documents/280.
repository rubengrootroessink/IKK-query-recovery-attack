Randy, my oldest son forwarded this to me and based on our political 
discussions at lunch the other day I thought you would enjoy it.

Read this, guys..it's really funny.? The format isn't exactly pretty, but 
you'll be able to figure it out: 
? 

The Real Debate 

Jim Lehrer:???? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice 
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on 
these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question 
and deliver rehearsed remarks 
designed to appeal to undecided women voters. 
The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten 
senior citizens into voting for him. 
When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he 
continues 
to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. 

Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name 
of 
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that 
strains the bounds of common sense? 

Gore:??????????? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly 
made???????????? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of 
our 
rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this 
election. 
My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. 

I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad 
lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who 
is 
here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, 
one 
by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and 
personify problems for me. 

Also, her poodle has arthritis. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. 

Bush:???? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, 
crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity 
exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own 
decisions, 
unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. 

Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan 
Milosevic 
were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able 
to 
pronounce his name? 

Bush:??????? The current administration had eight years to deal with 
that 
guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do 
about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick 
would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then 
Dick 
would tell me which one to choose. 

You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy 
decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. 

Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. 

Gore:??????? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly 
interested 
in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of 
poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian 
War. 
And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper 
in 
a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. 

If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal 
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an 
iron clad lock box. 

Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them 
with 
simple metaphors. 

Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security 
system? 

Gore:??????? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I 
have 
proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to 
every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a 
single 
penny until the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion 
over 
the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs 
delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who 
will 
also help them with the child-proof cap. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? 

Bush:??????? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I 
have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide 
whether 
I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds 
to 
reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. 

Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. 

Gore:??????? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, 
but 
I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning 
the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. 

Bush:??????? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by 
electing no one but Republicans. 

Lehrer:??? Good night.
