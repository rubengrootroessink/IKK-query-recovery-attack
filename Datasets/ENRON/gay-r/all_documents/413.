Randy, 
We are in the process of setting up the following locations in red below in 
EOL as requested by Frank Ermis.
We need to get the pipe , zone (both required) and meter, if applicable, 
commercial would like these locations mapped into Sitara.
In order for these locations to flow into position manager in Sitara 
automatically (instead of manuelly entered) when these locations are hit on 
EOL, 
we need this information. Can you provide this information as soon as 
possible?

Thank you for your help!

Frank would like to see the following 3 Locations approved from trading:

First:

Opal; which is already set up as a Location and is out in DRAFT. Dave, I've 
already asked Frank to have Jeff Shankman look at thh product and offer 
approval. Please review.

Then:

Location: PGT Malin
Abbreviation: PGT Malin
Sort Code: 2850
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission 
Company - Malin.

Location: PG&E Pool
Abbreviation: PG&E Pool
Sort Code: 2840
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas & Electric 
Company - City Gate Pool Gas.

Jennifer; can you check with the logistics guys and make sure these are good 
points and descriptions. Malin Lines 400 and 401 are no longer used, and PGE 
is City Gate Pool Gas.


Frank, if you could review the descriptions also and offer comments I'd 
appreciate it.
