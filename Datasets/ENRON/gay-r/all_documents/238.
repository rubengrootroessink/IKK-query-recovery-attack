Please review the attached message and provide your feedback.  In addition, 
we would like to reschedule the demo with you all as soon as you are 
available.  I think that Heather is checking your calendars.  

Bob-
We did not have the questions below when we met with you last week for the 
demo.  As such, please provide your feedback.  

Victor/Ed-
You received this today in the demo, but here is the electronic version if 
you need it.

We would like to get some resolution on these questions this week.  Please

Subject: ?? Re: KX/UNIFY interface schedule

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are working with Matt Pena and Dave N. re:  KX/UNIFY 
interfaces.  Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to 
release functionality.  Please review and let us know if anything should be 
in a different order.  

As you can imagine, (1)  the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at 
once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible.  
You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it 
is appropriate.  We should target things that give you and your customer the 
biggest bang for your buck.

FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow.

1.  UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX
2.  UNIFY sends psna's to KX
3.  UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX
4.  UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX
5.  UNIFY will "undo" upstream and downstream K#
6.  UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX
7.  UNIFY will "undo" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions
8.  UNIFY will receive psna's from KX
9.  UNIFY will "undo" psna's from KX

Thanks,
Carrie

P.S.  Could we live without #2 and #3?  This appears difficult to implement, 
and we would like to guage the cost/benefit.  

Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all 
other data.  In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to 
be entered into KX for the user to see them.  They would, however, interface 
back to UNIFY once entered.  However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, 
then they would not show up in KX.  Give us your thoughts. . .
