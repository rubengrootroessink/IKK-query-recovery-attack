Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

"The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks."
