Bob:  The problem we were having is that if they could get in, it would lock 
them up for up to 5 minutes and then kick them out.  This would happen over 
and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became 
unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they 
get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a 
problem.  We need to get back to exceptional service so they do not have to 
keep logging back in.  Thanks Bob.
