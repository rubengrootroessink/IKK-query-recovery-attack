Toni:  Debra is a nice enough person, but does not really fit our needs.  She 
did not seem to fully understand what our job would entail, and I had a hard 
time figuring out what she does now.  She does not seem to possess the energ 
y level or the sense of urgency our job requires.  She is clearly not a hire 
from my perspective.  Call me if you need anything else.
