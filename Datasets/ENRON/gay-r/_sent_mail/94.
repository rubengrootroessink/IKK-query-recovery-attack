Bob:  here is our status from this mornings outage event.

NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we 
were not able to EDI, we will have to manually input all successive 
nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify.  
We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as 
they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day 
business will be nominated as an intra-day.

El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% 
of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour 
for us.   

Let me know if you need aything else.  Thanks.
