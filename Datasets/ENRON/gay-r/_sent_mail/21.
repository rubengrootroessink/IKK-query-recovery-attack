Joe,

Late last year Lucy Ortiz gave me your name as the contact regarding gas 
sales under the APEA contract.  I have also been coordinating with Randy Gay 
in our Houston office regarding payments and deliveries.

We have been notified by Coral Energy, representing the City of Glendale, 
that effective December 1, 2000, Glendale wants to receive their entire 
quantity (4,178 MMBtu/d) at the Nova Inventory Transfer ("NIT") point.  This 
point is located in Alberta and will be supplied by Enron's Calgary office.

Can you please notify Chase Manhattan, for purposes of settling the swaps 
associated with this transaction, to settle at NIT for December 2001 and 
beyond, unless another notice is issued to us.

If you no longer have responsibility for managing these issues, could you 
please forward this to the correct person.

Thanks,

Laird Dyer (415.782.7805)
