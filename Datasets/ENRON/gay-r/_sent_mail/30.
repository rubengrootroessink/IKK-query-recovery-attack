Phillip:  the changes I would like to make are to promote Patti to Manager 
whenever you feel the time is right, and then I am going to recommend Stacey 
for promotion to Sr. Specialist based on her recent performances.  I also 
would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the 
people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to 
keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced 
people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
