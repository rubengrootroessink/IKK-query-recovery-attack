Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams 
for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate 
these paths in Unify.  In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity 
between the systems.  Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today 
in 21c2 to discuss.  Please feel free to attend and give your opinions.

Subject: "Auto-Pathing" Buy/Sells

Hello!

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting 
today. . .

Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell 
or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract 
Exchange module?  Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough 
information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?  

In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual 
"re-entry" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?  OR is 
there additional information that you need to create the path that is not 
sitting in Contract Exchange?

This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in 
Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.

It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us 
your input!

Thanks,
Carrie
