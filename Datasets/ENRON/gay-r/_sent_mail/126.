Subject: revision to Path Manager Auto Refresh

Based on feedback from multi-scheduler pipes, the refreshing of paths can 
tend to slow down the other scheduer on the same pipe.  This is especially 
noticeable when many paths are changed at once.  Even if it takes 1 - 2 
seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other 
scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.

We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick 
whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).  To the 
scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace 
the "Auto Refresh" checkbox with two checkboxes:
 - Auto Refresh Deals
 - Auto Refresh Paths
Once selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that 
Path Manager session just as the current selection works.

This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only 
whether another PC should have its numbers updated.  Nominations will process 
all paths regardless of this new selection.

If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify 
Production tonight.  Please let me know if you know of any reason we should 
not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, d.n.
