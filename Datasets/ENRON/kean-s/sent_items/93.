Thank you.  I also enjoyed our discussion very much.  Your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive.  You will be getting a call shortly, if you haven't already, inviting you to our weekend event later this month.  Please come.

Hi Steve,
I wanted to extend my sincere thanks to you for coming to Rice to
interview and recruit. It was so enjoyable meeting you and having the
opportunity to chat about Enron. I had a great experience there this
summer, and I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for a
full-time position. Thanks again for your time.

Sincerely,
Annie
