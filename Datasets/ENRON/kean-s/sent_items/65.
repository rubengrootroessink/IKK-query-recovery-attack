I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go.

Steve and Cindy,

Below is the message I'm intending to send out to the business units about the Management Conference "Home Video" project.  I wanted to be sure you were both comfortable with the direction I'm providing and the topics being proposed.  (Of course, I'm allowing the businesses to generate their own as well.)

As for who is to receive the "challenge," here's a potential list:
Enron Corp.: Rick Causey, Andy Fastow, Mark Frevert, Steve Kean, Mark Koenig, Ken Lay, Greg Whalley
EES: Dave Delainey, Janet Dietrich
ETS: Stan Horton, Dan McCarty
Industrial Markets: Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen
Enron Europe: John Sherriff, Michael Brown
Enron Broadband:  Jim Fallon, Rich DiMichelle
Enron Americas: John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen
Global Markets: Mike McConnell, Jeff Shankman
Enron Net Works: Greg Piper, Sally Beck

(I also intend to cc the memo to all the communication people: Mark Palmer, Gina Taylor, Kal Shah, Eric Thode, Beth Tilney, John Ambler, and me.)

Let me know if you have any changes or comments.  To allow plenty of time to produce these videos, I hope to get this memo out later this week.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, ane even poke fun and laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  Some ideas include:
Accounting Procedures
Cost Cutting
Deal Making
Innovation
Management Changes
PRC
Public Relations
Reorganizations
Stock Price
Trading/Traders

There are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intentions to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be granted for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.  Good luck and happy filming!
