Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.  Some of her work was presented by her colleague and Enron Advisory Council member -- Pankaj Ghemewat.

Professor Amabile,

I work for Enron, a leading energy company based in Houston.  I believe you recently presented some of your research on creativity and motivation to members of our management team.  I am responsible for preparing the business agenda for Enron's annual Management Conference.  Scheduled in San Antonio on November 15-16, the two-day meeting brings together more than 400 Enron executives.

Enron has been named most innovative company for six consecutive years by Fortune magazine.  However, this year has been challenging for the company.  External market issues and internal restructurings have resulted in a depressed stock price and low moral among employees.  

Your insights on creating a motivating work environment and stimulating innovation would be especially interesting at this year's conference.  If you are interested in presenting to our group, I'd like to explore your availability the morning of Friday, November 16.

Please feel free to respond to my email or call me at 713-853-7727.  I look forward to hearing from you.
