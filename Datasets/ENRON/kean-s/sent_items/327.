Please process the following effective July 1:

David Oxley and Mary Joyce base pay increase to 250,000. (Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley's situation with the EWS O of C.).
Mark Palmer (PR) to 225,000. (Note:  I previously asked Mary Joyce to review Mark's position and this is the amount we agreed on).

I would also like to review Shapiro's base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities.
