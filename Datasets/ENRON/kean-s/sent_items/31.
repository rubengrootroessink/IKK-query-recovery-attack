I spoke with Glenn English of the NRECA after our conversation this morning.
Of the dates you are available for a meeting in DC, September 20th works
best for him. Either Mike Steffes, ACES VP Trading & Marketing, or I will
also attend. 

Please confirm and let me know what time and place is best for you. 

Thanks again for taking the time to visit with me this morning.

David
