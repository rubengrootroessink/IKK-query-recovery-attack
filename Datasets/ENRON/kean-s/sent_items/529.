Thanks so much.  As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.  I will be in touch when the time comes.

Steve, I realize that all of you are under enormous pressure and stress, coupled with a lot to do.  If I can be of assistance in any way to our department or any other, i.e. research, preparing documents, etc. please don't hesitate to let me know.  Just tell me what to do, and consider it done.
