I think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes.

Management Changes

Let me also update you on some recent management changes that reflect the broad, deep team that we have at Enron.  

Lou Pai, former Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, is no longer with Enron, and we thank him for his years of service.  Tom White, who had served as Vice Chairman with Lou, accepted the position of Secretary of the Army. 

Dave Delainey has taken over as Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave is extremely well prepared for this new role, and we look forward to investors getting to know him.  Seven years ago, Dave joined Enron Canada, where he led the growth of our Canadian business, then led all our North American origination activity and most recently ran our entire North America wholesale business.

Many of you know Kevin Hannon, who had been president and COO of our broadband business.  Kevin is now CEO of our global asset operations, which includes all our assets and activities outside of North America and Europe. 

Jim Fallon was recently named President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron Broadband Services.  Jim was instrumental in developing Enron's power marketing business.  For the last year, Jim has been responsible for all of EBS' domestic and international bandwidth intermediation activities.
