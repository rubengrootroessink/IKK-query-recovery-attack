[Kean, Steven J.] I'm copying Karen ... thanks for the heads up.  My view is we probably won't want to expend resources or Ken's time on this right now.  It looks like a story that can wait a bit.

Cindy  Thanks.  Let me give you a heads up.  You may be called by Bruce Nichols of the Dallas Morning News/ Houston Bureau.  He is an old friend and probably the best reporter in town.....and a big Ken Lay champion.  He's doing a story on the impact of Ken's current intense involvement in the company on his civic leadership.  The question is whether or not Houston was losing Ken's leadership because of his current Enron involvement.  My response obviouly was that the community benefitted greatly from his leadership during the many years that he served as the CEO, so the current situation is familiar territory.  I gave him your name because of your role.  Bruce is very supportive of Ken, and attended the press conference a couple of days ago.
 
Bob

Cindy--- look forward to seeng you today, although I will be a little late. The funeral for Bob Braden is this morning.  Bob chaired the Greater Houston Chamber, and of significance to me personally, Rice Center.  
 
We discussed Enron's representation on Central Houston's board.  Alan likes very much the Greg Whalley suggestion; so please go with it.
 
New adds to the board include:
Fred Burns, Chairman, Wortham Foundation
Jim Flores, Chairman & CEO, Plains Resources
Bob Harvey, Vice Chairman, Reliant
Bob Onstead
Al Bledsoe, Managing Partner, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (Al served previously in his Coopers capacity)
 
Pending (as soon as their companies join) are Jim Hackett, Chairman & CEO, Ocean Energy, and Mike Morgan, President, Kinder-Morgan.
 
Good luck with Greg; I am available on a moment's notice to meet with him.
 
Bob
