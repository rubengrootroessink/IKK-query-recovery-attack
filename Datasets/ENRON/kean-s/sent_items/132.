Hi  Steve,
 
I was wondering if  you would have 30 minutes to meet with me sometime in the near future for  confidential reasons. You asked me on Monday if everything is "all right" and  the answer is "not really." I request this meeting for personal reasons, more on  mentor basis, than employee to employer. 
 
Would that be  possible? If so, I would also request that we meet early in the morning, or on a  conference room on another floor. It is difficult to meet on this  floor without everyone immediately knowing/questioning your intentions.  
 
Thanks for you time,  Margaret
