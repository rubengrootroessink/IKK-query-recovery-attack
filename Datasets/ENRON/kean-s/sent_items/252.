On Monday Jerry will take a leave of absence from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University to join the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as Deputy Director in the Office of Policy and Planning.  In his role Jerry will focus on how government policy inhibites competition.  He anticipates looking closely at state electricity policy and testifying and writing policy papers in this regard.  (Lisa, he could be of help with some of your issues as well.)

Jerry does not know his new phone number, but he can be reached this week at Mercatus at 703-993-4923.  His current work e:mail jellig@gmu.edu should work for the transition, but for insurance also send communications to him at jellig@yahoo.com.
