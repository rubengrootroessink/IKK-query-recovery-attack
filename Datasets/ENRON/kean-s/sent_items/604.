		Subject:	Algebra Information

		Dear Algebra Students,

		You successfully completed Trimester I, and we're headed
into Trimester II. As I'm sure you've already noticed, the material is
getting more and more challenging. You should also be aware that I will
be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses.
The Unit 4 Test is a good example of the thinking skills that I'd like
to see. The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and
required that you apply what we'd learned. Although the class average
was 73 on this test, and many of you scored lower than you normally do,
I think that we have to give ourselves credit for "passing" such a
challenging test. The best news is that your portfolio grades will more
than make up for a lower test score. One might say that I even planned
it that way. :-) Now, we have to get ready for the next test. It will be
a similar test in style and difficulty, and we won't be doing a
portfolio. So, you should take the Unit 4 Test and study the type of
questions that you missed. Don't worry...I know you can handle this! By
the end of the year, you will be a superb test taker and algebraist!

		PS: Don't forget to discuss your Unit 4 Test score with
your parents. They had to take challenging tests in their day (:-)), and
they can help you prepare for the types of questions (even if they've
forgotten some of the math).

		Mrs. Ward
