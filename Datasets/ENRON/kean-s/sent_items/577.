Hey gang --
 
I forgot that, after rescheduling three twice due to the events of the past month, Teresa scheduled a meeting for 9:30 this morning with our financial planner.  As a bonus, I'll bring you back his best tips for 401K manipulation in light of our present circumstances!  If I'm needed -- particularly since I sprung this one -- please feel free to call me on my vibrating cellage.  KD -- if I'm needed critically, call.  I can skip if I have to.  I'm getting ready to slam out some more A's for Mary's long list of Q's and hope to focus on that a great deal today.
 
Q: Will Enron senior management lose their bonuses, go to jail, apologize publicly, sit naked in a dunk tank at the next ECafe, donate their life savings to the United Way, and resign immediately?  Also, what happens to Starbucks?
A: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.  On the first one, our review of the situation is underway and no decisions have yet been made, but we welcome your suggestions.  On the second one, beverage service issues will be part of the transition team focus.
