Subject:=09Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site an=
d team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to=
 build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that=
 require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far=
 more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleague=
s might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire we=
ek for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Na=
turally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wro=
ng time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which comp=
ounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2=
, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the tra=
vel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international e=
mployees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be in=
cluded in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizat=
ions, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expe=
nses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In =
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform =
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the foll=
owing will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial an=
d non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must b=
e communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified=
 include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the =
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefe=
r that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that=
 is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work=
 is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to=
 justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So pleas=
e pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown
