I think we should shoot for Tuesday (after the written info is released Mon).  I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.  Here's what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday's written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.  I also think it needs to be a call not a webcast.  What do you think?
