Mike -

American Airlines flight 587
New York, NY Kennedy (JFK) to Sano Domingo, Dominican Repub (SDQ):
Travel Agency in the Park - No passengers booked 
Ayscough (London Based Travel Agency) - No passengers booked
I am waiting for confirmation from Vitol, Navigant & Travel Management Consultants.  

Due to the closing of NYC bridges and tunnels, I have also requested a passenger name listing of any employees currently in NYC.  I will forward this report to you soonest.
