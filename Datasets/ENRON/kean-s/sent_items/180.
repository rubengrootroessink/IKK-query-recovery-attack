Subject:	FW: Request for PR2 Access

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Jo Ann,
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in the group 7/16)
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   

I hope this "pleads our case" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. 

Thanks,
Deana
