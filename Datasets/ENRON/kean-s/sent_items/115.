I understand you are working on a "test" of our evacuation procedures.  I am very concerned about this given the density of our floors in our old building and also, given the amount of people we have in the new building, with its on-going construction.  When are we going to have a "drill " of some kind--the sooner the better for our employees peace of mind. Thank-you,  Beth
