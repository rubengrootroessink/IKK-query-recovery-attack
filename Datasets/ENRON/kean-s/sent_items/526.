Shankman told me tonight that the additional piece that makes up the difference between the 3.2 and the 4.4 has not been irreversibly committed to, so we don't have to pay.

Steve - FYI

Bridget's spreadsheet shows $3.2 million paid.  At an August "Art Committee" meeting, Lea indicated $4.4 million committed to date, i.e. may be some large invoices outstanding.

I'm working with Jeff Shankman to contain.   - Bill
