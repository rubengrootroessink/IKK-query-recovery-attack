Dear Parents of 8th Grade Students,

I am now emailing you as the Social Justice teacher (my second hat).
Currently, your daughter is not taking Social Justice. Since I would not
be seeing you (as a Religion teacher) during Open House, I wanted to
provide you with my handout and classroom procedure sheet. I'm also
attaching information about the major project.

 <<Social Justice Overview 01-02.doc>>  <<Procedures 01 SJ.doc>>  
<<Current Event Project.doc>> 
:-)
Mrs. Ward
