Mary -- After discussions with Meg, I am requesting approval for the following access that we are modifying from the original request.

JAMES COLLINS - No action necessary.  Currently has HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP.
KATHY ABSHIRE - Requesting approval for original request of HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP.  Needed to perform audits of Personic Users access to keep in sync with SAP active users and serves as backup to James Collins in administering the enterprise-wide employee referral program.
THERESIA JAMES - Requesting approval for original request of HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP with an expiration date of  9/15/01.  The tasks she performs will be transitioned to the OLER group at which time her access will be removed.

If you agree, please note your approval and return to me.  I'll consolidate both outstanding requests and forward to Steve.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
