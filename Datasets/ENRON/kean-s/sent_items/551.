Subject:	Draft of Worldwide email message re:  Certification with Code of Ethics

Dear Steve, Jim and Paula:

I recommend the following message be sent to all employees worldwide:

	"As you know, Enron has adopted certain policies, with the approval of the Enron Board of Directors, all of which are set forth in Enron's Code of Ethics.  At this time, I ask that you carefully read the policies and submit your statement of personal agreement by Friday, November 16, 2001.  

Use your SAP id or GIS id (global employees only) and certify your compliance at http://hrglobal.enron.com.  In addition, please be sure to include any exceptions to your certification.

The Code of Ethics is available for your review on the Enron Home Page at http://home.enron.com.

We're proud of Enron and we strive to maintain a good reputation.

Thanks for your help in making this happen."

Please tweak the language as you see fit.

Thanks.

Sharon
