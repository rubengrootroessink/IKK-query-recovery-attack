We are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc.  Terrie James is working with Ken on speakers.  It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today.

Any more progress on the Management Conference?  Are you running with it?  I really think we need a more conservative
challenge than "Becoming or renewing our pledge to be the World's Leading Company".  It just doesn't ring true
with our employees until we get the share price moving back up.
