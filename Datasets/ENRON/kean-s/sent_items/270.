Washington Journal


	As a valued member of the RFF Council, we thought you might
appreciate knowing that Resources for the Future President Paul Portney
has been asked to appear on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" this Wednesday
(August 15th) between 8am and 9am for a live, hour-long interview.

	It is a unique and unprecedented opportunity to enlighten a
national television audience about RFF itself - its mission, research,
history and future goals, much of which you have helped to support.

	C-SPAN's request for the interview followed intense media
coverage of Dr. Portney's work chairing the National Academy of Sciences
committee on fuel economy standards, and Katherine Probst's
widely-reported study on the future costs of Superfund.

	You can also access the interview online at www.c-span.org and
click on the live TV/radio programs icon at the top of the page.

	Thank you.

	Russell M. Ray
	Assistant Director, Development
	Resources for the Future
