In an FT article today it says that:

?	The quality of earnings at Enron has deteriorated
?	behind the scenes financial engineering has increased
Therefore the overall standing of Enron in Wall Street has plummeted.

How do you envisage changing this perception of Enron and change investor sentiment towards the Enron stock.
