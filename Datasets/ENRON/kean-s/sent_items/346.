I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense.

Just wanted to pass this along.  It's good to know he is alright.

With someone like Mr. Foster so nervous about air travel, do we need to consider alternative travel options for our VPs?  I'm assuming a lot more will chose to drive from Houston to San Antonio -- I know I will this year.  The idea of chartered buses from Houston to San Antonio surfaced, but I expect most who opt to drive will want control of the time they leave and return to Houston and arrange a small carpool.  What are your thoughts?

Terrie, a warm thx to you.  We are, thank God, all OK here, both family and
friends.  Friends of friends were badly hit however, and that hurts all of
us.  NYC is a different place today than a little more than a week ago.

As long as you are sending the plane I am coming.  Frankly, without the
plane it would be a tough decision to make.  I find that most meetings
requiring travel these days are getting canceled.  It is one thing for an
individual to fly, it is another thing for an a father or mother to leave
spouse and children at home.   That is very hard to justify at this point.

Thanks for your concern and kindness.

Dick

Dick (and Heidi),

I wanted to check in and make sure you were okay after last week's
tragic events in NYC.  As we move forward with plans for our Management
Conference, let's discuss arrangements for you.  Given the uncertainty
of air travel, we are extending use of our corporate jets to our
speakers.

Hoping you are well,
Terrie James
