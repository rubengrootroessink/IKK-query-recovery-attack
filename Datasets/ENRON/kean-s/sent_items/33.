Just an observation and suggestion regarding the recent media blitz --- Make sure employees have access to Enron's side of the story via (additional) eBiz features or an e-speak feature with the Office of the Chairman when the 3rd quarter earnings are released.

I hear people talking about some of these articles (like the NY Times article this weekend and the Off Wall Street article a few weeks ago) and they don't know what to think.  The general employee population does not understand our financials and how Enron "makes markets". - At least this is my perception based on conversations that I hear in the elevators and on the bus on my to/from work.  

Anyway, my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside.
