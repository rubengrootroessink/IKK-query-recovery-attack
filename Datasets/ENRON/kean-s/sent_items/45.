Thanks for the inquiry.  We do not have an interest in sponsorship.

Dear Mr Kean,

In follow up to the recent email sent to Enron seeking the company's
interest to participate as a sponsor in the WTO Forum next March, I haven't
heard back from you and as events in the US have overshadowed any business
decisions last week, I thought it prudent to wait until now to pick up my
correspondence.

With WTO now certain for the PRC, I am hoping that you may have reviewed the
proposal sent and discussed it amongst the appropriate people within Enron
and at least have a preliminary view on interest at this point.  I would
certainly be happy to follow up on any further questions or information that
you require.

Kindly advise at your earliest convenience as to the next step in the
process of consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Theodora Thunder
