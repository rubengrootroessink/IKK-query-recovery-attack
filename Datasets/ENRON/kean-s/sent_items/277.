See below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.

here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
pollster for President Bush:

Gray Davis

FAV             48
UNFAV	       44

STRONG UNFAV     28
STRONG FAV          15


RIGHT TRACK         34
WRONG TRACK      49


DAVIS  		40
RIORDAN          39




Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
situation politically.
