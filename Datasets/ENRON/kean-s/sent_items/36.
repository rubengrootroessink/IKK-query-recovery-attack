In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.

	Our best information is that the CPUC will NOT VOTE on direct access tomorrow, but will continue the meeting to another date and time.  Will let you know when we know the new date for the meeting.
