--Steve- Did you get my earlier email re: this last week?

Ken


I found out at a meeting last Wednesday from an employee of another department that my title had changed from Manager to Sr. Specialist in the Expertfinder. I returned to the office and found this to be true. I called Joann Hill in Corporate HR and met with her on Friday. She advised me that there had been a study which re-classified several of us on EPSC. We were not informed prior to this happening. I was further frustrated because when I was transitioned to this department in April . I met with Bill Donovan and Lou Casari and was told that nothing would change about my title or responsibilities. EBS would be my primary client and I would be charged back 100%. When I was transferred my team was assigned to managers already in the department. I was not told that my title was in jeopardy. I am still responsible for Julie Stockham as a report in Portland although she is in Phillip Lord' s cost center. Joann was very gracious and agreed to investigate and let me know.

This is a setback I had not anticipated especially after John Echols ad advised me I was next for promotion

Thanks for your support.
