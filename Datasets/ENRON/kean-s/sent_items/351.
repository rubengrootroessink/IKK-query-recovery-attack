I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.

I'm OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.  we may not get much response now.  We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference.

Steve, Mary and I are ready to send out an email to the potential executive sponsors of the ThinkOut.  Please review the memo as soon as possible, and let me know if you have any changes.  Thanks so much.
