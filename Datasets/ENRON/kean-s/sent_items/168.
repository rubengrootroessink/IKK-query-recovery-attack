Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know.
