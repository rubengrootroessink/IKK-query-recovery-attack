Thanks, Jeff.  We have already retained a crisis PR firm --Kekst and Co.  They have been working with us for the past few weeks.  Feel free to mention them to Chase.

Rick,
As the press seems to be turning worse, I would strongly advise Enron to call George Sard of Citigate Sard Verbinnen at (212) 687-8080.  George is probably the leading crisis communications advisor in the world and could offer them great counsel, especially in distributing and managing the current press release.  We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation.
Hope that's helpful.
Kristin
