I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for. 

 I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.

Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.

Steve, Mike and Mark,

As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).

The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.

Thank you,
Catherine
