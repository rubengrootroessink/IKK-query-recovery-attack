A couple of clarifications:

The $800 million of proceeds from asset sales does not include Azurix NA ( that cash goes to Azuirx, not Enron).
PGE sale - not $2 billion in PS;  $200 million in PS and $50 million in common stock
The investor call was extended to 8:30 t0 10:00 am and will focus more on the current business and financial stituation at Enron rather than the 8K filed last week.

Questions of the Day

?	Liquidity and counterparty activity.  Transaction count on EnronOnline (media and investors)

For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of 5,800 transactions with a notional value of $2.7 billion. 


?	Quantification of litigation (media and investors)
o	no specific comment on litigation
o	shareholder suits likely to be consolidated
o	$3.5 billion "basket" in merger agreement is designed to cover all Enron litigation (i.e. not just shareholder litigation) and the parties believe this will be sufficient

?	Ken Lay's compensation (media and employees)
o	Ken, like many CEOs, has a change in control provision in his contract (and has had one for many years)
o	Ken has elected to waive his right to payment under that provision


Messages of the Day

?	Impact of merger on asset sales transactions (e.g. Dabhol) (media) 

Enron will continue with our asset sales program as previously announced.  Those asset sales that have been announced include EcoElectrica, CEG/CEG Rio, EOGIL and Portland General Electric, as well as Azurix North America, which closed on November 7.  These transactions total $800 million plus PGE ($1.55 billion cash, $2 billion in preferred stock and $1.1 billion in debt)

?	Timing of funding from Chevron (banks and rating agencies)
o	Obligation - 3 business days after filing HSR (expected today), expect funding to occur earlier

?	Impact of transaction on specific areas (e.g. Portland, Japan, Florida and other office locations) - case by case
