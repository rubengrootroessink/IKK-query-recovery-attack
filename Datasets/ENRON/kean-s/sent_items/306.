We are responding.  I'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who's burning out?

Steve,

I work in ENA producer finance (Thompson and Josey's group). Glad to see you are keeping the world at bay.

I quickly picked up my copy of Red Herring yesterday to read the Enron article. Their insight into Enron or lack thereof aside, I assume you will respond to the price gouging assertions which they prominently feature on page 21 (LEADER). Perhaps this has occurred already, if so, thanks.

Interesting that we had Tony Perkins speak to us last November in San Antonio. 

Thanks
