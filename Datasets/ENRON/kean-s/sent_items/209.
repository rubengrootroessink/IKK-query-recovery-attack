My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading.

Subject:	Comments on Judge Wagner's Proposed Recommendation   

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah
