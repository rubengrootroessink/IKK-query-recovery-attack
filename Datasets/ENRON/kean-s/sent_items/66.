For your information.  Should Ken respond to the reporter?

Dear Mr. Lay

I am a reporter with The Asian Wall Street Journal and I understand that you
have written to the Indian Prime Minister to complain about the Indian
government's lack of co-operation regarding Dabhol. Is it correct that Enron
is now threatening to sue the Indian government, MSEB and GOS for a total of
US$ 4 bn to US$ 5 billion ?

I am very interested in pursuing this story given the lack of action by the
Indian authorities and wonder if you would be kind enough to verify that you
have indeed sent this letter to the Prime Minister

Thank you for your help, Sara Webb
