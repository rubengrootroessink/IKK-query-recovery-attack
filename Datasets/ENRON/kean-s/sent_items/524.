My follow up question on the pay would be: did McMahon or any members of the board receive any form of compensation in connection with these entities, even if this compensation did not come from the entities?

Answer: No

Peter, you are free to say that we did not provide responses to your other questions. Your last article acknowledges the fact that your inquiries are based on information supplied by entities suing Enron.  We do not comment on litigation.
