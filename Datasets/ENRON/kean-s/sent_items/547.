Thanks for thinking of us.  We have retained a crisis communications firm  -- Kekst &CO. -- to assist us.  They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken.

Mary Beth - I thank you your e-mail.Although I?m part of the special
committee,everything related to the company we
defer to them.
As so, I?m including Steven Kean on this e-mail, because he is the one in
charge, among other things, of  PR.
Best Regards,

PFerraz
