In my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.  Please review and approve John's.  Please check on mine:  they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.  It may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once.
