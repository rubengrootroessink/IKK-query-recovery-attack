Hello Steve,

I left Mike Hicks a voicemail message yesterday.  

TAP (US & Canada), Navigant (Nepco, Seattle) Vitol (Domestic), Ayscough (London), Imperial Tour (PGE, Portland) and Travel Management Consultants (EES, Chicago) confirmed that we did not have any employees booked on flight 587.  

Eight (8) employees were identified with reservations to leave New York yesterday.  They were all contacted and ultimately able to proceed with travel plans.

Please don't hesitate to phone me directly if you have any questions.

Mike -

American Airlines flight 587
New York, NY Kennedy (JFK) to Sano Domingo, Dominican Repub (SDQ):
Travel Agency in the Park - No passengers booked 
Ayscough (London Based Travel Agency) - No passengers booked
I am waiting for confirmation from Vitol, Navigant & Travel Management Consultants.  

Due to the closing of NYC bridges and tunnels, I have also requested a passenger name listing of any employees currently in NYC.  I will forward this report to you soonest.
