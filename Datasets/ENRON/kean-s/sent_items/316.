I think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now.  But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.  We should be positioned for a great period of growth.

I was watching the meeting from my desk.  If my question was asked and answered, I missed it and apologize for asking again.  This is a question that is traditionally asked at these meetings :

Ken,

Where do you think the stock price will be at the end of the year?
