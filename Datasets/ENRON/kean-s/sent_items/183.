=09We have completed the inspection of the GAA line to LaPaz, and everythin=
g looks OK.  We'll reinitiate gas flow tonight.  OSSA II should be complete=

=09I'm going to keep things in emergency status until at least tomorrow, af=

=09Subject:        17/7 - 7:00 p.m. - Update: Emergency=20

=09The situation continues to be stable.  CLHB has reinitated LPG operation=
s to LaPaz, but continue their inspection.  TR will not reinitiate gas or c=
rude export operations until we have completed our inspection.  We have for=
med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.  It=
 could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we =
get a progress report in the morning.   All crews available systemwide are =
mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority co=
ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano.  The three stations in the altipl=
ano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.  Other supervisors throughou=
t the system have been advised and are on alert.

=09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and =
inspection action plan.  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (t=
he regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute ene=
rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz=
's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in=
spection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L=
aPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide =
only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

=09We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received =
inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia=
ns this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system=
.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to th=
e volatility of the issue in LaPaz.  Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed w=
ith the message.

=09We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack=
 should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.  =
In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a=
 notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s=
afely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne=
cessary.

=09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol=
utionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.  Morales has had co=
ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we'=
re still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, o=
r if it is against government.  Morales has just joined forces with another=
 rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro=
w.  Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as=
 a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, proba=
bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.  The po=
litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int=
erests looking to fill the leadership void.  We're watching this situation =
closely.  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for =
at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational si=
tuation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

=09At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li=
ne in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.  Our OSSA II (crude ex=
ports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely=
 have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had=
 a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  Th=
e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediat=
e threat neutralized.

=09However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 day=
s of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and =
will notify the Enron Crisis team.

=09We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized =
a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw=
ork.  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o=
ut in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power=
 fuel supply.  I've notified all relevant government authorities of the sit=
uation, and so far am getting support.  I've also asked the Embassy to look=
 into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of a=
n organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be =
helpful.

=09Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations th=
roughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perf=
orm vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.  Until=
 and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano,=
 we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.  We will kick off=
 the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our =
people complete the overall plan.

=09I will keep you posted as things develop.=20
