I believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?

Steve,

Any luck finding anybody from Enron to come and talk on October 18 at the 
HBS/IESE executive program I mentioned to you?  Thanks for your help.
