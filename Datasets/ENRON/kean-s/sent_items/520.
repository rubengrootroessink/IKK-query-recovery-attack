Tiffany, this the list of executives and directors who should receive a copy of Fortune's Most Admired Companies survey.  To assure that these individuals get the survey, we ask that you send all the surveys to us and we will distribute them.  This is especially important when dealing with our board members.  Call me if you have any questions, and thanks for working with us on this.
