Subject:	DRAFT MEDIA STATEMENT RE: KLL COMPENSATION
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.


Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.
Karen
