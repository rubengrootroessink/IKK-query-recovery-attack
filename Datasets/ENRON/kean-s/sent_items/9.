thanks so much for the note.  I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.  My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.  I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I'll be glad when this one is over).

Steve,
I am very disappointed to learn that you will leave the company.  I remember you as that real go-getter who learns new words each week.  During our trip to Dubuque, the word was "elect" and I have elected to adopt that term many times since.  You have remained a bright light to me as I followed your success.  I am saddened that you will be some place else.  But you will always be a friend.
