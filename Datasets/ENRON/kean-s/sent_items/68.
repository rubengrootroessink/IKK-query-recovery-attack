I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.  

As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.


There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.

I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks.
