I will be out of the office until September 4. 

If you have pictures to send, please email them to nytpix@nytimes.com. Don't use the ftp site while i am away. 
If you have messages for the foreign picture editor in my absence, please send them to foreign@nytimes.com

I will check my messages when I return.

Thank you.

Cecilia

I will not be reading my mail for a while.
Your mail regarding "FW: Reply to Paul Krugman's column (Enron Goes Overboard, August 17)" will be read when I return.
