I'm meeting with Jerry Patterson today.  He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.  Jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that Ken has made a personal contribution.  Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.  Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution?
