thanks Anthony.  It's difficult to see so many smart, hard working people i=
n the kinds of circumstances you describe.  Unfortunately, I'm going throug=
h some of the same things (on a smaller scale).  We are having to let peopl=
e go in my organization.  I simply don't have room, even for a qualified pe=
rson like Maurice.
Does Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?  If so, perhaps the=
re is an opportunity there.

Steve and Rick:  You may have heard that EBS is winding down its business i=
n the Asia Pacific region.  This is, of course, greatly disappointing for e=
veryone involved but is the right thing to do given the status of the indus=
try here.  We have a great team in the region and I am trying to help membe=
rs of the team find new homes in Enron.  Along those lines, I wanted to bri=
ng Maurice Nunas to your attention.  Maurice joined EBS this past June and =
is Director of Government Affairs for the region.  We were fortunate to lan=
d Maurice from Motorola in Singapore.  Maurice is a recognized expert  on t=
elecommunications regulations in Asia, and has excellent working relationsh=
ips with a number of governmental bodies and NGOs across the region.  In a =
short period of time Maurice has made significant progress on a number of g=
overnmental and regulatory issues that were facing us in the region.  He ha=
s proven adept at picking up the fundamentals of the Enron business model a=
nd has skills that would transfer across a number of commodities.  Maurice =
is interested in staying with Enron and working in Houston, elsewhere in No=
rth America or in the Asia Pacific region -- since he is new to Enron and d=
oes not have extensive relationships around the organization I thought I wo=
uld forward his cv to you as you are in a superior position to know what th=
e various business units' needs may be.  Thanks for your consideration -- p=
lease feel free to forward Maurice's resume or to let me know what I can do=
 to further his placement in Enron. =20

I hope all is well with both of you.  Regards.=20
