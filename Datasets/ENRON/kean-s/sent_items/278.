I left a message.  Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys.

Steve, I gave this fellow your phone number if he decides to call.  Would you like me to route these somewhere else?  It was all I could think of late last evening.  (I should have already forwarded our phones to voicemail!).

Ken,

Rosa Lee indicated that e-mail would be a great way to initially communicate
with you regarding the announcement during the Astros pre-game show that
your CEO stepped down today.

When you are ready to evaluate your options to staff the position, my CEO
and I would like to meet with you to discuss Allen Austin Lowe & Powers'
capabilities to do a thorough retain search for this position.  Two salient
points are: 1) We have filled 100% of our retained searches, and  2) We
guarantee our candidates for one year.

Allen Austin Lowe & Powers has done work for Enron in the past and is
located here in Houston.

I can be reached on my direct line listed below or on my cell at (281)
923-4563.

Regards,

Mike Gergen
Allen Austin Lowe & Powers
Partner & Practice Leader
