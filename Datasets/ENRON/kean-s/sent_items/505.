Steve - 

Hello.  Based on a conversation with John Brindle today, he indicated that he had discussed a base salary increase to Kyle Norosky's salary from $96,375 to $101,375.  If you agree with this increase, could you please reply to this e-mail indicating your concurrence.  

Once we receive the e-mail indicating your approval, we will process this increase for Kyle.

If you should have any questions or require additional information, please let me know.

Thank you Steve,
Shelly
