Jim and Ken --

Attached is an article for eBiz (our biweekly online newsletter), which we are scheduled to launch at 7:30 a.m. Friday.  Kelly Kimberly has reviewed it, but has asked that you view the article as well.  Since only EBS employees received your memo about the restructuring -- and the rest of the employees did not receive any communication -- it is extremely important to provide information through this vehicle.  

Please let me know of your approval or if you have any questions.  

Thank you.
Karen
