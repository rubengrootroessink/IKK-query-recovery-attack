Some further questions:
 


Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?
