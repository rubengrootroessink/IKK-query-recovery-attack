I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

This deal depends on the support of your forces - I understand that folks
are upset at ENE mgt particularly Ken's sweetheart deal

What are the chances you guys try to wiggle out of this once we stabilize
you?  I've got to account for that on the Street if it's a real possiblity!
