Ken talked with Barton.  

Barton will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).
