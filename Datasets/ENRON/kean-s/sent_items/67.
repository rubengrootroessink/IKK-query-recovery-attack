Either with you/or your transportation manager.  We are hearing that lots of
companies are rethinking their commercial travel for execs and that companies
are stepping up further in their purchases of Fractional Jet shares as well as
rethinking their entire fleet.  No rush.  Feel free to email or call me
(cellphone = 303-808-8292).  thanks, br
