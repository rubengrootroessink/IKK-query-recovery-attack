Steve,

Info. from my folks (below) about not being able to access ENRON investor
website for conference call.  You might want to have someone check it out.
 

I understand from Ken's office that London has been cancelled.  I'd still
like to come down and talk to you and your folks.   Let me know when would
be a good time.

Harry

Harry, We ended not being successful in accessing the Enron web broadcast,
either live or archived. 

We could reach the page where one then clicked to enter the broadcast but
was not able to enter the broadcast itself, always getting an ERROR
message.

We tried to access both the Enron live and archived broadcasts, using 6
different computers including the web via Bloomberg, using three different
ISPs, and also three different platforms:  Windows, Windows NT and MAC. 
We also tried both RealAudio and Windows Media Player on each computer. 
We took the extra step to download the fresh versions of RealAudio and
Media Player, to make sure antiquated software was not causing our
problem. We tested the software packages on other sites, where each worked
fine.  Four C&W persons tried independently to access Enron's braodcast,
to make sure we weren't simply replicating an error on our part.  After
all this, still nothing.
