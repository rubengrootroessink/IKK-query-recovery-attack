Subject:	Anthrax Precaution  DRAFT EMAIL

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY EDITS TO THIS Email.  I want to send it to the DC staff.

Out of super super precaution, Enron security and others in Houston have recommended that personnel in the DC office be tested for Anthrax exposure.  They do not think there is a problem, but nonetheless recommended that we take this step.  I am awaiting word on where we should go for the test.  Also, please let Carolyn Cooney know if you have had any visitors to the DC office, who have been to Capitol Hill in the last three weeks. 

Again, this is strictly out of precaution, as we strongly believe there is NOT a problem.  In the meantime, while normal business will not be possible with Capitol Hill, let me encourage everyone to continue working on those internal projects we can get done and have been waiting for a quiet moment to do so.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks
