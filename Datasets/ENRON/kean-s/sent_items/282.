We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.  Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato

Hello Mr. Lay,

My name is Larry May, I trade the nat gas pipe options book and report to John Arnold.  I have a suggestion:  due to the volatility in the market Thursday, most of us missed the all employee meeting Thursday.  I think it would be a good morale booster if we had an open meeting on the trade floor.  Thank you.

Respectfully,

Larry May
