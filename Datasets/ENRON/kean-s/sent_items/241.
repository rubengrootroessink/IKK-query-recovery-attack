No change.  The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.  We need to discuss the communication of the changes.  My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.  Is that right?  Is it all employees or only US based?

I am finalizing the severance plan restatement document for the August 13 Comp Committee and Board meeting.  Can you confirm that the changes approved by the Policy Committee are still intended for rollout effective 1/1/2002 with communications to employees during our rollout of 2002 benefit plan changes?
