I just wanted to let you know that we do have a bank meeting scheduled for next Friday, November 9th beginning at 8:00 a.m. CST. I have sent a notice to all of our relationship contacts at our approximately 70 banks that this meeting is for banks only and their respective credit officers. Objective of the meeting is to provide credit-related information - it is not a syndication meeting for the new Chase/Citi $1 billion facility.  My thought is that if you can , you all would attend.

Thanks and I will  keep you all updated as this meeting moves forward,

Kelly
