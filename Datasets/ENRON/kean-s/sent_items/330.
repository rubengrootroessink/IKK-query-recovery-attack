Dear Jim:

I have a good friend here in Seattle named Ralph Palumbo, who is one of the
attorneys with whom we prosecuted the antitrust case against Microsoft that
we settled last year.  His wife Marlys, whom I also know well, is a
candidate for appointment as the administrator of Region 10 of the
Environmental Protection Agency, which encompasses Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and Alaska.  I know that you are busy as hell, but I wanted to set
out below some information about Marlys and about the status of her efforts
to win this appointment, and then ask whether Enron might be interested in
supporting her candidacy by putting in a good word at the White House.

Marlys received her law degree from Seattle University in 1982.  She then
spent four years as a commercial litigation associate at Bogle & Gates in
Seattle.  From 1986-89 she was general counsel of Sabey Corporation (a
diversified real estate development holding company).  From 1989-1997 she
was vice president and general counsel of Philip Environmental Inc.
(formerly Burlington Environmental), which was a publicly traded $500
million waste management and environmental engineering and remediation
company with operations in the U.S. and Canada.  In 1997 that company merged
with two other public companies to form Philip Services Corporation.  From
the date of the merger through the present, Marlys has been Senior VP, Law,
of Philip Services Corp., which is a $2 billion company that provides
integrated industrial and metals recovery services to commercial and
industrial customers in North America and Europe.  For the last several
years, Marlys has worked out of the Philip Services corporate offices in
Houston.

Marlys has in-depth expertise on environmental legal and scientific issues,
coupled with senior management experience in the business world.  She would
bring to the table a unique ability to effect a change of direction in EPA
Region 10 because she has worked effectively with this Region and other
Regions for two decades.  Implementing White House policies in Region 10
will require the Administrator to work with a staff of long-term
professional civil servants who themselves have extensive legal and
scientific expertise.  The Administrator must win their respect and must
have the personal skills to manage a large organization and lead it in new
directions.  Marlys has the experience, the skills, and the personal
qualities that would well-suit her to doing all of those things.

Her candidacy is being supported by former EPA Administrator Bill
Ruckelshaus, by other former senior EPA and Justice Department officials,
and by business and industry leaders in the Northwest, including CEOs or
other senior executives of Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, PACCAR, Puget Sound Energy,
Simpson Investments/Simpson Timber Co., Plum Creek Timber Group, Delta
Airlines, Burlington Northern, Air Cargo Management Group; FMC Corp., Fluke
Capital Management, and Sabey Corp.

My understanding is that the appointment will be made based on
recommendations from Republican Representatives and Senators from the four
states encompassed by Region 10, and key people in both the EPA and the
White House.  Washington has no Republican Senators, but Republican
Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn has recommended Marlys to the White House.

I have known Marlys since shortly after moving to Seattle in 1995.  She is
an extremely bright, charming, and capable person, and I have a lot of
respect for her.  If you think Enron would be willing to consider helping
her candidacy, I know that she would be eager to meet or talk with you or
others at Enron, and I can provide the names of the relevant contact people
at EPA and the White House.

I am not asking that you do anything as a favor to me, but only if it would
serve Enron's interests to do so.  Of course, this issue may be completely
outside the realm of those interests, and if so, I apologize for taking up
your time.  I hope all is well with you and Carrin, and look forward to
seeing both of you again soon.

Parker
