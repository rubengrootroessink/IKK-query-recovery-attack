I have a question related to your former responsibilities:  As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).  With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.  What do you think?
