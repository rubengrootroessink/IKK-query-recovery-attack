Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind. (Enron Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.
