Texas' Role in the National Energy Policy
presented by Texas Conservative Forum
 
Thursday, September 27, 2001
2 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
River Place Country Club
4207 River Place Blvd
Austin, TX 78730
Hors d'oeuvres reception following.
 
On September 27, Texas Conservative Forum, a non-profit organization run by Congressman Joe Barton and State Representative Ray Allen, will host a conference targeting the role Texas will play in the new national energy strategy as outlined in the President's National Energy Policy Development Group report, as well as emerging deregulation issues nationwide and in Texas. 
 
In recent months, California's power shortages and rising fuel and energy costs nationwide have kept Americans guessing about the future of our country's energy policy.  As the Bush Administration works to formulate a new energy strategy for America, what impact should Texans expect?  What are some positive contributions Texas can make, and what specific challenges, if any, face Texans in the developing national policy?  This conference intends to address these and related questions.
 
The conference will showcase a wide variety of panelists, including state and federal lawmakers, agency representatives, and industry and research experts.  The conference should be of interest to Texas energy producers, researchers, and members of the business community, as well as industry leaders from around the nation.  
 
As of September 14, confirmed speakers include Kurt Yeager, President and CEO of Electric Power Research Institute; John Anderson, Executive Director of Electricity Consumers Resource Council; Randy Eminger, South Region Vice President of the Center for Energy and Economic Development; Todd Onderdonk, Senior Energy Advisor for ExxonMobil; Diana Knox, Central Region Senior Vice President of Calpine Corporation; Rick Walker, Director, Renewable Energy Business Development, American Electric Power; Dave Garman, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency, U.S. Department of Energy; Jimmy Glotfelty, Senior Energy Advisor, U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. Congressman Joe Barton, U.S. Congressman Ralph Hall; Texas Railroad Commissioner Charles Matthews; and Texas Senator J.E. "Buster" Brown.
