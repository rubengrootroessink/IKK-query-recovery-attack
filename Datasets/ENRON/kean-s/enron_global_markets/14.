Former USDA Secretary Glickman has joined David Carlin at Akin Gump, which is 
great news for Enron in the event that we move forward with our entry into 
the ag business.   On February 13th, the Enron Board will decide whether to 
launch the "soft" commodities (coffee, sugar, cocoa) on EOL.   Gary Hickerson 
doesn't anticipate that there will be a problem.  Decisions on meats and 
grains will be made later this spring.   

I'll keep you posted.

Lisa

Lisa and Chris,

FYI - we're excited to have him here and I think he can be helpful to your 
business as we move forward.

Dave
