Today, the House Ways and Means passed it version of the economic package.  The package included a repeal of the corporate AMT retroactive until 2000 and refundable AMT credits.  The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.  Please see the memo below for more info.  
 
Also, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a 2-year extension of the Wind Production Tax Credit.
 
Have a nice weekend.
