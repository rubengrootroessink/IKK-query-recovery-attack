Amit - The House just passed its version of the stimulus package which included a two-year extension of the PTC.  The Senate will likely act next week.  Senate Finance Chair Baucus floated a plan yesterday which included a one-year extension.  

The bill will go to conference committee and will undergo significant changes. Both Chairman Thomas and Finance Ranking Member Grassley are strong supporters of a longer extension, so two years is very possible.

We are continuing our efforts in support of a multi-year extension (we don't like to limit it to two years). 

Again, I wish I could tell you with more certainty the final outcome.  The PTC is a piece in a much larger debate.  Please feel free to contact me for constant updates.

Chris,

Are we still looking at 2 years?  Is the timing of passage still October-end?

Amit - The House Ways and Means Committee has rushed to mark-up its stimulus package this morning at 9:00 am.  I am on my up there righ now.  The extenders, including the PTC will be extended for two years under the version on the bill to be considered today.  I will update as we get changes.

Thanks - Chris

Hi Chris:

I am hearing from the wind company that it is more likely that PTC will be part of the extenders package in November rather than the stimulus package in October.  Your comments would be appreciated.

Also, what are you hearing in terms of the length of extension?  3 or 5 years?  

thanks

Amit

Amit - Recent events have had a dramatic impact on the Congressional agenda.  Congress is in discussion with the Administration on the need for an economic stimulus package.  Congressional leaders are saying that they will wait a week or so before deciding on how to proceed.  The package would likely be in the $50-$100 billion range and include tax law changes, incentives to invesment, trade promotion measures, and job training.  

PTC extension and the other expiring tax provisions could very likely be attached to the stimulus package.  If it is not or a stimulus package does not materialize, we have been assured Congress would consider a stand alone extenders package.  All that said, we are fairley certain that the PTC should be extended before Congress adjourns.  The target date for Congressional adjournment in October 16, however this is could change.

This can and will change given the national security situation, so please feel free to get back with me anytime.

Chris,

In light of recent events and Congress' pre-occupation with other issues, what is the likely impact on the timing (and likelihood?) of PTC extension.

Thanks

Amit

Amit - Congress is on recess until September and will not adjourn in October as planned.  We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December. 

The PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package (it was part of the tax title).  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October.  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well.

Now to the timing, it is unclear if the energy package (with the PTC extension)will move before Congress adjourns for the year.  If it does not, then Congress can pass what it calls an "extenders package" which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.  If that were to not happen, then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December 31, 2001.  Any of theses scenarios is possible.

While nothing is 100% when you deal with Congress, I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next.  The question then becomes for how long.  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate.  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers.

Let me know if you need additional information.

Chris,

We wanted to get an update on what was happending with the PTC in Washington.  Are we still on track to get an extension before Congress adjourns in early October?  What if any impact will the debate surrounding the reduction in the budget surplus have on the PTC?

thanks

Amit Walia

				Linda and I are following the PTC for Corp. out of DC.  Ed Coats in Enron Corporate Tax leads from Houston.  We have a Bracewell Patterson attorney in DC retained to support our corporate tax efforts on Capitol Hill.  

				Enron Wind also has a lobbyist dedicated 24/7 to this effort.

				Chris,

				Thanks very much for the prompt reply.  This is exactly what I needed.  Who is working this in-house?  Do we have any outside resources devoted to it?

				Mark

					Mark - I left a voice mail on your cell.

					The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2001.   The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.

					The question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:

					1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.

					2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an "extenders" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.  In this scenario, the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest.

					Mark, this is Congress, so anything can change.  

					Call me with any questions at (202) 466-9158.
