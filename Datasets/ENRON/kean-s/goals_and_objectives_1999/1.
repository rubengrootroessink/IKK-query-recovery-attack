We recently concluded an exercise to identify the top =01&ten=018 objective=
s for=20
U.S./Canada Government Affairs for 2000, which I presented to the group at=
=20
the December 16 staff meeting.  Our success in achieving these objectives=
=20
will define the group=01,s success in the New Year.

Two of our top three objectives involve providing support to the Risk=20
Management group in EES.  Number 3 and Number 2 (one of the number 2=01,s) =
are,=20
respectively,

? Ensure that PG&E=01,s generation-related stranded cost is =01&rolled off=
=018 no=20
later than September 30, 2000 and generally protect and inform EES curves
? Understand rules/tariffs/outcomes better than anyone else and convert to=
=20
information valuable to business units

As a general matter, it is imperative that we continue to assure ourselves=
=20
that our everyday efforts are focused on achieving the objectives that are =
so=20
critical to our success.  The way the group provides support to EES Risk=20
Management, and in turn achieves the objectives noted above, is one area=20
where there is potential to improve performance with a refocusing of effort=
s.

Toward this end, I am asking that these individuals take on the=20
responsibility, for their respective regional group, of being a point of=20
contact for EES Risk Management:

Mona Petrochko, Western Region  Kate Wagner, South Central/Southeast Region
Becky Merola, Great Lakes/Midwest Region Frank Rishe, Mid Atlantic/New=20
York/New England Region

Mona, Becky, Kate and Frank will work with individuals on the EES pricing=
=20
desk to improve the flow of information necessary for timely, accurate=20
utility rate curves and help EES develop strategies to improve the economic=
s=20
of existing outsource deals.  I expect this activity will take a significan=
t=20
portion of their time.  They will coordinate their efforts with Harry=20
Kingerski and Pat Keene who will continue to provide a centralized support =
to=20
EES Risk Management from Houston.

I recognize that many of you are called on from time to time to provide oth=
er=20
types of support to EES, for sales calls, licensing requirements,=20
environmental issues, legal support, and the like.  This change in no way=
=20
affects these other activities and you should continue to pursue those=20
efforts. =20

As a final note, I invite all of you to identify and bring to me ways we ca=
n=20
improve our chances of success in meeting any of our Year 2000 objectives. =
 I=20
am not interested in change just for its own sake but will certainly consid=
er=20
doing things differently if our likelihood of success can be improved.=20

Best to you for the New Year!
