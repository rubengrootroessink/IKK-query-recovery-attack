Given the negativity toward Enron at the CPUC, should we not file comments =
if these express our position?

Dan Douglass has drafted joint comments for two coalitions in which Enron i=

Forum.  Robert, feel free to contact Dan directly with your comments.  Let =
me know your thoughts as well.  I am out of the office at a WPTF meeting. D=
an is here as well. If you need to contact me, you can leave me a message o=
n my office phone or try my cell (415 -- 902-4108), but I'm not sure the ce=

Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be  f=
iled on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and  Commi=
ssioner Bilas.  Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in  everything=
 I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some significant  editi=
ng.  Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with Bilas' request  for=
 parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.  The draft offers a  com=
promise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the Angelides memo.   Also, =
notice that Section VI urges the Commission to bifurcate the DA and PX  cre=
dit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it must, but more leisurely on =
 the PX credit subject.

Finally, I have a suggestion in the form of a question.  How  would AReM me=
mbers feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?  There  is cross-mem=
bership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised  in the =
separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.  This draft  would=
 requires some modifications so as to refer to the "Joint Parties" as  oppo=
sed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might  add a section dealing more  exp=
licitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill stipulati=
on  signed in the first place.  Otherwise, the document would stay much as =
it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).  Please l=
et  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF draft.  =
 Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which will =
 support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not proposi=
ng  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.  Thanks for your help!   Comm=
ents as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!
