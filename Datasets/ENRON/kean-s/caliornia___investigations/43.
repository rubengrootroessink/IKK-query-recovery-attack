here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
pollster for President Bush:

Gray Davis

FAV             48
UNFAV	       44

STRONG UNFAV     28
STRONG FAV          15


RIGHT TRACK         34
WRONG TRACK      49


DAVIS  		40
RIORDAN          39




Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
situation politically.
