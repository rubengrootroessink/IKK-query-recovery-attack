Employees: Power supply held down By Kevin Yamamura and Emily Bazar Bee Cap=
itol Bureau (Published June 22, 2001)  Three former San Diego Gas & Electri=
c Co. employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the ge=
nerator destroyed working parts, withheld power supply or otherwise took ac=
tions that they believe drove up the price of electricity.  State officials=
 said the whistle-blowers' comments at a state Senate hearing today could p=
rovide the most damaging illustration yet that power generators held down p=
roduction to inflate prices on the spot market. Gov. Gray Davis has long al=
leged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities.  Jimmy=
 Olkjer, a former assistant control room operator at Duke's South Bay plant=
 in San Diego, said in a phone interview that during the state's power shor=
tages, Duke cut supply. Although Duke, a Charlotte, N.C.-based company, own=
ed the plant, and it contracted with SDG&E to operate the unit, he said.  "=
Rather than creating more power, they were creating less," Olkjer said. "I =
think there was manipulation of the market."  The California Public Utiliti=
es Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investig=
ate price manipulation allegations, and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has s=
aid he will take witnesses to a grand jury next month.  The generators have=
 denied they manipulated the market.  "We stand behind our maintenance prac=
tices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing," Duke spokesman T=
om Williams told the CBS television network.  But former mechanic Glenn Joh=
nson said he saw generation units taken "down for economics."  Ed Edwards, =
also a mechanic, said he was ordered to destroy 23 pallets of working parts=
.  "We were asked, myself and other employees, to disperse of perfectly goo=
d parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components," Edwards =
said.  State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the market-manipulatio=
n committee, said his staff has been looking for employees or others with i=
ntimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward, and he promised=
 that others will testify at future hearings.  "It's the first time that we=
've had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the r=
amping up and ramping down of power generation was a response to price and =
not to demand," Dunn said.  He said he would reach no conclusions until Duk=
e and other generators testify next month, but he added that the former emp=
loyees' testimony raises suspicions "at first blush."   The Bee's Kevin Yam=

        Consumers cut their own power in protest  By Silvina Mart?nez Bee S=
taff Writer  (Published June 22, 2001)  When the temperature hit 100 degree=

responded to the "Roll Your Own Blackout" Thursday and joined thousands thr=
oughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by st=
opping the use of energy from 7-10 p.m.  But the data coming off the grid a=
t the California Independent System Operator didn't show the effort.  Durin=
g the first hour of the voluntary shut-off, the demand for energy by PG&E c=
ustomers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same time Wed=
nesday, ISO officials said.  Protesters didn't expect significant changes o=
n the grid.  "I feel it will at least send a message that we don't have to =
depend on it (energy)," said Jackie Bell, 37, a consultant at the Capitol j=
oining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue.  "It's j=
ust a symbolic act," said Peter Lopez of Sacramento, who decided to use the=
 evening to meditate. "Maybe I'll just go outside, stare at the stars and t=
ry to spot a few constellations in the night."  It was the longest day of t=

ion didn't mind the sacrifice.  "People are getting focused on the fact tha=
t we have power at our end," said Joan Blades, a spokeswoman for MoveOn, a =
grass-roots organization in the Bay Area and one of hundreds of online grou=
ps passing along the call for the voluntary blackout.  An electrical engine=
er in Oakland started the "Roll Your Own Blackout" idea when he posted a no=
te in a political chat room in April. Then an artist in Los Angeles forward=
ed the e-mail to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the =
globe.  By Thursday afternoon, more than 12,000 people had signed up at the=
 MoveOn Web site to join the protest, Blades said.  Many threw blackout par=
ties. In San Francisco, the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundre=
ds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach.  At his home in east Sacramento, Ly=
nch did fine without electricity for three hours. He ate tuna salad for din=
ner, watered the lawn and when it got dark, he opened the windows and let s=
ome air in.  "We should show that people are willing to shut the power off =
if the prices go too high," he said.  ISO has not declared a power emergenc=
y since May 31.  "We have seen a consistent conservation on a day-to-day ba=

Davis consultants had contract with Edison: The disclosures turn up the hea=
t on the governor for hiring the ex-Clinton aides. By Emily Bazar Bee Capit=
ol Bureau (Published June 22, 2001)  Two consultants hired to advise Gov. G=
ray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Souther=
n California Edison on Thursday, but Davis aides insisted it is not a confl=
ict because "Edison and the Governor's Office have the same goal."  Communi=
cations consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense critic=
ism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor's pub=
lic response to the state energy crisis.  The former Clinton administration=
 communication aides -- nicknamed the "Masters of Disaster" for their spin =
on the Whitewater, travel office and 1996 fund-raising controversies at the=
 Clinton White House -- have come under fire for receiving a six-month, $30=
,000-a-month contract, more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes.=
  Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who is running for governor n=
ext year, has called for an investigation into potential conflicts. State C=
ontroller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, has said she will not issue paychec=
ks to the pair pending her own investigation.  The criticism mounted after =
the duo's economic interest disclosure forms were released late Thursday, s=
howing that each has received at least $10,000 under contract from Edison i=
n the past year.  But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credib=
ility, saying there's no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani bo=
th disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contr=
acts with the state.  Besides, she added, Edison and the governor are worki=
ng toward the same goal: Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of=
 understanding, a proposed agreement, that would prevent Edison from going =
bankrupt by financing a state purchase of the utility's transmission lines.=
  "It's not a conflict because there's been full disclosure," McLean said. =
"Edison and the Governor's Office have the same goal, passing the MOU. We'r=
e working together at this point with Edison."  But open-government groups =
and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any=
 potential conflict.  Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Rese=
arch Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public official=
s from influencing decisions if it would have "a material financial effect"=
 on a business entity that provided them $500 or more within the last year.=
  "You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously be=
en on the Edison payroll and it's not clear to whom their loyalties are," h=
e said. "Just because they've revealed it doesn't mean there's not a confli=
ct there, and that they're not serving two masters."  On Thursday, Jones sa=
id he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission in=
vestigation and agrees with Connell's decision this week to withhold paymen=
t from the consultants.  "This further calls into question the ethics of ho=
w these individuals were hired and contracts were let," Jones said.  Senate=
 Republican leader Jim Brulte believes there's no question that Lehane and =
Fabiani are violating conflict-of-interest laws and suggested that the two =
should be paid out of Davis' campaign funds, which had reached $26 million =
by Jan. 1.  Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, added that he would not vote for a=
 state budget as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll.  "=
The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths $30=

State deal may ease blackout threat =09

Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel  UNION-TRIBUNE =
STAFF WRITER  June 22, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California may be able to avoid =
some of the blackouts predicted for this summer, thanks to a little-known p=
ower-swapping agreement with a Canadian utility.  The arrangement is expect=
ed to give California electricity in July and August from the hydroelectric=
 generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia, despite a serious drought in t=
he Northwest.  California has sold surplus power in recent months to the go=
vernment-owned utility, which is expected to return power to the state as h=
eat drives up the demand for electricity.          State deal may ease blac=
kout threat   Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis         Despit=
e the energy crunch, the state often finds itself with surplus power that c=
an be sold or swapped. For instance, advance power purchases that provide e=
nergy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given tim=
e, particularly during off-peak hours.  BC Hydro's reservoirs and hydroelec=
tric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery. By import=
ing California power, BC Hydro has been able to conserve water that can be =
released this summer to produce power for California.  As a result of the a=
greement and other factors, state power buyers say they are in a stronger p=
osition going into the hot summer months than they had expected. So far thi=
s week, the state has managed to get through a heat wave without so much as=
 a Stage 1 power alert.  "We are in much better shape at this point than I =
imagined we would have been as little as a month ago," said Ray Hart, head =
of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources.  T=
he North American Electric Reliability Council, which last month predicted =
260 hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer, has noticed a ch=
ange in recent weeks.  "We don't seem to have the crisis we were all expect=
ing," said Ellen Vancko, a council spokeswoman. "But whether that is a shor=
t-term or a long-term event we don't think anyone knows yet."  Much of the =
credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by=
 Californians and an increased supply of power. Many generators that had be=
en shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now back on line.  But =
the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now.  Hart menti=
oned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week. But he declined=
 to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro, saying it could hurt t=
he state's competitive position in the market.  "If I start talking specifi=
cs," said Hart, "then I have to give out what I am doing every single day, =
and I have no market position."  In the past, California routinely sent pow=
er to a number of utilities in the Pacific Northwest during the winter when=
 residents there needed heat. Northwest utilities returned power to Califor=
nia in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand.  Little was expect=
ed from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short o=
f power last winter as electricity prices soared, and drought has sharply l=
owered reservoirs in the Northwest. But the agreement with BC Hydro will pr=
ovide at least some power this summer.  The state was forced to begin buyin=
g power in January after its two largest utilities, Southern California Edi=
son and Pacific Gas and Electric, were unable to borrow because of a $13 bi=
llion debt. The rates that the utilities could charge their customers were =
frozen under a failed deregulation plan as the cost of power on the wholesa=
le market skyrocketed.  Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro, which =
has demanded cash for some electricity, that it could safely do business wi=
th California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied =
to the utilities.  "We have only been able to do it for the last couple of =
months," said Hart. "It took a long time to get them to do it because of cr=
edit issues."  A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power s=
waps but does not release the name of the other parties or the terms of the=
 agreements.  "Our first priority is taking care of our own," said Warren C=
ousins of BC Hydro. "We are still looking for opportunities to help out oth=
er entities when we can."  Hart said the state has another arrangement with=
 the federal Bonneville Power Authority, but again refused to provide detai=
ls. He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers, including t=
he Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  Information about state powe=
r purchases had been closely guarded until recently. Gov. Gray Davis, press=
ured by lawsuits and a court ruling, released edited versions last week of =
38 long-term power contracts worth $43 billion.  The Davis administration s=
aid it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dro=
pped, easing competitive pressures.    =09





Ex-worker: Duke manipulated market =09
=09




By Bill Ainsworth  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  June 22, 2001  SACRAMENTO --=
 A former operator at Duke Energy's Chula Vista plant said he was told freq=
uently by company officials during the past year to alter the plant's outpu=
t in a way that may have boosted electricity prices.  The operator, Jimmy O=
lkjer, said he was even ordered to cut power generation during energy emerg=
encies, when the state faced rolling blackouts because of a scarce supply o=
f electricity.  He said he believes reducing the electricity generation hel=
ped the company charge higher prices. "It looks like that's what they were =
doing," Olkjer said in an interview.  He and another former plant employee =
said that during the past year the company regularly operated its least-eff=
icient turbine, possibly to justify higher prices.  The allegations, which =
they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power gen=
erators, provide the first insider evidence that Duke Energy may have manip=
ulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up prices.  Duke, based in No=
rth Carolina, leases the South Bay plant from the San Diego Unified Port Di=
strict.  A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages C=
alifornia's electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and fo=
ur other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollar=
s in overcharges to California consumers.  Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke=
 Energy North America, said that varying the output of the generating units=
 at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher p=
rices.  He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "d=
ancing in the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowin=
g the plant to add or reduce power quickly.  Williams added that the aging =
South Bay plant produced as many megawatts last year as it did in 1994.  Ol=
kjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was own=
ed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, workers =
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,=
 Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.  During the two=
 years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators frequently got ca=
lls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City=
 telling them to adjust their production schedule.  Some employees at the p=
lant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted by the Independent Sy=
stem Operator and recognized a correlation, he said.  "We noticed that a lo=
t of times when the price was down (our) megawatts would go down," he said.=
 "If the price was up, often the megawatts would go up."  Olkjer said he wa=
s never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's output up and dow=
n. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it was none of his bu=
siness.  Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle d=
own the plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan.=
 16 when the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rollin=
g blackouts.  "It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a St=
age 3 alert," he said.  Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn d=
own units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid =
manager can find cheaper power somewhere else.  Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at t=
he ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to pow=
er down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.  Olkjer said the frequent adjustment=
s of power production, which sometimes occurred every half-hour, wear out t=
he plant's equipment.  "It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like =
driving down the street putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on=
 the brake."  Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vis=
ta, which have the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated ste=
adily during much of their history.  S. David Freeman, formerly general man=
ager of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adv=
iser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid cycling had become more common under de=
regulation and is hard on equipment.  "We had almost 15,000 megawatts of ge=
nerating capacity down for repair last winter," said Freeman, referring to =
what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages ov=
er several months.  SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, =
sold it to the Port District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the =
plant to Duke Energy for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a swee=
theart deal.  The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In=
 the first quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in Cal=
ifornia, said profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales an=
d trading.  Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for ele=
ctricity. It asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, befor=
e the energy crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hou=
r, an amount which powers about 750 homes.  Federal regulators have ordered=
 the company to refund $20 million to the state for charging excessive pric=
es unless the company can justify them.  In May, the company offered to pay=
 the state to settle any price gouging investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis =
declined.  Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years =
before being laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran =
the inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other ge=
nerators sat idle.  They said they believed it may have been an attempt to =
fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees whe=
n it ran.  Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He sai=
d Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive.=
 It ran on jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the ot=
her units.  Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destr=
oyed.  "It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he =
said.  Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista w=
ere prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts.  The =
former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward becau=
se they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community.  "It=
 kind of irritated me because you know there's people on a fixed income tha=
t can't afford a big utility bill," said Olkjer.  Staff writer Craig D. Ros=

iters        Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked fo=
r billions of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study tha=
t state officials concede may have significant flaws, according to intervie=
ws and confidential government documents.      Those costs--estimated by th=
e state to be as high as $9 billion--were central to Davis' testimony this =
week before a U.S. Senate committee, where he again denounced power wholesa=
lers and urged federal regulators to "give us back the money that was wrong=
ly taken from us."      The governor's impassioned demand, however, was bas=
ed on shaky calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Rob=
inson, vice president of California's grid operator, which prepared the stu=
dy.      Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overc=
harged by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands =
by the numbers.      But internal documents from the California Independent=
 System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quanti=
fy the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark.      What's more,=
 the documents caution against relying on the agency's study as a basis for=
 allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimony Wednesday. =
That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for t=
he first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospe=
red from the state's power troubles between last summer and February.      =
The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies, acco=
rding to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos. led =
the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million, Sou=
thern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Reliant E=
nergy Services with $750 million.      When told of the alleged profiteerin=
g attributed to them, executives of the companies insisted the numbers were=
 grossly overstated because of Cal-ISO's poor methodology.      Duke spokes=
man Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings for North Americ=
a were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in Californi=
a.      "It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams s=
aid. "What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."      Paula Hal=
l-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would need to study t=
he ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports fail to fully =
account for electricity production costs.      "We maintain that we have no=
t overcharged, and that we have operated legally."      Reliant spokesman R=
ichard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying, "There's a lot of misi=
nformation out of there."      A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overch=
arged. We haven't manipulated. We haven't withheld."       Even some firms =
alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were outraged.      Joe=
 Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine, =
said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any relation =
to reality."      "Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like M=
cCarthyism. . . . Where is the evidence?"      A spokeswoman for Davis conc=
eded that his refund figure was an estimate but defended it as reasonable. =
     "It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute =
an estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden =
said.      Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officia=
ls Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to t=
he agency's figures as potential overcharges.       "The way it should be c=
haracterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark," said Robins=
on, who is also Cal-ISO's general counsel.      The first version of the no=
w-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in March. It estimated that power =
sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profits between May 2000 and last Feb=
ruary. The report, later revised upward to $6.7 billion, became a crucial e=
lement of the Davis Administration's campaign against alleged electricity p=
rice gougers.      This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, th=
e study was updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess p=
rofits through May.      The orginal study, which did not include actual pr=
icing data, was mostly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking inf=
ormation from generators that the state had been denied, Robinson said.    =
  Thus far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of=
 only $125 million. Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement confe=
rence aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state, as well as t=
hose of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by =
California utilities.      One encouraging signal for state officials came =
this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millio=
ns in refunds. The order stemmed from the company's sale of electricity at =
$3,880 a megawatt hour--for thousands of hours.      FERC's order said Duke=
's pricing had resulted in $11 million in billings. A fair price for that p=
ower would have been $273 per megawatt hour, the agency said.      Tom Will=

 He said he company has yet to collect a dime.  ---       Times staff write=

t. The utility, Southern California Edison, has lost billions of dollars on=
 electricity sales over the last year.      The high interest rate on Ediso=
n's proposed sale of seven-year notes is about double what a credit-worthy =
company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium =
amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the co=
mpany's already strapped financial condition, analysts said. It's a full tw=
o percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk, or specula=

raised the rate to 13% in recent days because it was finding few takers on =
Wall Street.      "The word is that they couldn't get people interested and=
 that they might not be able to get it done," said Kurt Stabel, a money man=
ager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach.      The higher rate, how=
ever, might be pulling investors out of the woodwork and has increased the =
chance that Edison will pull off the deal, Scotto said.      "This never pr=
omised to be a day at the beach," Scotto said. "I think it is really a ques=
tion of find the right price, the price at which people feel comfortable wi=

is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or "selling" than=
 typical corporate offerings.      Mission Energy Holding Co., a company cr=
eated by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds, will offer the=
 notes. The assets of Edison Mission Energy, a subsidiary that owns a netwo=

 a credit rating of BB-minus and come due in 2008, according to bond rating=
 agency Standard & Poor's. That's slightly higher than the near-default CC =
rating now carried by Edison.      If the offering failed, Edison would fac=

Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant  Power: Homeowners an=
d environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is proposed as a 1,200-ac=
re state park.   By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer        In a victory for=
 environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy company announced Thurs=
day that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a=
 proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.       La Jolla Energy Developmen=
t Inc., in a letter to the state Energy Commission, said it was withdrawing=
 its application for fast-track approval of the 53-megawatt plant and "will=
 not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future."      "We listened to the c=
ommunity," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday. =
"We need to find another place for this equipment."      The project was to=
 be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources, an oil company =
that leases the land where the trailer-sized natural-gas plant would sit.  =
    Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether th=
ey will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out,"=
 Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.      But most observers said it would =
be difficult to move forward on the fast-track schedule the state has imple=
mented to relieve the energy crisis.      The state commission was schedule=
d to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento, but the hea=
ring has been canceled.      The news sparked elation among environmentalis=
ts and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it wou=
ld pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1=
,200 acres of public open space in the hills.      "We're getting ready to =
have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas, president of the hills' United=
 Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community can come together for a commo=
n goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days."      About 76% of the =
residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a mat=
ter of environmental justice.       In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were =
seeking approval for the plant within 21 days of filing their application, =
under the governor's emergency power orders. By following this fast-tracked=
 procedure, they would have been able to avoid the normal, time-consuming e=
nvironmental review process.      That angered opponents even further, and =
nearly 1,000 people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the proje=
ct.      But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a =
time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possibl=
e--was testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who sai=
d his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.      Executive=
 Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings =
that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well beyond a Sept. 30 =
deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He also said it was u=
nlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws.   =
   In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It a=
ppears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until som=
e time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the =
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen=
t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a p=
lant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.      Conservationists embraced the out=
come as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam. The Ba=
ldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating gre=
en space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With=
 support from the governor and local politicians, the state recently bought=
 a 68-acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented $41 million.      "This =
is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so =
hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther Feldman, pre=
sident of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to bui=
ld the park.      Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin=
 Murray (D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who ha=
d come out strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether=
 the small amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after th=
e dog days of summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.      "I'm=
 ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."      The p=
lant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet from the =
Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park proponents, it wo=
uld lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on what would be a =
half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.      Rusch, the=
 spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information circulating about the =
trailer-sized plant is false.      The plan did not call for "a stack with =
billowing smoke," he said. "If the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air =
quality up." In the last decade, Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil=
 pumps on the property have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons =
to 3 tons a year. The power plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimatel=
y add about 18 tons a year.      He said the company was trying to cut its =
energy bills by providing its own power to pump oil, while also contributin=
g an extra 39 megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis.      Re=
sidents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the ene=
rgy problem. Said Mary Ann Green, president of the Blair Hills Homeowners A=
ssn.: "We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the=
 community."=09

(06-22) 02:45 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --=20
When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer, who will deci=
de whether Silicon Valley computers, Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas=
 casinos get first dibs on what's left?=20
It's a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi=
s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West, using a formula based=
 on California's power costs.=20
Economists, energy industry executives and officials in all 11 states are b=
eginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle.=20
Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging, ot=
hers worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Calif=
ornia's neighbors, or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fe=
nd off shortages. That could diminish any leverage power buyers might have =
as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day.=20
Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem =
come winter, when power demand drops in the Golden State, said Gary Ackerma=
n, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents most selle=
rs of energy.=20
States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter=
 would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap, which is usually=
 determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last-minute power dur=
ing the most recent energy supply emergency in California.=20
That may leave power wholesalers, and not a free market, to decide who gets=
 the energy.=20
"Certainly, California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for prob=
ably the last year," said Claudia Rapkoch, spokeswoman for Montana Power Co=
., which supplies natural gas and electricity to two-thirds of the Big Sky =
state. "What it means for this winter, we're just going to have to wait and=
 see."=20
California utilities had much more control over power supplies before dereg=
ulation in 1996 obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage =
competition. This brought lower prices for a time, but gave control over po=
wer supplies to wholesalers that aren't obligated by state law to serve the=
 serve the best interests of local customers.=20
Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power=
 in the West, Ackerman predicts utilities in non-deregulated states will si=
mply sell their power within their borders. That would hurt California, whi=
ch this week imported about 10 percent of its electricity and its remaining=
 supply from local plants owned by out-of-state power companies.=20
Price cap or not, utilities in the region will watch out for each other as =
best they can, because they might need the favor returned, said Charles Rei=
nhold, executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz.=20
Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the state's budget, Ca=
lifornia recently began to sign long-term contracts with generators. Gov. G=
ray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on th=
e spot market, which earlier this month fell below $50 per megawatt hour fo=
r the first time in a year.=20
The long-term contracts, though, weren't cheap. California will pay an aver=
age of $70 per megawatt hour during the next decade under 38 different cont=
racts signed so far.=20

Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc. to avoid refu=
nding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity=
 prices in January and February.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March=
 9, and Duke responded by filing a challenge. But the commission on Monday =
rejected the company's appeal and reiterated its earlier order, claiming Du=
ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power =
for $3, 880 per megawatt hour.=20
"We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or b=
ehavior," the commission said.=20
Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged $3,880 per megawatt for ab=
out 5,500 megawatt hours sold to the state's major utilities in January and=
 February, netting it more than $19 million in receivables.=20
The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund, but it di=
rected the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a pr=
ice of $273. From a FERC document, it appears that about 2,835 hours occurr=
ed in January, which would result in a total refund for that month of $10.2=
 million.=20
Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ=
ia Independent System Operator, the manager of the state's electricity grid=
, and the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californian=
s for electricity.=20
Meanwhile, employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke =
are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the =
company ramped production up and down. That allegedly was aimed at lowering=
 power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity p=
rices on the spot market.=20
The workers were employed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. but were working =
under contract to Duke.=20

Washington -- There was a reason Gov. Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket =
and endured beastly humid 90-degree heat this week in an area behind the Ca=
pitol known as the "House swamp."=20
The nation was watching. And after months of political free fall, his messa=
ge seemed to be taking hold.=20
"California has been bilked out of $9 billion while the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission was asleep at the switch," Davis declared, repeating test=
imony he had delivered hours earlier in the air-conditioned confines of a S=
enate hearing room.=20
Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as 10 television cameras and two dozen=
 reporters recorded the scene, the California governor apparently couldn't =
resist taking another shot: "For nearly a year I've been pounding on this c=
ommission to enforce the law."=20
The state's energy crisis, with its volatile spot markets, out-of-state gen=
erators and dearth of alternative energy providers, is a dizzyingly complex=
 policy puzzle. The politics are much simpler.=20
Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders, defending helpless util=
ity customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators. Re=
publicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long-term s=
olutions, rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy-handed overreactions wi=
th Soviet-style results.=20
The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle. Though the debate i=
s far from settled, the consumer-oriented approach to California's energy w=
oes has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in =
2002 and the White House in 2004.=20
"Republicans are scared out of their minds about this," said one gleeful De=
mocrat on Capitol Hill, who suggested that the White House's lackadaisical =
response to California's problems would rile consumers from coast to coast.=
=20
"This could rival Pete Wilson's alienation of Latinos," said the Democrat, =
referring to the former Republican governor's strident stand against illega=
l immigrants, which many blame for the party's weak standing in California.=
=20
A sign of the GOP's concern surfaced this week with television ads, finance=
d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists, that b=
lame the Democratic governor for California's energy problems.=20
Democrats, who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second =
term, now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regu=
lators to take a more active role.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had previously resisted suc=
h efforts, took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monda=
y. Later in the week, two commissioners appointed by President Bush testifi=
ed that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge r=
efunds to California. And just yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney, who h=
as been among California's most vocal critics, told Senate Democrats behind=
 closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regula=
tors agreed, according to those in the meeting.=20
"There is no doubt in my mind that action (taken by federal regulators) was=
 the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the Califo=
rnia delegation," Davis said.=20
The pressure did not come only from Democrats. Republican lawmakers, some o=
f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in 2002, wrote FERC last week,=
 requesting commissioners to "take further actions" to help the state.=20
The Democrats' public relations success follows an effort by the party to r=
aise the profile of its consumer crusade. Hardly a day has passed in the pa=
st several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference to =
attack the White House, the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio=
n.=20
But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor=
e focused on long-term energy production than the immediate concerns of Cal=
ifornians. Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to so=
lve the power mess, the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the pli=
ght of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackou=
ts.=20
Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month. =
But the damage appears to have extended beyond California.=20
A CBS News/New York Times poll released this week of 1,050 adults from acro=
ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bus=
h was doing on energy. More than half the respondents said that protecting =
the environment was a higher priority than producing energy, yet barely one=
 in 10 said that Bush shared that priority.=20
Some Republicans say that Bush was in a no-win position, contending that an=
ything he did would have been attacked by California's opportunistic govern=
or.=20
"Politics is (Davis') main objective, and I don't see the Bush administrati=
on being that way," said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Fresno.=20
The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too suc=
cessful. By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role, D=
emocrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapego=
at.=20
"Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat. No=
w that FERC has given him what he wants, or close enough to it, it's a lot =
harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in,"=
 said Dan Schnur, a GOP analyst based in San Francisco.=20

can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego G=
as and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's ap=
proval.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.=20
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Ma=
gnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health S=
ervices to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their dir=
ectors are named in the lawsuit.=20
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.=20
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that =
liability?" he asked.=20
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committ=
ed $7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.=20
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and elect=
ric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies base=
d on those findings, he said.=20
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the=
 last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the sta=
ff of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.=20
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only =
a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.=20
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We pr=
epared (the report) for them. We are following their request."=20
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PU=
C officials were not available for comment.=20
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens=
us on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study import=
ant for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy=
 transmission lines, he said.=20
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to D=
avis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the stat=
e help build more power generators in California.=20
"They are extra nails in the coffin," said James Fisfis, spokesman for stat=

Texas power firm's shares falling=20
Power baron Enron finds fortunes fading=20

=20
There's trouble in Texas.=20
Enron Corp., the Houston power firm that's profited mightily during Califor=
nia's energy crisis, is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on Wall S=
treet.=20
While all eyes have been on Enron's enormous profits here and its enormous =
pull in Washington, D.C., the reputed titan of the newly incarnated, free- =
wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization -- more tha=
n $30 billion -- since its peak in August.=20
Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston b=
oys' reversal of fortunes. But what gives? Isn't this the company that was =
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents a=
nd state budget? Isn't this the company with such close ties to the Bush ad=
ministration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have inter=
viewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company?=
=20
Yup. That Enron.=20
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Ener=
gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power =
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for =
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at $=
90.=20
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with=
 in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal=
," said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities i=
n Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening he=
re is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people say=
ing, 'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "=20
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the Unite=
d States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the wo=
rld. Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as th=
e stock continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling is=
sued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" =
in its earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week,=
 closing at $44.05 yesterday.=20
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory=
 interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.=
=20
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they w=
ere a year ago."=20
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A =
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaki=
ng. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a woman wa=
s arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.=20
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with C=
alifornia's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of Relia=
nt Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate and se=
ll electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natural=
 gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.=20
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou=
t power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refun=
ds being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has =
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th=
e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nea=
rly 7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit =
as hard as Enron.=20
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any=
 company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because =
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline m=
akes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.=20
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm h=
as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other re=
gions in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enr=
on is that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so=
 secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel=
 confident in their understanding of what it does.=20
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.=20
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme=
nt of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dah=
bol Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped constructio=
n on a second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 milli=
on by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron =
of charging too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power fr=
om the plant last month.=20
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic ban=
dwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space, trea=
ting it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. But t=
he fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear t=
hat for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not been=
 enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage=
 of it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Bl=
ockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers at =
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it =
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.=20
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted aggress=
ive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its course=
. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this month and =
President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to =
the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls to =
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and=
 brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.=20
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no mor=
e than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours --=
 far short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly chargin=
g during the past year.=20
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of=
 the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company =
has a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But some=
times that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enr=
on had to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a=
 global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply =
the same way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized=
 their water systems. The opportunities never materialized.=20
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings =
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, whic=
h is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100 =
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First C=
all found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per sh=
are in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per share=
 on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.=20
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of =
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investo=
r, held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.=20
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager, s=
aid the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of negati=
ve psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus declined t=
o make fund managers available for interviews.=20
"There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets," said Raymo=
nd Niles, an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "When yo=
u're an aggressive first-mover, from time to time you're going to make mist=
akes. But I don't think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of =
the company."=20

Power firm accused of price-fixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed =
production of electricity to create an artificial shortage, boost profits  =
BY DION NISSENBAUM  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  SACRAMENTO -- One of th=
e largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw =
out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort to drive up the price =
of electricity, former power plant workers said Thursday.  Speaking out on =
the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing, the three men offered the=
 strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer -- Duke Energy -- =
sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have =
created huge electricity price spikes.  ``Their intent, in my opinion, was =
to boost the price up,'' said Glenn Johnson, a mechanic who worked for two =
decades at the Chula Vista power plant now run by Duke. ``If I've got the o=
nly box of penicillin in town and you're sick, I can charge a million dolla=
rs a box,'' he said. ``If you want to live, you're going to have to pay.'' =
 Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations, calling them irrespo=
nsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April.  ``Their al=
legations are just comical, just highly erroneous,'' said Tom Williams, a s=
pokesman for Duke, which runs four plants in California that produce enough=
 energy for nearly 2.6 million homes.  The charges come as the state heads =
into negotiations next week with generators over the $8.9 billion the state=
 claims its consumers have been overcharged. Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C.=
, came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the s=
tate a record $3,880 a megawatt-hour for power in January. Federal official=
s have called the charge unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California=
 the money.  The employees, who first made their allegations public on ``CB=
S Evening News'' Thursday night, will be the only witnesses today at an ene=
rgy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies hav=
e been illegally gouging California.  State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, =
chairman of a committee investigating price gouging, said the allegations r=
aise serious concerns. ``While we still need to hear the other side of the =
story from Duke, if there's any truth to the information, I believe it woul=
d be devastating to the generators,'' he said.  `Perfectly good parts'  In =
interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night, the three former plant wor=
kers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw=
 out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power for=
 weeks.  Ed Edwards, who worked in the Southern California plant, said that=
 he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts. Edwards said he =
tossed more than 23 pallets of parts into a dumpster.  ``I don't know why t=
hey were throwing away perfectly good parts,'' he said. ``It didn't make se=
nse.''  Johnson said the lack of on-site parts prevented workers from quick=
ly fixing problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce=
. Sometimes, he said, it took weeks to get parts.  Johnson's suspicions of =
gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer, who spent 18 years in the plant and w=
orked as an assistant control operator.  Even at times when California regu=
lators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough en=
ergy to prevent imminent blackouts, Olkjer said, he was directed to scale b=
ack the amount of electricity the plant was producing.  ``In hindsight, it =
looks to me like they were manipulating the power,'' Olkjer said.  Duke cal=
led the allegations ``baseless'' and said the workers didn't understand the=
 reasons for the actions. ``Continued accusations, repetitive investigation=
s and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the company's operations in the stat=
e are distracting attention from the true issue of solving California's ene=
rgy crisis,'' Duke said in a statement.  Williams did not directly dispute =
the worker's allegations. But he said they did not understand the reasons b=
ehind the decisions.  State directives  Duke cut back on the amount of powe=
r it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the I=
ndependent System Operator, which runs the power grid, Williams said.  ``Th=
ey did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet=
 supply and demand,'' he said.  An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manag=
er sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffi=
c on the transmission system or respond to the state's electricity needs.  =
Some companies ``bid'' power into the reserve market, which means these pla=
nts run only when the extra energy is tapped. ISO officials say they are pr=
ohibited from discussing individual bids.  As for the spare parts, Williams=
 said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from=
 San Diego Gas & Electric.  Williams said Duke has one of the best performa=
nce records in the state, with its power plants off-line for unscheduled ma=
intenance only about 1.1 percent of the time.  All three workers were given=
 severance packages and let go in April.  But Edwards disputed any contenti=
on that they were trying to get back at Duke.  ``I'm not a disgruntled empl=
oyee,'' he said. ``I'm just telling the truth of what I saw the last two ye=
ars I worked there.''  No matter what the reasons were for the decisions, D=
uke has made huge profits during the California energy crisis. And those pr=
ofits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives.  At one party, J=
ohnson said, executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune.  ``We're m=
aking more money than we ever thought possible,'' Johnson quoted the plant'=
s manager as saying.  Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed t=

Enron chief: Gov. Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE As=
sociated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California Gov. Gray Davis isn'=
t to blame for California's power crisis, and neither are electricity whole=
salers, a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of C=
alifornia.  Jeffrey Skilling, CEO and president of Houston-based Enron Corp=
., wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and plac=
ed the blame squarely on California's energy regulators.  The state Public =
Utilities Commission in the early 1990s put together a broken market by pre=
venting utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging pow=
er contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying last-minute power=
, Skilling said.  ``Because of these rules, the power consumers of the stat=
e of California were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market,'' Skil=
ling said.  PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators' actions la=
st week, saying utilities have been free to enter into long-term contracts.=
 Utilities countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would =
accept, which left open the possibility they would later be overruled.  ``I=
 think consumers in California are angry and they should be,'' Skilling sai=
d. ``Prices in California shouldn't be as high as they are.''  Skilling als=
o:  --Congratulated Davis for California's ``unprecedented'' conservation  =
--Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed=
 candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees in=
terstate energy markets  --Told the audience to expect a report that would =
show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to=
 the state  --Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likel=
y damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem  --Acknowledged =
that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provide cheaper power=
 to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off ex=
tra power despite public control  Enron has come under fire after accusatio=
ns from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced=
 electricity prices skyward by holding back supply.  Enron denies such clai=
ms, and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities=
 still owe them billions in unpaid bills. Davis acknowledges that Pacific G=
as & Electric Co., which has declared bankruptcy, and Southern California E=
dison together still owe generators such as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and =
Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past electricity sales.  ``Our succes=
s is linked to efficient markets, not higher prices in California or anywhe=
re else,'' Skilling said.  Protesters gathered outside the building wearing=
 pig masks and carrying hand-made signs, one of which read ``Greed is the o=
nly power crisis.''  ``It's basically Enron and the other companies raising=
 prices,'' said Bernard Greening, a Santa Clara computer programmer who sai=
d he's unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas.  Pet=
e Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say.  ``I believe =
the energy situation has been politicized so badly,'' Snoek said, saying he=
 was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting.=
 ``I hear the same people out there, as if it's a sin to make any money in =
this country.''  State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much a=
s $9 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000.  Companies hav=
e said California's claims are wildly exaggerated.  The Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California $12=
4 million in overcharges for the first four months of the year. Davis and o=
thers say that's a mere drop in the bucket.  Enron has also been tied to Pr=
esident Bush's hands-off approach to the energy crisis. Company chairman Ke=
nneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush =
and the GOP. Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stoc=
k in the company.  Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meet=
ing secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush adminis=
tration's energy plan.  Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, na=
tural gas and communications companies, with $101 billion in revenues in 20=
00. It owns 30,000 miles of pipeline, has 20,000 employees and is active in=
 40 countries. During the first quarter of this year, Enron's revenues incr=

Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San=

p electricity prices during the state's energy crisis.  The workers say the=
y will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today - the f=
irst public accounts from power plant employees of how energy production ma=
y have been manipulated.  Duke officials deny most of the allegations. The =
whistle-blowers - mechanics Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room o=
perator Jimmy Olkjer - lost their jobs four months ago.  State Sen. Joe Dun=
n, the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigative committee on pr=
ice-fixing, said his staff will attempt to verify the accounts from the whi=
stle-blowers. But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected=
 to set off a media circus. And if the accusations are true, it could have =
wide-ranging effects on the North Carolina company's operations in Californ=
ia. Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hear=
ing and have scheduled a news conference later today.  "They were doing all=
 kinds of things that didn't make sense," Johnson said in an interview. "Bu=
t if you asked them why, to explain, they told you to shut up and do your j=
ob."  The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund $10 million in overcharges fo=
r January 2001.  "This information lends credence to the concern that there=
 was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting pr=
ice," Dunn said. "What they are saying is disturbing."  Duke Energy spokesm=
an Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lost their jobs may b=
e shaping their testimony.  "The proof is in the pudding. Production is up =
and we've had fewer forced outages since we've taken over,'' said Williams.=
  But control-room logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Duke's =
trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce prod=
uction minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued. The logs are for Janua=
ry 2001 - the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in Californi=
a.  The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for =
more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. They l=
ost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant.  The three =
whistle-blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register.=
 The accusations include:  The company ordered workers to throw unopened bo=
xes of bolts, steam seals, valves and other parts into Dumpsters. The parts=
 were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available wh=
en repairs were required. Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were di=
scarded, but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order par=
ts as needed because they could be delivered within 24 hours.  Edwards and =
Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for=
 the generating units to run at full capacity. Because parts were thrown aw=
ay, they couldn't make repairs and generators ran at diminished capacity fo=
r days or weeks. Energy experts say this allegation, if true, would allow D=
uke to withhold energy from the marketplace, which could drive up the price=
. Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants =
and forced outages have decreased since they took over. But in late 2000, t=
here was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant, according to records =
kept by the state's power-grid operator. The plant reported 3,000 hours of =
outages from October through December. There were relatively few outages be=
fore that.  The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them =
to use a small, expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke =
took over the plant. Experts say that could have been used to exploit feder=
al rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units=
 online.  Olkjer says he received orders from Duke's trading arm to reduce =
production. Then, when energy prices jumped, he would get new instructions =
to power up again. Duke officials did not respond to Olkjer's claim.  Stanf=
ord professor Frank Wolak, an expert in California's energy market, said th=
at if their testimony can be proven, the state could be refunded millions o=
f dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced.  "What th=
ey are saying is amazing. This is a classic plot. I've always wondered how =
they kept the generators out for so long,'' said Wolak, who heads an electr=
icity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buyin=
g and selling of power. "They were very happy to have them off-line because=
 it allowed them to make more money.  Wolak said the testimony seems to bac=
k up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator, which run=
s most of the state's power grid and oversees the buying and selling of ele=
ctricity in California.  In a report to federal regulators, ISO said that f=
rom May to November 2000, Duke withheld electricity from the state's power =
grid 80 percent of the time. The report accused more than a dozen power pla=
nt companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketpl=
ace that would in turn drive up prices.  In a separate report, the state po=
wer grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January =
of this year, resulting in the $10 million refund order. Duke officials say=
 charging $3,880 a megawatt-hour was justified during a short period of tim=
e. Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have cha=
rged no more than $273 per megawatt-hour.  Williams, Duke's spokesman, said=
 that the company has been an ethical operator.  "All but 1.1 percent of th=
e time, we were operating. That's very good,'' said Williams, adding that w=
hen SDG&E owned the plant forced outages took place 1.8 percent of the time=
.  But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistle-blowers is true, an=
d Duke had the ability to manipulate prices, federal regulators would be re=
quired under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive mark=
etplace.  This would mean they would be moved back into a "cost-based" mark=
et structure and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of r=
eturn.  "This would bring the prices down dramatically in California,'' Dun=
n said. "What generators fear most is being returned to cost-based rate reg=

udge, Curtis Lee Wagner Jr., believes the players in Monday's megaconferenc=
e aren't dealing straight with each other, watch out.  "He's kind of like (=
President) Reagan -- a big-picture guy," says Patrick Wood, the newest fede=
ral energy commissioner who's known Wagner for years. "He can tell a story =
that always fits the situation." But cross him, and "he can slice you up li=
ke a Veg-O-Matic."  The 72-year-old Tennessee lawyer has been the Federal E=
nergy Regulatory Commission's chief judge for 22 years. His 47 years of gov=
ernment service includes being a lawyer with the military and Justice Depar=
tment.  And beginning Monday, he'll have California's electricity crisis in=
 his hands. All the players -- from the state to utilities to power generat=
ors -- will be in one room trying to settle who owes whom money and how muc=
h.  The state wants $9 billion in refunds from generators they say charged =
too much for electricity. The generators want billions from the utilities a=
nd the state that they say didn't pay the bill for other power they bought.=
 And California's ratepayers just want to keep the lights on.  "I don't thi=
nk there's $9 billion," Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headqu=
arters. "I think there may be a billion or so."  He spent much of the day f=
ielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in =
his hearing room Monday.  "Let's see, I've talked to Reliant, to Dynergy on=
ce, Mirant. I'm going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon. And I've tal=
ked to the governor's office, and I've talked to some FERC folks, to someon=
e from Oregon and some municipalities in California. Oh, and I've talked to=
 the fellow who is going to represent the city of Los Angeles."  Wagner lik=
es to know what he's getting into ahead of time. He makes a habit of talkin=
g to everyone individually.  Monday's is the kind of deal Wagner likes best=
. Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe, pounds the gavel and =
renders a decision after both sides make their cases, settlement conference=
s give him a chance to wheel and deal.  "First thing, I'll make an opening =
statement of some kind, give 'em a pep talk," Wagner said. "And if we have =
any big wheels there I'll let them say a thing or two."  After the introduc=
tions, he'll start to work through the issues. He'll take one guy aside, he=
 said, then maybe two. Then maybe a group. And little by little he hopes to=
 bring them together.  By all accounts this case could be more difficult th=
an any he has handled.  "This has got more dollars,'' Wagner said.  Thursda=
y, Wagner asked California's Independent System Operator and the power sell=
ers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues. He w=
ants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been =
had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of 2000. =
And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se=
ll - short and long term.  And as if his task wasn't difficult enough, FERC=
 has asked Wagner to make this deal in 15 days.  "It's pretty tight," he sa=
id, "but it can be done."  Stephen Angle, a Washington lawyer who represent=
s power producers and utilities, ran FERC's trial section for 14 years. The=
 California case is one of the most difficult he's seen. But he's not count=
ing Wagner out.  "I have learned that it's unwise to assume he won't be suc=
cessful," Angle said. The odds that Wagner will get a deal? "Fifty-fifty." =
 This is not the only high-profile case that's taking up the chief's time t=
hese days. He's presiding over a FERC inquiry into whether El Paso Energy C=
orp., a large natural gas pipeline owner, is overcharging California.  Wagn=
er has a history of taking impossible cases.  Angle says he recently worked=
 with the judge on a dispute in the Midwest.  "That was a case where few pe=
ople thought would be successful," Angle said. It had been on FERC's docket=
 for years. Wagner got the people talking and emerged with a settlement.  A=
nd Monday won't be Wagner's first effort at solving California's energy cri=
sis.  Last December, he got the parties together to try to break the logjam=
 over the long-term contracting issue. But just as he was getting a head of=
 steam on that, says Wood, the Clinton administration yanked the deal away =
from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves.  "I know he's too much of a =
gentleman to say it. But that was a missed opportunity."  Now he'll be reun=
iting some of the same parties that were together six months ago.  Because =
of Wagner's longevity on the bench, almost every lawyer or energy executive=
 who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some dealings with=
 him.  "He'll be very clear. He will not mince words," said former FERC Cha=
irman James Hoecker. "He will make his impatience with any dawdling very, v=
ery obvious to everyone.''   =09





      Davis seeks $9 billion refund  The governor tells a Senate panel that=
 power operators 'bilked our state.'  June 21, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and KATE=
 BERRY The Orange County Register  WASHINGTON - Gov. Gray Davis told anyone=
 here who would listen Wednesday that overcharges from what he calls greedy=
 power generators have now risen to $9 billion - $2 billion more than earli=
er reported.  And he wants that money back.  The governor said if the meeti=
ngs federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the dif=
ferences between power companies, utilities and the state do not end with t=
hat kind of money in California's pocket, he'll be back.  "They must be req=
uired to give us back our money,'' Davis told the Senate Government Affairs=
 Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning. It was the first =
time California's chief executive has testified on the state's crisis. "It =
is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bil=
ked our state for up to $9 billion."  The $9 billion is the amount Californ=
ia's Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and =
the state from May 2000 to May of this year. It had initially calculated th=
at between May 2000 and February 2001 there were $6.7 billion in overcharge=
s, Davis said. Those figures are a far cry from the $124 million that the F=
ederal Energy Regulatory Commission says were overcharges. That's because F=
ERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an =
energy alert.  The governor faced tough, pointed questioning from Republica=
n members and glowing praise and sympathy for his state's plight from Democ=
ratic colleagues.  Everything from refunds to long-term contracts will be o=
n the table at next week's settlement meeting. FERC has given the parties u=
ntil July 9 to make a deal.  If they can't, the administrative judge overse=
eing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC, which can order the payb=
acks. Sen. Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if =
FERC doesn't act.  Not surprisingly, generators don't see the refund issue =
the governor's way.  "It's just crazy," said Tom Williams, a spokesman at D=
uke Energy. "I don't know how they're coming up with these numbers."  And t=
here's skepticism about next week's talks.  "The negotiations are going to =
be like the SALT Treaty," said Gary Ackerman, president of the Western Powe=
r Trading Forum, which represents power suppliers. "I question whether it c=
an happen and work out."  Also at issue is money generators say they are ow=
ed by the utilities. Davis said that's about $2.5 billion. But power compan=
ies say it's more like $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion.  Whatever the figure, =
Davis said, "we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about=
 working anything out on their end."  The settlement conference was part of=
 FERC's order instituting around-the-clock price caps for California and it=
s 10 Western neighbors. Those price caps were made possible, experts agree,=
 because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the pub=
lic enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat.  The =
question is whether that can work with refunds.  "Pressure could come from =
a number of places," said Charles Cook, a nonpartisan political analyst who=
 has followed California's crisis. "It could come from Republican members f=
rom the state, from party donors in California who (President George W.) Bu=
sh is going to have to go back to, and then maybe from his economic adviser=
s who say that California can't be allowed to go belly up."  Davis and Sen.=
 Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said new FERC Commissioner Patrick Wood, a con=
fidant of Bush, has been receptive to their refund pleas. That was the case=
 Wednesday when Wood - expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this yea=
r - told members of the Senate panel that refunds "may be an important tool=
 in the regulatory toolbox. If we're to be a vigilant market cop, we need t=
o make sure that our bite matches our bark."  Wood and the other new commis=
sioner, Nora Mead Brownell, will meet with Davis in Sacramento on Monday.  =

      Energy notebook  Blackouts are still a hot prospect, officials warn  =
June 21, 2001  By the Associated Press  BERKELEY - Experts at the Universit=
y of California Energy Institute say residents statewide should not be comf=
orted by the fact that widespread blackouts have been avoided recently.  "I=
 would say this is not a great sign that we're going to skate by later this=
 summer," said Severen Borenstein, a UC Berkeley economist who heads the in=
stitute. "It doesn't look like the system right now can handle a blazing, h=
ot day. If it's real hot in Northern and Southern California, we're going t=
o have blackouts."  Greg Fishman, a spokesman for the California Independen=
t System Operator, which controls the state's electricity grid, said ISO pr=
eferred to look on the bright side.  "Does the fact that we're meeting elec=
tricity demand today mean we're out of the woods? No, but is the fact that =
we're meeting demand today good? Sure it is," Fishman said.  Air conditione=
rs are the single biggest factor in summer electricity demand.  "If thermos=
tats on air conditioners were turned to 78 degrees across the state, this p=
roblem would pretty much go away," Borenstein said.  Davis' plan to buy SDG=
&E grid has fans and critics  SAN DIEGO - Gov. Gray Davis' plan for the sta=
te to buy San Diego Gas & Electric Co.'s transmission system, owned by pare=
nt company Sempra Energy, is getting mixed reaction.  Under the plan unveil=
ed Monday, the state would buy the system for $1 billion, and a $747 millio=
n debt owed to the utility by its customers would be forgiven.  "It would s=
eem that anything that in the short term lets the ratepayers off the hook, =
particularly small businesses that can ill afford drastic balloon payments,=
 is a good thing," said Suzanne Strassburger of Escondido's Downtown Busine=

r Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, called the deal "a cruel joke on the part o=
f Gov. Davis to say that he's burst the balloon payment, because we're goin=

ssion lines."  GE tries to enter state's transmission-lines business  SACRA=
MENTO - Through an alliance with a little-known start-up company, General E=
lectric Co. is trying to enter California's transmission- lines business.  =
Although Trans-Elect, a 2-year-old company based in Washington, has no expe=
rience in the transmission business, it has the financial support of GE's $=
66 billion financial arm, GE Capital. Trans-Elect's latest offer comes as G=
ov. Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmiss=
ion lines of both San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. =
 Any involvement by GE in the state's transmission grid could be a conflict=
 of interest, said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end California's p=
ower crisis.  "You've got someone with generation and transmission systems,=
 how do they keep them separate and do they?" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley,=
 D-Boulder Creek. "That's a concern for me. Would they have the ability to =
restrict competitors' access to transmissions?"  Bob Mitchell, Trans-Elect'=

ature won't approve the deals to buy the two utilities' lines.  GE joined f=

      In rolling blackouts, 'together' is all relative  June 21, 2001  I ha=
ve a confession to make: I'm an N001. And as an N001 I can't help feeling a=
 little guilty.  I feel guilty that I won't be called upon to share the pai=
n of all those A001s in  Irvine and Laguna Woods, or the M003s in Costa Mes=
a and Cypress. While the M011s in Fountain  Valley suffer and sweat through=
 rolling blackouts, I'll be sitting pretty.  Because I'm an N001. And the d=
irty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out =
there.  Allow me to explain.  As you may have heard, Southern California Ed=
ison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling b=
lackouts. If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling=
 blackouts, you can go to a Web site (www.sce.com ) or call a toll-free pho=
ne number (800-611-1911) to see if your "rotating outage group" is on the l=
ist for going temporarily dark.  How do you know which group you're in? On =
your Edison power bill, next to your account number, there's a code that st=
arts with A or M - A001, A002, M001, M002 and so on. That's your outage gro=
up number.  But wait. There's another category of outage group. If your pow=
er bill has the code number N001 on it, it means that you're exempt from ro=
lling blackouts.  You see, under Public Utilities Commission rules, electri=
c power customers who provide "essential public health, safety and security=
 services" - such as fire and police stations, hospitals, jails and so on -=
 are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts, even if they have emergen=
cy generators on site. And because of the way electric power service is set=
 up, anybody who's on the same circuit with an essential service provider i=
s also exempt from rolling blackouts.  For example, my house shares a circu=
it with a fire station. So I'm an exempt N001, as are the other power custo=
mers on the same circuit.  But here's the kicker: According to an Edison sp=
okesman, 50 percent of all Edison customers are N001s - that is, they share=
 circuits with essential service providers, and thus are currently exempt f=
rom rolling blackouts.  Let me repeat that: Half of all Edison customers ar=
e exempt from rolling blackouts. (For San Diego Gas & Electric customers it=
's 40 percent.)  Mind you, this isn't something Edison likes to publicize. =
When I asked about it for a column three months ago, Edison said it didn't =
know how many power customers are automatically exempt. And when the compan=
y unveiled its blackout warning plan this week, neither the Edison press re=
lease nor news reports mentioned the 50 percent exemption figure.  True, ev=
en exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts - at work, a=
t the store, at a traffic light.  Still, the next time you hear some power =
company or government official say, "We're all in this together," don't bel=
ieve it. When it comes to rolling blackouts, the truth is that only half of=
 us are really all in this together.  And even an N001 can see that isn't f=
air.    =09
