Mark and Steve,

Attached is the latest approved release from us.  While I understand that
the banks may have an issue with Dynegy's view on the equity infusion as
the headline; for us, it's critical.  Affirming what we've already
committed to day in and day out (including over the weekend, is a
non-event.

For our part, Chuck still needs to sign off after you've run this by the
banks.  If all goes well, we'll get this out as early as possible before
market open.
