Dynegy and Enron
Announce Merger=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from Reuters] Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) agreed on Nov. 9 to acquir=
e rival Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) for some $9 billion in stock, underlining t=
he dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houston-based energy trading giant=
 that was valued last year at nearly $80 billion. Enron's stock fell sharpl=
y in the past month due to investors' concerns about murky transactions tha=
t sparked an investigation by U.S. regulators and damaging downgrades by cr=
edit rating agencies. The merged company will retain the Dynegy name. It wi=
ll have annual revenues of more than $200 billion and assets worth $90 bill=
ion, including more than 22,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacit=
y and 25,000 miles of natural-gas pipelines. It will be North America's big=
gest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity, positions previous=
ly held by Enron.

Analysis: Well, it's now official. The announcement of what presumably will=
 be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end o=
f last week. It is indeed a dramatic end. Enron, the maverick and innovativ=
e company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated m=
arkets in the energy industry, will no longer exist after what has been a v=
ery quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months. Dy=
negy, the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach=
 toward success, is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and l=
ocking in much of the industry market share of Enron. Can there be any doub=
t that this is the energy industry's manifestation of the tortoise and the =
hare parable? Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy, but is making a sm=
art choice to be bought, considering its desperate circumstances and the un=
likelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own. For Dynegy, this=
 acquisition is a major win, as the combination will create the biggest and=
 strongest energy merchant in the world.=20

There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal. Before addre=
ssing some issues related to the approval of the deal, let's establish some=
 of the key points of the merger agreement. There have been some mixed repo=
rts, but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about $10=
 a share, quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was tra=
ding at close to $90 a share and had a market value of nearly $70 billion. =
Under terms of the agreement, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 Dynegy=
 shares per share of Enron common stock. Dynegy's current stockholders (inc=
luding ChevronTexaco Corp., which currently owns 27 percent of Dynegy) will=
 own approximately 64 percent of the combined company, while Enron's stockh=
olders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company's stock at=
 closing.=20

In addition, Dynegy will provide an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equ=
ity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes=
, followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined comp=
any by ChevronTexaco. Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy, will retain=
 his position at the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, and=
 Rob Doty, chief financial officer, will retain their positions at the new =
company. It is not presently known what role, if any, Ken Lay, current CEO =
of Enron, will hold at the new company.=20

Of course, this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fal=
len into a very vulnerable spot this year. Quite literally, Enron was pushe=
d into this deal because it was running out of cash, its stock had tanked a=
nd its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels, all within the last=
 several weeks. Enron's decline over the course of 2001 has been the result=
 of losses in its telecom sector, losses from its involvement in India, the=
 departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission (SEC) investigation into some of its business practices, and lack =
of investor confidence about Enron's honesty in its financial reporting. Th=
is last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had ov=
erstated earnings by 20 percent over the last four years and investors shou=
ld disregard the company's financial statements from 1997 through the first=
 half of 2001. The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced=
 $591 million from Enron's reported profits. In addition, Enron revised its=
 debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000. At the end of 2000, Enron's de=
bt was $10.86 billion, $628 million more than it had previously reported. B=
y not reporting this debt earlier, Enron presumably was able to maintain a =
stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been dis=
closed.=20

The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enron's successful energy t=
rading business. In addition, Dynegy could also find synergies in Enron's r=
etail unit, Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline, the company's electronic=
 trading unit. Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect, whi=
ch was launched after Enron gained the first-strike advantage in this marke=
t space. Details are still emerging, but it would make sense if Dynegy opte=
d to not purchase other units under Enron's business structure, such as the=
 company's water and telecom businesses, which are losing money. Dynegy has=
 its own telecom unit, which has also lost money this year, so it may not w=
ant to expand in this slow-growing sector at this time. Vivendi Environneme=
nt, a French company that has expanded into various lines of business, has =
reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix, Enro=
n's struggling water subsidiary. Note that Enron sold Azurix North America =
to American Water Works.=20

The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dyn=
egy and Enron shareholders. Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent u=
pon any possible downgrades on its long-term debt that Dynegy could encount=
er with the purchase of Enron. At this juncture, it does not appear that Dy=
negy will be downgraded, but this is a fast-changing story and conditions c=
ould change abruptly. Financing the deal may also be an issue, even with th=
e infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco. Dynegy reportedly has $3 billion =
worth of debt and has a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Thus, Enron=
's own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb, a=
 concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal. This issue co=
uld be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enron's assets and =
if there is some repair work done on Enron's balance sheets.=20

The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult, as the combination of =
the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market po=
wer and antitrust issues. The review of this merger will be unprecedented, =
considering that the wholesale natural-gas and electricity trading market i=
s still fairly young. Certainly, a deal of this magnitude has not previousl=
y occurred in the deregulating energy industry. It is not presently clear w=
hich regulatory agency will be involved in the review, although the Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Federal Trade Commission and the =
Justice Department could all be involved. FERC would most likely become inv=
olved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset, su=
ch as a pipeline. FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured so=
lely as an exchange of stock. Not involving FERC would be more advantageous=
 for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly s=
horter.=20

An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items fo=
r regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dyne=
gy would hold market power in the natural-gas trading space, which could pr=
e-empt market entry by other competitors. The combined company would be con=
siderably larger than its nearest competitors. Scope and scale are consider=
ed the top competitive assets in the trading sector, and the combination of=
 Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance. It will fa=
ll on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it p=
recludes other competitors from emerging into the same space.=20

To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatem=
ent. The two rival companies followed very different paths to success. Enro=
n, under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular, espoused an unor=
thodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order=
 to achieve success in the energy-trading space. Dynegy, on the other hand,=
 approached the market from the opposite perspective, and diligently acquir=
ed diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally t=
o support its trading operation. Up until the start of 2001, it appeared th=
at Enron's strategy was the more successful of the two. Enron, with $100 bi=
llion in revenues and $1 billion in profits in 2000, ranked fifth on Fortun=
e 500's list of largest U.S. companies. In contrast, Dynegy ranked 54 on th=
e same list and had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings. H=
owever, 2000 turned out to be Dynegy's year and the success continued into =
2001, the very year that would bring Enron's downfall. Enron's problems cul=
minated in $638 million in losses in the third quarter, after taking $1.01 =
billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. Take=
n with the other factors plaguing the company, Enron became exceptionally v=
ulnerable and prone to a takeover, which has now provided Dynegy with a str=
ong gain.=20

The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegy's size and should imm=
ediately provide an accretive earnings contribution. Further, Dynegy claims=
 that it expects a 15- to 20-percent annual earnings growth over the next t=
hree years following its planned acquisition of Enron. If it gains all of t=
he necessary regulatory approvals, Dynegy will become the undisputed market=
 leader in the energy industry, with annual revenues of $200 billion and $9=
0 billion in assets. The company will have 22,000 MW of generating capacity=
, which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating=
 70,000 MW by 2005. In other words, the combined company will dwarf any oth=
er competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its neare=
st competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size, resources an=
d assets.=20

Word of the acquisition caused Enron's shares to increase some, one of the =
few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months. S=
hares of Enron rose 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $8.85 in mid-day trade on =
the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. As of early morning trade on Nov. 12=
, Enron shares were priced at $9.40. Shares of Dynegy gained $2.24, or 5.8 =
percent, to $41 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
