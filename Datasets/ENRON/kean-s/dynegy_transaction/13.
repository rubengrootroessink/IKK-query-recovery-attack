We're drafting a quick memo to the bankers on the revised release.
 
We will forward it to you for thoughts and then we'll all talk.

Debbie,
Got it, thanks.
On the issue of the headline and subheads, the news in my opinion is that the deal has been recut and we've all agreed to new terms. This is just a thought, but we say in the last paragraph "As part of the revised merger agreement," but we never say anywhere higher up in the release that two sides have agreed to revised terms. It seems like the lede is buried given that it has already leaked that JPM and Citi would provide new money. 
 
Anyway, we're in agreement that we want to get this out before the market oagreement that we want to get this out before the market pens, and I will start calling banks at 6 AM NY time. 
 
Best,
Steve

Mark and Steve,

Attached is the latest approved release from us. While I understand that the banks may have an issue with Dynegy's view on the equity infusion as the headline; for us, it's critical. Affirming what we've already committed to day in and day out (including over the weekend, is a non-event.

For our part, Chuck still needs to sign off after you've run this by the banks. If all goes well, we'll get this out as early as possible before market open.
