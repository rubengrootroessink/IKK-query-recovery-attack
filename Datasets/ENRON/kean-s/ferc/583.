Please provide comments on the draft show cause order by COB Monday 9/10.  There may be a revised version out later today with Steve W. and some other comments incorporated after yesterday's phone call.  Final draft should be ready Tues. or Wed. and we will have a conference call late Wed afternoon to finalize.  It can then be shopped at FERC (Linda/Sarah -- can you gather a list of who to contact at FERC?)  Also, Steve and Rick will take it to the Commissioner meetings on 9/17.  

We want to have some press coverage when we file (Janel to handle?)
Paul is going to clear this with PGE deal folks
Paul needs to give a heads up to Western govs when we file
We can provide it the day before or day of filing to some groups:  Ideas
-EPSA
-ELCON, Steel group, etal. (filed this week to support FERC mandating a single Midwest RTO)
-Nat'l Rural Elec. Coop (Glenn English recently gave a speech requesting a fully integrated grid)
-These groups filed to make Alliance get an independent board (Janine-would they be helpful?):  Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers, Industrial Energy Users-Ohio; WVa Energy Users Group; Assoc. of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity; Citizens Action Coalition of Ind; Izaak Walton League of North America; Environmental Law and Policy Center
-Some coops and munis represented by Speigal and McDiarmid in DC and Miller Balis & ONeill in DC (EPMI signed on to their filing against the NC PUC's request for stay of the SE RTO mediation)

Contains Steve's comments                                 plus, we are changing the MBRs test to state that OATT is not enough to mitigate transmission market power -- need to agree to join RTO as finally ordered per 7/12 orders.  Thanks
