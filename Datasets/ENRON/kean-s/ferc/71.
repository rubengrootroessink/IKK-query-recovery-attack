FYI-- "E" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder 
Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but 
the FPA has similar penalty provisions for "knowing and willful" violations.  
Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like 
Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to 
the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the 
concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it 
cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about 
it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric 
companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties.
