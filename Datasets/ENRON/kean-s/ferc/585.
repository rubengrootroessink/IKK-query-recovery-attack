Steve,
	We are still in the final preparations for the hearing tomorrow.
Here is the information that I have available right now about ripple claims.


Order of Magnitude
	Obviously the amount of the net ripple claim is determined by the
reference price that is used.  We have done the calculations for three
different reference prices:  ISO (August 9th), Seattle ("Fair Price") and
Tacoma ("Market Price).  The net ripple claims under these different
reference prices range from $125M (ISO) to $370 (Seattle).  The gross amount
of Enron's ripple claims is from $1.2B to $3.1B.

I have asked for a counterparty breakout of rippleclaim estimates from
Charles River and should have that for you tomorrow.

If you have questions, you can reach me on my cell phone a (415) 279-2770.

Thanks
Gary

Steve - see attached list of ripple claimants - there could be more - I
will try to get a complete list by Tuesday.  Also, Gary Fergus is
compiling a list of entities that sold to Enron and the ripple refund
amounts.  Gary, please send the list to Steve directly - thanks.
