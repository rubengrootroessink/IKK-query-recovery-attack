Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI 
encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is 
OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take 
that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick 
handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington.  

Joe--Would this be helpful to provide to Kevin Madden?
