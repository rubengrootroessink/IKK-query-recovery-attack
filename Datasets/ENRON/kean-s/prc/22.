Some very nice, and very appropriate thoughts about John Ambler.  Wade 
continues to speak the truth.

Mark,

I wanted to pass on to you what I've said to John Ambler -- he is doing a 
great job for us (and all of Enron) in some very trying times that the Dabhol 
project is facing. These tough times will undoubtedly remain for some time, 
and I really appreciate the support we receive from your team led by John.

Wade

John,

In the midst of all the e-mails we exchange -- I think I've sent a few more 
tonight with my comments on various releases -- I want to take a moment and 
say that I really appreciate the job you do for us. It's easy to focus so 
much on the problems I face in balancing the India issues with the Houston 
issues and forget that you are doing the exact same thing except with a 
higher level of interaction with both senior management and the external 
world than I. Plus you are in close enough proximity to those folks that they 
can do physical harm to you. I always have the benefit of having at least 20 
hours advance notice so I can hide.

Keep up the good work, and hang in there. Please let me know if I can do 
anything to help you continue to provide the great support you deliver to us. 
As we go forward, especially in this time of increased international press 
and shareholder scrutiny, I'll try and be as responsive as possible.

Regards,
Wade
