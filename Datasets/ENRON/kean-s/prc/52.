Dear Mark and Steve,

It is with great pleasure that I can write this letter about some of Enron's most outstanding employees.  I am referring to Dennis Vegas and his team.  I would like to emphasize how supportive he and his group have been to me.  

Dennis has taken the time to join our Monthly Staff Meetings, as well as be a guest speaker at our meetings.  Dennis and his group have successfully worked with me to have a plasma screen placed in the Plaza Reception area for our Experience Enron customers.  He continues to keep my group informed with up-to-date information about the company.  Dennis has the type of positive attitude that is needed to get the job done in our company.

I would like to commend Dennis and his team for the concentration and attentiveness given to our group.  Not only is he doing his usual good job, he also goes the extra mile and I appreciate his efforts.  

Brenda Anderson
