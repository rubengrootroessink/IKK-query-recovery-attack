As a follow-up to our discussion at the June 29 HR PRC meeting, attached is criteria for using the Senior Director level that was established/agreed to by the ETS executive officers in May, 2001.  The need for this criteria was discussed at the final year-end 2000 ETS PRC meeting and agreement was reached prior to the mid-year 2001 PRC meetings.  The criteria was used in the final mid-year ETS PRC meeting on June 28.  There were no new Senior Directors approved at mid-year for ETS.
