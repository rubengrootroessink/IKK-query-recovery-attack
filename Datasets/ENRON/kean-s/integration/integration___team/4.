Steve,

I had the opportunity to work with you during the Rice University Day-2 interviews last month (I hope you remember).  It was our first time working together, and I enjoyed our interaction.  

As we go forward with the Dynegy merger, I would like to offer my services as part of the transition team.  From April of 1999 until June of 2001, I was a key leader in EES's transition team for outsource contracts.  While I recognize that the EES contracts and the Dynegy merger are not the same, I have the fundamentals, know our businesses, and can make significant contributions, if given the chance.

If you are interested in having me as part of the team, great; and if not, as they say in basketball, "no harm, no foul."

Best Regards,

Kurt Wangenheim
Sr. Director
EES
