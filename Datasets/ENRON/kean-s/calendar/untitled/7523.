Here are two typical comments I've received.  We left our allies hanging out 
there  -- not ot mention some of our staff.

From Carl Imparato:


This is very depressing.  And Enron's credibility is suffering greatly
(and probably deservedly) in ERCOT and other areas.  Sounds like Ron
McNamara and Kevin Presto have turned things around 180 degrees.  My
hope is that we (all of the still-unconverted true believers) can nail
down RTOWest and DSTAR before Enron can undo all of the successes in
those RTOs.

From Elena Schmid, VP, CA ISO

WHat do I hear about Enron giving up on California and adopting PJM?  What 
happened in ERCOT?   I've had calls from many people asking me why the CAL 
ISO is holding on to this zonal notion when even Enron has given up.
