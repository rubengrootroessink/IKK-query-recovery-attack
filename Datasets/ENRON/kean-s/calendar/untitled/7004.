		 Subject: Information Management - A Steve Kean sponsored initiative

Per Steve Kean's direction, Enron has commissioned a small task force team to 
1) Implement a yahoo-like web entry point (portal) to Enron's universe of 
intranets, external search tools and extranet sites, 2) Develop a 
pilot/prototype of a qualitative data retrieval tool and 3) Document a 
proposed strategy for Knowledge Management/Information Management.  I am 
currently chairing this task force and I need your input to enable the team 
to gather information about what content should be accessible from a website.

Below are a few questions which I would like your input. Please take a few 
minutes to provide your input and return your thoughts to my attention no 
later than Thursday, January 4th.

Thank you for your time and support
Marie Hejka
