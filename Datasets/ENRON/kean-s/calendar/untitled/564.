First
As you will see in the agenda,  a GDF representative will be giving a brief 
presentation at the very start of the Briefing   This person will highlight: 
Where GDF stands now in the market place 
What their rates are and how they stack up against the competition
What they hope to get out of Monday's meeting with Enron

NOTE - Past briefings have shown that it is very beneficial to have all Enron 
participants attend at least the first 30 minutes of a briefing to be 
introduced and to also hear the visitor's overview and it's relationship 
building.

GDF attendees will receive a Welcome Package to include a color bound copy of 
the presentation, Note pad, Enron Profile and Enron Annual Report.

Lastly:
Restatement of Briefing Objectives and Theme

Purpose of the Visit:
For Gaz de France - 
To develop some insight in to what a competitive market place may mean for 
their domestic operations.  They want to learn from Enron's gas deregulation 
experiences.  

For Enron - 
Educate them on Enron's gas deregulation experiences and the outcome of the 
U.S. gas pipeline restructuring.
Help them to understand why they should embrace open access in order to help 
speed up open access in France.

Enron Messages:
Overall Message:
Incumbent utilities with the right (progressive) approach can not only 
survive but thrive under an open access regime.  The way to win is not by 
dragging your feet and trying to protect historical markets but embracing the 
change.  
Prior to open access
Emphasis on how bad things were prior to open access (the market moved from 
surplus to shortage/major commodity price swings and exposure to price risk)
After open access
Enron (even our regulated businesses) grew dramatically because the company 
embraced open access (throughput increased 40 to 50% w/o pipeline expansion)
Enron treated the transport business like a business, viewing producers and 
marketers as customers.


Thanks for your participation and contribution. See ya there.
