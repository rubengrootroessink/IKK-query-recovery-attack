I've done some research in relation to securing a 1-800 # for Project Summer 
and the following steps will need to be taken if we decide to move forward 
with this:

We must establish where the 1-800 # is going to ring.  For example, it must 
ring through at an assigned 5  digit extension (i.e. similar to all internal 
Enron extensions) that the Enron Move Team will have to create (1 day).

AT&T must be informed of the designated extension # to set up the 1-800 # and 
to electronically route the 1-800 # to that point (typically 10-14 days BUT 
they do offer 1-800 #s for emergencies - i.e. disaster areas - which they can 
set up in 2-3 days).  If we do move forward, I imagine that we will request 
this 2-3 day set up service, since we have already past meeting the 10-14 day 
deadline).

Our internal telephone department must be informed of how many tiers we would 
like on the system for the correct software to be written - this will take 
2-3 days.  For example, I believe we would like callers to have language 
options and business unit options - tier one, may sound as follows: "You have 
reached....press 1 for CALME, press 2 for APACHI, etc."  Then the second tier 
may sound as follows: "...press 1 for Spanish, press 2 for Portugese, etc."

Will we need to recruit staff internally, who represent the required spectrum 
of languages, to listen to the voice mail messages and email the questions to 
the appropriate business unit PR contact for responses?


Overall Timing

Move team = 1 day
AT&T  = 3 days (simultaneously with tiers)
Tiers  = 3 days (simultaneously with AT&T)

Total  = 4 days

 
Overall Cost

AT&T Toll # Cost  = $10.00

AT&T Install   = $10.00

International Long Distance Dialing Minutes (based on country call is placed 
from) = $ Varies

Move team   = few hundred $

Tiers    = couple of thousand $

Total for components = $3,000 + variable international long distance charges 
based on volume of calls


I hope I haven't left anything out...if so, please contact me via email or 
voice mail x 3-5670.
