Steve,

Thanks for the phone call a couple of weeks ago.  My wife and I will have a
chance to see Houston this weekend as part of Enron's Sell Weekend.  A team
of Enron employees including some Darden alums has planned many activities
for us this weekend.  It's a great opportunity for her to know the city and
I am sure we'll have a good time.  Hope everything is well.
