Subject:  Background Information France Electricity



Background

The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate=
d=20
monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n=
ow=20
have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20
emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=
=20
risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=
=20
proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=
0%=20
tolerance level or 5MW.=20

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=
he=20
availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=
=20
balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=
=20
effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=
=20
blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=
l=20
transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=
=20
of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=
=20
the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20
Resources Limited ("ECTRL") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=
=20
closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=
he=20
very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20

Future Developments

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20
trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=
=20
with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=
=20
over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=
=20
release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=
=20
the further development of the market.

Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=
=20
(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=
=20
balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20
services.
=20
Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=
=20
However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met.=20

Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=
al=20
capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou=
t=20
30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20
contribute to increase liquidity.=20

Regulatory Environment

The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=
y=20
is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20
gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness =
in=20
the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=
=20
certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=
l=20
of liberalisation still exist.=20

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=
an=20
required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=
ss=20
(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20
transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20
current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=
ar=20
and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20
Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=
=20
consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=
r=20
market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20
direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=
nt=20
declined a quicker opening of the power market.

The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=
on=20
de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20
ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=
r=20
non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=
=20
tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=
=20
IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20

RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=
=20
Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20
allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=
=20
levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20
players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20
regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=
d=20
imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=
=20
and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=
=20
is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20
request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =
of=20
the Ministry of Industry, the main route for authorisation. Authorised IPPs=
=20
in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers =
a=20
maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% =
of=20
the installed capacity, including long term contracts. Although the=20
interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M. Tuot,=20
Director General of the CRE, implies that these restrictions only apply to=
=20
French authorised producers and thus not to foreign-based energy companies =
or=20
other non-producing entities. Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=
L,=20
as we are not registered in France.  In addition, French IPPs are free to=
=20
sell and export their production.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a balancing responsibility contract=
=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are free of transmission=
=20
charges. =20

A network code is currently under discussion between market players and=20
RTE.      =20

Market Conventions

A range of wholesale electricity products are currently traded in France. =
=20
Peak and baseload day-ahead, week-ahead, monthly, quaterly, and yearly=20
products are traded.  Peak products follow the German convention (12 hour=

Gate closure for scheduling imports, exports and transits is 14h00 Paris=20

Other: The Gas Market

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted for mid 2002), and it i=
s=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was published on 13 July 2000 by=20
GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to be=
=20
developed for 2003. Charges for imbalances are expensive and access to=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=

=20
The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=

Updated May 2001.

1)Background

France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.=
=20
EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th=
e=20
world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20
historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power =
in=20
Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the=
=20
French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20
nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation=
=20
represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.=
=20

A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such=
=20
as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell=
=20
their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan=
t=20
development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20
installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe=
r=20
generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is "preferable" the=20
correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20
Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=
=20
apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.
More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession area.

2) Regulatory Environment

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20
regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=
he=20
law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.=
=20
Dozens  ["Dozens"  - I would replace this with "Several")  of application=
=20
decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=
=20
The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=
=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20
auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20
clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=
=20
per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20
French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.

Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio=
n=20
of customers located in their concession area. =20
A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three year contractual framework. =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision=
=20
from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.=
=20
Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t=
o=20
eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20
including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio=
ns=20
of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20
restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in=
=20
France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional=
=20
regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a=
=20
matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u=
p=20
to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=
=20
available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=
=20
about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20
eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20
created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20
d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen=
t=20
eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a programme responsible contract=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
It is likely that this new tariff will implement a 1/3 injection-2/3 delive=
ry=20
calculation factor. Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are=
=20
free of transmission charges. =20

Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in=20
France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another.  Enron=
=20
Capital & Trade Resources Limited ("ECTRL")  is programme responsible in=20
France. Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a first-come-first=
=20
served basis rule by RTE, and congestion fees are levied at the margin, whi=
ch=20
favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player=
s.=20
In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R=
TE=20
real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports and imports. This=
=20
allocation rule is likely to change by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is=20
likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =
=20

The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato=
ry=20
body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20
eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20
      =20
3) Business Opportunity

Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=
y=20
to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through real-time=
=20
arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process, market prices=
=20
and optional structures. The establishment of programme responsible contrac=
ts=20
has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in=
=20
France. ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early=
=20
2000, and was the very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in Franc=
e=20
late 2000. =20

An intraday market is now effective for transits, imports and exports, and =
is=20

4) Future Development=20

It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b=
e=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio=
=20
of contacts (producer,consumer), thus providing RTE with physical balancing=
=20
capacity. The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for=
=20
balancing services.=20

The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse.=20
However, due to the dominant position of EdF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met. ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa=
ir=20
and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has=20
actively contributed for a spot market to take place.

However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,=
=20
imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market=
=20
will develop rapidly.        =20

5) The Gas Market Situation

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is=
=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20=
00=20
by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to=
=20
be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t=
o=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=
re=20
located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.=
=20
The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=
e=20
conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps.
As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20
approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic=
=20
legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and=
=20
the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry.   =20
Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to=20
customers from new entrants, it is already possible to optimise gas supply=
=20
through import of blocs for part or full supply. ECTRL was the first new=20
entrant to supply gas at the French border, and more recently into France.=

Point 1.5: This info is of a preliminary nature and is subject to change. I=
n=20
addition, it is mentioned in point 6 that registered companies for the=20
auction will have the opportunity to ask questions and raise issues during=
=20
conferences, which will be then considered by EdF.

Specifications of the auction will be finalised by end August. This seems t=

leave some room for a complete feedback from registered companies. Let's=20
discuss the content of the PIM.

I suggest to arrange anothe meeting with PWC/Rothschild in the next few wee=
ks=20
(week 11-16 June).=20

What about a potential meeting with the Trustee about the PIM?

Bruno,

Quel surprise.  Should make your follow up with the MTF interesting as to t=
he=20
role of the Trustee.

One point to note for both MTF and Albers at COMP - the lack of within day=
=20
flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting developme=
nt=20
of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand.  Suppliers will thus=
=20
be at the mercy of EdF in the balancing market.

In addition, how on earth can they be allowed to take 2 years to complete t=
he=20
process?  How does that fit with merger remedy?

Somewhat ironic that they have the document in English!

Lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have spoken with MTF.

Regards,

Ross

Obviously a done deal - interestingly the Trustee is not mentioned. EDF has=

the capacity offering on its web page=20

that flexibility is not a option (nomination at noon, and price has not=20

31/05/01 UK: EDF ISSUES DETAILS OF ITS FIRST CAPACITY AUCTION.
LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - French utility Electricite de France (EdF)=20
announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity=20
production capacity to competitors. EdF was required by the EU Commission i=

EU approval of its purchase of a 25 percent stake in German utility EnBW.
In the next two years, EdF will auction a total of 6,000 megawatts which=20
include 1,000 MW of peak capacity sold at a price of 26 euros per megawatt=
=20
hour (MWh) and 4,000 MW of baseload at a price of eight euros/MWh.
In addition, 1,000 MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made=20
available. Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smalle=
r=20
producers under long-term contracts.
"With such contracts, electricity suppliers and traders will be able to hav=
e=20
electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power=
=20
plant," said EdF in a statement.
The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before=
=20
the auction as it depends on gas price movements, EdF said.
The auction will take place in several tranches, the first one starting in=

ad=20
