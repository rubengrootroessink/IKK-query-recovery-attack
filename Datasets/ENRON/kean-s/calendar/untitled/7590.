Rick:

As agreed I have put down some thoughts summarizing how to proceed on these
issues (see attachment). I have kept the schedule as tight as possible given
the urgency in responding publicly. Let me know what you think.

I don't have everyone's email here (I am at home) so perhaps Ginger can
circulate it to Steve, Ron, etc. as appropriate.

By the way if you ever want to reach me you can try (617) 513-5904, which is
a cellphone that I generally have with me (but very rarely give out the
number).

Seabron --

I hear that you are coming to Houston to discuss market structure on
Friday.  Here are some thoughts we put together related to the Alliance /
MISO debate for you to consider.
