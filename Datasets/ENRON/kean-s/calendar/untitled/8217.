State might balk on power: But refusing to pay 'ridiculous' prices could ad=
d=20
to crisis.
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published April 20, 2001)=20
Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts, the state water department said=
=20
Thursday it might not pay "ridiculous" prices for electricity even if that=
=20
leaves California short of power.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for th=
e=20
state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out wha=
t=20
it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be=20
better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation=20
programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the=
=20
department's deputy director in charge of power purchases.=20
Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: "We will continue to keep th=
e=20
lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see,=
=20
how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I=
=20
can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost=
=20
later."=20
But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is=
=20
contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. "At what point do=
es=20
the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under=20
discussion," Maviglio said.=20
The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern=
=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to=20
purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax tha=
t=20
stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har=
t=20
said.=20
That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20
electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20
Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which ge=
ts=20
its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20
department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har=
t=20
said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand.=
=20
"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be=
=20
made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there," Hart said.=20
The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling=
=20
blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy=
=20
ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20
"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards," said ISO spokesman Patrick=
=20
Dorinson. "It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards=
,=20
and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as=
=20
best we can."=20
Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an=
d=20
PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up=
=20
following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20
Davis said generators began demanding a "credit penalty" from the water=20
department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20
state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i=
n=20
the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said.=20
Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. "Every time=20
there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged=
=20
alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up," Hart said.=20
But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho=
ur=20
April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below=
=20
what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new=
s=20
service.=20
PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state'=
s=20
increased spending.=20
"This claim is simply not accurate," the utility said in a memo to reporter=
s.=20
Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20
department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde=
r,=20
PG&E said.=20
Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou=
ld=20
further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance=
=20
the power purchases through a bond offering.=20
The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20
purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's=20
bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third=
=20
Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a "ratings=
=20
watch" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20
A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the=20
leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.=
=20
Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20
investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy=
=20
providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving=20
payments again from Edison and PG&E.=20
These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20=20
percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening=20
California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money fr=
om=20
the utilities since November.=20
The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for=
=20
new power deliveries.=20
But the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online.=

SMUD directors vote to hike rates: A tentative increase of 19% to 27% is=20
blamed on rising energy costs.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published April 20, 2001)=20
Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote=
=20
Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave=
=20
tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20
The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled=
=20
for May 3.=20
"This is quite alarming to all of us," said director Peter Keat. But praisi=
ng=20
the value of "a community-owned electric company" that provides everything=
=20
from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice.=20
SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as=20
deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that=
=20
helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings.=20
The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen=
=20
steeply.=20
Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its=
=20
own plants, nearly tripled between October and January.=20
And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's=20
hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20
normal to date.=20
But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20
board to reconsider.=20
"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a=
ll=20
at once," said Marian Ender.=20
Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before=
=20
had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag=
er=20
at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee.=20
The increase "cannot come at a worse time" for Intel, he said, although he=
=20
understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20
electricity available in the future.=20
"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on," Tu=
=20
said.=20
Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20
million annually for SMUD, and a special=20
6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of=
=20
the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent=
=20
years, will go into an emergency fund.=20
"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted," said directo=
r=20
Susan Patterson.=20
The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large=20
industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills=
=20
will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee.=20
The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a "typical" residential=
=20
SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly=
=20
bill hovers around $20.=20
"I just don't think that part is right," Ender said. "We should only pay fo=
r=20
usage."=20
Tom Reavey took the board to task for "unfair and unequitable" rates that=
=20
charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to=20
serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more.=20
But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run=20
farmers' wells and irrigation systems.=20
"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby=20
agriculture," Keat said.=20
The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which include=
s=20
a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip o=
f=20
Sacramento County. They will not=20
affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was=
=20
granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators.=20
"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times=
,=20
it's PG&E customers," said board member Howard Posner.=20
While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first =
of=20
many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will =
be=20
the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years.=20
To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fa=
ll=20
hardest on the heaviest household users.=20
SMUD's old residential rates were=20
divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the=
=20
summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour.=20
The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier =
of=20
14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000=20
kilowatt-hours of electricity.=20
By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission=
=20
that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27=20
cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month.=20
Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industrie=
s=20
will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultura=

Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will p=

Lieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woes

Lieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, warned th=

if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of=

the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects.=20
"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects=

Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator, who has spent thre=

Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas=20



Temporary step will give it time for overall planning
By Jonathan Heller=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 19, 2001=20
ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in=
=20
the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout.=20
The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any=20
proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that=20
period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process th=
at=20
will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants.=20
"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in," City=20
Councilwoman June Rady said.=20


The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January:=20
?Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwe=
st=20
part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning=
=20
Department.=20
?Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant=
=20
on Mission Avenue in west Escondido.=20
?CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on=
=20
Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant.=20
?Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on=
=20
city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet.=
=20
Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the=20
already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can b=
e=20
filed with the city.=20
The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line b=
y=20
the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray=20
Davis.=20
Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. Th=
ey=20
said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisi=
s,=20
which is expected to come to a head this summer.=20
"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer=
,=20
we should not be the ones to stand in the way," Pfeiler said.=20
Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less=
.=20
"The governor is not solving the problem," Waldron said. "It's up to local=
=20
governments to try to do what they can."=20
Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the=20
council's decision would upset his plans.=20
"Our timetable is still not fully defined," Rowley said. "Obviously there's=
 a=20
lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be=
=20
processed."=20
Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned plea=
s=20
for the city to consider alternative power sources.=20
David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to=
=20
think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and=20
rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he=
=20
said.=20
"Escondido has 65 square miles," he said. "But 2,500 acres could be employe=
d=20
to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy."=20
Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated=
=20
from windmills.=20
The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek=20
inexpensive, stable energy rates.=20
The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper=20
rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate=
=20
deals with the city.=20
To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, suc=
h=20
as forming a municipal utility district. San Diego Gas & Electric is the on=
ly=20
energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the=20
regional energy grid.=20
San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any=

The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly=

Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls=20



By Gary Gentile
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
April 19, 2001=20
LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's=20
congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must ac=
t=20
to control the wholesale price of energy.=20
"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates," said Rep. Mary=
=20
Bono, R-Palm Springs. "I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon=
=20
as we can."=20
Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives,=20
including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel ne=
ar=20
Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that=
=20
the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis.=20
The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including=20
military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price o=
f=20
electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California.=20
Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to=
=20
control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the=20
state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan=
=20
solution.=20
"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of=20
electricity," Davis said. "We have agreed to work cooperatively across part=
y=20
lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party=
=20
doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters."=20
"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is=
=20
absurd," said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. "So many of our colleagues=
=20
are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the=20
authority to regulate these two items."=20
The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power=
=20
emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small=
=20
generators.=20
"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, becau=
se=20
we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of=
=20
power, you should be allowed to turn them on," said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-E=
l=20
Cajon.=20
Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts durin=
g=20
a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be=
=20
made.=20
Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without=
=20
violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican=20
officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls=
=20
and favor free markets.=20
Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that=
=20
power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather=
=20
rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power.=20
"We're not talking about artificial caps," Harman said. "We should insist=
=20
that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go tha=
t=20
route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight."=20
The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants prais=
ed=20
the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified=20
approach in Washington.=20
"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's ro=
le=20
seriously," said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. "We clearly understand what ou=

Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers=20



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
April 19, 2001=20
SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from=
=20
becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation=
=20
into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity.=20
With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to=20
determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the=
=20
reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides mu=
ch=20
of the state's energy.=20
These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as "qualifying=20
facilities," or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts o=
wed=20
by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimate=
d=20
$700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled=
=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed=20
maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity=
=20
output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating.=20
The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California=
=20
crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell=20
electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are=20
suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market,=
=20
said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood.=20
All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November,=
=20
said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee,=
=20
which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410=20
million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy=
 said=20
was enough electricity for 3 million homes.=20
"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation)," Raudy said. "We have heard =
so=20
much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime.=
=20
That is what we are worried about."=20
Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity.=20
After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts=
=20
around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin=
=20
paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27.=20
But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The=
=20
QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by=
=20
PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of=
=20
this month.=20
If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into =
an=20
involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said.=20
PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers=
=20
during Thursday's hearing.=20
"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reason=
s,=20
not to game the system," he said.=20
California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer=
=20
when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence.=20
Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power=
=20
capacity, according to the PUC.=20
The QF output will become even more essential this summer because Californi=
a=20
won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as i=
t=20
has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's=20
hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish=
=20
to a record low if the recent drought continues.=20
"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our=

needs," Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity=20
supply.=20
The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California'=

energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state.=
=20
Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday=20

In other moves Thursday, the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the=20

Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue=20

Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.=
S.=20
must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy=20
crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation,=
=20
brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the=20
severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal=20
intervention.=20
?????"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used=20
once," Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of=20
cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.
?????Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once=20
again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been=20
buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dolla=
rs=20
into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since=
=20
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
?????Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strong=
ly=20
opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California=20
Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the=20
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They=20
brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their=20
ideological belief in a free market.
?????"This is not a free-enterprise situation," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpin=
e)=20
said after the meeting. "In fact, it's just the opposite."
?????Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices=20
charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said=20
California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs.=
=20
Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it fin=
ds=20
they are exerting "market power" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.
?????Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators i=
n=20
Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in=20
California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical=20
pipeline into the state.
?????After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman=
=20
(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats=
=20
and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th=
e=20
ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There=
=20
has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n=
o=20
political motive to help the state.
?????"We Democrats," said Sherman, "hope very much that our skepticism is=
=20
proven wrong."
?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and th=
e=20
governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he=
=20
used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by=20
Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch i=
n.=20
Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.
?????Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet wi=
th=20
Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and=20
editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick=
=20
Cheney in which, she said, he "ignored" her appeal for federal assistance.=
=20
?????Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, sayi=
ng=20
they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to ru=
n=20
up prices.
?????The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday befo=
re=20
an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had=20
manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline=
=20
capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.
?????That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to=20
deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipeline=
s=20
and causing a surge in prices.
?????The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas=
=20
soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity=20
increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.
?????"We're not withholding capacity--no one is," said El Paso Merchant=20
Energy President Ralph Eads. "With these prices, you want to sell every=20
molecule."
?????In other developments Thursday:
?????* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its=
=20
ailing utility arm to financial health is in "deep trouble and could be=20
rejected by legislators," the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said i=
n=20
a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the=
=20
deal "would be a humiliating setback for the governor," S&P said.
?????The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's=20
transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion=
=20
in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt.=20
Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to=
=20
the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.
?????Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators=
=20
have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a=20
desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicl=
y=20
that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not=
=20
be such a dire outcome.
?????But a senior Edison executive said it is "way too early" to give up on=
=20
passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official fo=
rm.
?????"There is an education process to do here," the executive said of the=
=20
highly detailed 38-page document. "The legislators should be asking=20
questions. That is appropriate."
?????* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether=20
alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding=
=20
supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla=
rs.
?????The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by=20
lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit=
h=20
the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal=20
energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.
?????"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long,=
=20
hot days of summer," Wood said.
?????Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC=20
needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. "All we have gott=
en=20
is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities," he said.
?????* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious=20
megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by=
=20
state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.
?????Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking=
=20
$242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to=20
distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing=20
conservation programs.
?????But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning=
,=20
said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy=20
protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.
?????Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's=20
decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could=20
follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency=
's=20
efforts.
?????PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the=
=20
Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and=
=20
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if th=
e=20
court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expense=

anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the=

his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolste=

Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to=
=20
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the=20
utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accor=
d=20
could lead to a "long and costly" bankruptcy.=20
But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicl=
e=20
that he thought legislators would "want to do the right thing" by approving=
=20
the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court.=20
Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe=20
consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the=20
state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity=20
rates.=20
Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least=
=20
not in its present form.=20
"We are going to go through this thing extensively," said state Senate=20
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "There are a lot of concern=
s=20
about the valuation."=20
Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long=
=20
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms.=20
"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going t=
o=20
have its say," Burton said.=20
Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain=20
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach=20
common ground with lawmakers.=20
"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"=
=20
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. "There will be a big effort to=
=20
try and work something out."=20
Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his compan=
y=20
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.=
=20
This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned=
=20
acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing.=
=20
Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.=20
"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for=
=20
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that=20
would allow us to get on with operating our power system," Bryson said.=20
Bankruptcy, he said, "is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly=
=20
process."=20
It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating=20
agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in=
=20
warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the=20
state's energy mess.=20
"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds," said Carol Coale, an energy-=
=20
industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "This could lead to =
a=20
surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."=20
Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as =
a=20
prudent alternative to bankruptcy.=20
"This is a very good deal for the state," he said. "It is not a bailout.=20
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."=20
Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8=
=20
billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and=
=20
drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past=
=20
debt.=20
Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission syst=
em=20
-- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little=
=20
use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired.=20
"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison," said Doug Heller,=
 a=20
spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa=20
Monica. "Edison gets off scot-free."=20
Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount pa=
id=20
for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility.=20
They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the stat=
e=20
if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power=20
grid.=20
"The deal on the table is still salvageable," said Michael Shames, executiv=
e=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "But Edison=
=20
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework,=
=20
not set in stone."=20
For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take=
=20
on the issue.=20
"We're just at the initial stage," he said. "We always have accepted the=20
notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the=

State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would=

y=20
and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.=20
Now, much of that is up in the air.=20
Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which=20
consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush =

``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge =

All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest=20

consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30=
=20
percent or more.=20
Among them:=20
?How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved =

three-cent per kilowatt-hour increase last month, which would boost utility=

revenue by $4.8 million. Davis' proposed increase -- left vague in his Apri=
l=20
5 television address -- averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3=
=20
cents for customers of Southern California Edison.=20
?What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates=

only for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the=
=20
additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.=20
?Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from th=

he=20
commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process=
=20
that normally lasts nearly a year.=20
Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential=
=20
customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the=20
average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt=
=20
from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to=
=20
buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline.=
=20
Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates=
=20
for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over=
=20
200 percent of that level.=20
But that's where the similarities end.=20
Differences=20
The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an=20
assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because=
=20
they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,=
=20
commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.=20
The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to=
=20
everyone else?=20
Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E=
=20
users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bill=
s=20
increase 36 percent.=20
Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent=
=20
while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill=20
increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt,=20
would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according =
to=20
a statement on the governor's Web site.=20
Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 3=
0=20
percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.=20
The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from=20
consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential=20
increase of 7.5 percent.=20
TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up=
=20
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.=20
PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residentia=
l=20
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through highe=
r=20
rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average=
=20
rate increase of nearly 30 percent.=20
``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' sa=
id=20
Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.=20
Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for=20
electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.=20
Utilities want surcharge=20
Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.=
=20
Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that=20
everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use.=20
Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of=
=20
time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a=
=20
smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.=20
``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul=20
Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues.=20
All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:=20
California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the=
=20
wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent pe=
r=20
kilowatt-hour -- in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to b=

All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have=20

economic impact of the state's power crisis.=20
The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned=
=20
that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected ta=
x=20
revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's=20
budget.=20
The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on=

state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they buy expensiv=

Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for=20

Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their o=
wn=20
credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the=20
state's very good double-A credit rating.=20
Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to pri=
ce=20
municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer=
=20
bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.=20
The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.=20
Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook fro=

&=20
Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, whe=
n=20
the state began buying electricity for the utilities.=20
The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was t=
he=20
disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will=
=20
be spent.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money=
=20
generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state=20
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the=20
utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be=
=20
any money left for the company.=20
The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threaten=
s=20
to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department=
=20
of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.=20
``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen=
=20
said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.''=20
A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as=20
expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were belo=
w=20
forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those=20
months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected.=20
Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power cost=
s=20
now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California=20
analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite=20
concern.=20
``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these=
=20
projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the=
=20
current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some=
=20
of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and=20
investors last week in a conference call.=20
Other economy-watchers expressed concern.=20
Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said=
=20
the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon.=20

End To Deregulation of Nevada Power



CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill
Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt
deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate
system.


The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier
in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to
keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to
California's.


``I must tell you this is a great relief,'' said Guinn, a former
utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can
control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect
ourselves.''


Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that
ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit
from sales of excess power to other states.


Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy
issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow.
That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as
casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market.


Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy
conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills.

PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -

FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and


Electric Company


There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect
Pacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had on
energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful
facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be
driving the state's energy costs higher.


Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying
roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result
of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, even
laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides
of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor
should know better.


Consider the facts:


--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest


investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to


below investment grade by every major rating agency.


Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to


sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.


--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state


Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power


purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the


Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an


ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could


be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in


the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the


full "net open position", which is the amount of additional


generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or


have under contract, to meet customer demand.


However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of


state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full


net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was


only buying power that it considered "reasonably priced" and


was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the


lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to


20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.


--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass


along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market


purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite


existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).


PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly


$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know


for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say


how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will


the ISO.)


--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission


informed the Independent System Operator that it could not


force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,


both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to


purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the


next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying


the order was limited to "emergency" power only. The ISO also


sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining


order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to


continue selling to it.


--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with


FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the


February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.


--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge


Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,


Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell


electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.


Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they


sought such assurances.


--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11


filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the


"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy


procurement costs" caused by the state's failure to assume the


full procurement responsibility.


--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued


an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint


against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its


February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf


of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.


--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's


office acknowledged the State's "bill for energy purchases


will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling


last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission," once


DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than


force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely


that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the


utilities' costs, not the combination of both.


--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of


publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.


--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid


buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to


the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO


sent a "murky" notice to generators promising that "any bid


accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial


support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this


notice." Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the


assurances contained in the letter.


--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy


was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for


the Western Power Trading Forum, said "I don't believe, nor


have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to


the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and


marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings


order to an otherwise volatile situation."


What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costs
have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energy
needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits has
come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders
that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were
issued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to
PG&amp;E and SCE.


Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,
when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and
the DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect of
the FERC order since mid-February.


Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a
credit penalty since December, when the utilities' deteriorating
financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be
far more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementation
has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E's
Chapter 11 filing.

J.D. Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20
Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses




Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation;


Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet


AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers,
who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation's
electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according=
 to
the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom=
er
Satisfaction Study(SM) released today.  Consequently, the study's nationwid=
e
customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001.


(Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-a


http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-b

http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-e )


"The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter,
and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers
are especially sensitive to electricity prices," said Jeffrey Conklin, seni=
or
director at J.D. Power and Associates.


The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with
California's "big three" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr=
ic,
San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an
astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the
2000 study.


"In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business
customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific," said Alan Destribats,
executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates.


The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric
utility midsize customers are a provider's company image, price and value, =
and
power quality and reliability.


As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of
performance in the areas of company image and price and value.  Even outsid=
e
of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than
any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001.


Power Quality and Reliability


Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with
the national index increasing by 3 points.  Although the number of
interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it
was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli=
ng
from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour=
s
in 2001.


Retail Competition


"Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult
process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo=
r
marks," said Destribats.


The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with
competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states,
but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year.  The stu=
dy
also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers=
.
Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do=
ne
so, up from 5 percent in 2000.


J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than
7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and
consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses
throughout the United States.  Midsize business owners are defined as those
who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity.  The study
shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon=
th
on electricity.


The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States
consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer
satisfaction.  Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the
lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average.  Midsize
businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per
month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the
most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average).  The study also shows that
midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service
interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto=
n
report the fewest.


East Region


PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall

Turbines in Place for 70,000-megawatt Program


SAN JOSE, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ --
Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN), the nation's fastest growing independent
power producer, announced today it will purchase 35 model 7FB and 11 model =
7FA
gas-fired turbines from GE Power Systems. With this announcement, Calpine h=
as
firm orders in place for the delivery of 203 turbines. When operated in a
combined-cycle application, this represents 50,000 megawatts of baseload
capacity.


The agreement marks the company's second large volume turbine acquisition
from GE and is an important component of Calpine's five-year strategic plan=
 to
have 70,000 megawatts of generation on line by the end of 2005. Calpine wil=
l
take delivery of 5 turbines in 2002, with the remainder of the contract to =
be
filled by the end of 2005.


"This purchase significantly strengthens Calpine's leadership position in
project development," said Doug Kieta, senior vice president-construction f=

Calpine's first-mover advantage as we expand our development program and en=
ter
new electricity markets across the country."


"GE Power Systems is pleased to provide Calpine today's technology of
choice for power generation," said Delbert Williamson, President of GE Powe=

Systems Global Sales. "Our FA technology is the most proven advanced
technology available, and we're confident our evolutionary FB technology wh=
ich
has been designed using GE's Corporate-wide Six Sigma initiative will provi=
de
Calpine highly competitive power generation."


GE's current fleet of F technology gas turbines recently surpassed
3.8 million hours of operation around the globe. GE's 7FB turbine is an
evolution of the current 7FA model and is designed for higher efficiency,
lower life-cycle cost power generation. By employing this new technology,
Calpine will continue to generate electricity competitively while consuming
less natural gas and producing fewer emissions than a typical power plant o=
f
comparable size.
