Week of Jan. 4 - 7th

No Issues with Y2K @ any Enron Office Facilities
Gary Fitch to Europe to negotiate with Litton (fixed base operator that will 
crew and maintain our London based Hawker)
Working on setting up Azurix to be partial owner/lessee of all seven aircraft 
in our fleet.  Considering charging Azurix cost of 3rd party legal expenses 
related to transactions.
Had 29 laptop computers stolen from EB and 3AC in 1999.  Working with IT 
groups on tracking techniques however everything discussed appears too 
intrusive.
Added $600K of spend to our minority sourcing efforts (all Houston copy paper 
now purchased and delivered through minority firm - Lee Office Supply)
ECI has moved into EB level 44 this weekend.  All looks good.
Terry Thorn will consolidate his staff onto level 21 of 3AC (former EI 
executive floor).  Minor renovation is planned to improve density.  Kurt 
Huneke's group is anxious for Terry's group to get off of 3AC level 15 so he 
can expand.
We had our highest volume of meals ever served in the Energizer last Tuesday 
(1st day back of new year)
EES is asking that we move Accounts Payable out of the Enron Building (on EB 
level 12) so they can take over space.  EES would also like Accounts Payable 
to move to 600 Jefferson to help mitigate their lease obligations.  I've 
placed call into Rick Causey to get his thoughts.  Have not heard back.
ECI is interested in setting up a NOC (network operations center) @ Ardmore 
Facility.  They'll need 1/2 of the available space.  Working with Corp. IT to 
determine feasibility and facility cost sharing.
Meeting this week with Drayton McClane and Astros management to finalise 
business points regarding construction of a Garage at Enron Field.
