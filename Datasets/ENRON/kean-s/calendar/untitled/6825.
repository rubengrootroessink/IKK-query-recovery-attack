COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

Clean Air - EPA Mercury Determination:   On Thursday, 12/14, EPA issued its=
=20
mercury determination, deciding there is a need to regulate mercury emissio=
ns=20
from power plants and laying out a timetable for developing the necessary=
=20
regulations.  EPA indicated that it would consider "flexible" measures for=
=20
complying with regulations, including trading, but no further details were=
=20
included in the determination.  Jeff Keeler provided information on this=20
regulation to Enron Americas power trading and origination, EGM=20
coal/emissions traders, EES and other corporate groups.

Clean Air - Section 126 Rule Litigation:   Federal District court in D.C.=

which grants relief to northeast states who petitioned for greater control =

scheduled to go into effect for sources in May 2003 -- 1 year sooner than=

similar state-developed regulations will go into effect for the same source=
s=20
under the NOx SIP Call.  The outcome of the litigation is important because=
 a=20
ruling for industry could give sources another year to plan for emissions=
=20
controls.  Jeff Keeler will issue a report on the litigation to Enron=20
Americas, EGM, EIM, EES, and other impacted corporate groups.

Power Quality/Distributed Generation:  Stacey Bolton and Mary Schoen=20
continued to provide assistance to EES' Premium Power group as they look at=
=20
environmental drivers for their business model.  Stacey delivered detailed=

information on federal incentive programs for distributed generation and Ma=

states.

EPA Green Power RFI:   Stacey Bolton provided information to EES (Richard=
=20
Ring) in response to an RFI for the supply of green power to EPA in Ohio. =
=20
(Part of the information that will be included in the RFI response will be=
=20
the Enron EHS annual report).   Stacey also talked with APX about their=20
exchange in Ohio and the potential for EES to price out a deal for green=20
credits to use in the potential deal w/ EPA.  APX is very interested in doi=
ng=20
a deal w/ EES, and has landfill credits for EES to bid on.  Stacey provided=
=20
this information to EES.

Renewable Energy Credits:  Stacey organized a conference call w/EGM and EES=

supply desk to discuss potential partnerships with Clean Power Markets (Gre=

ADVOCACY/COMMERCIAL SUPPORT

Clean Air - NOx SIP Call:  Mary Schoen continued work on development of Sta=
te=20
Implementation Plans (SIPs) in several key Enron States, including Illinois=
,=20
Tennessee, and Indiana.   States had until October 31, 2000 to submit SIPs =
to=20
EPA for approval or face preemption by federal NOx rules, but EPA informall=
y=20
extended that deadline until the end of the year.  Mary is submitting=20
comments to these states as they prepare their final SIPs.
Tennessee:  will be less of a priority with the sale of the Brownsville=20

Indiana:  Mary is working with EES to ensure allocation of allowances to=20
"energy efficiency" projects, which could prove to have value for EES and=
=20
customers.

Environmental Disclosure/Labeling:   as EES will be entering Ohio on 1/1/01=
=20
in First Energy's territory, Stacey Bolton met with the EES reporting team=
=20
concerned about the label.   Stacey suggested that since First Energy is=20
doing the billing function for EES' customers, EES lay off the disclosure=
=20
requirement on First Energy (First Energy will also be purchasing and=20
delivering the power).  EES is attempting to implement this suggestion.   E=
ES=20
is also actively looking at CG&E territory and needs to prepare a disclosur=

Pipeline Safety Legislation:    In Congress' last minute efforts to pass=20
appropriations bills, rumors have circulated that there may be an attempt t=

attach pipeline safety legislation.   Jeff Keeler worked to gather more=20
information on these efforts, and found that support of many key=20
congressional leaders for such an effort is missing.  Jeff forwarded to ETS=

and others a letter sent by Senator John McCain (a key pipeline safety=20
proponent) to congressional leaders) urging that pipeline legislation not b=
