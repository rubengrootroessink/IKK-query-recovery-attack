SK - I've printed this out & put in the folder w/ the others.  mm

Happy New Year to you and your family, Steve!  I hope you got something of a 
break despite all the brushfires.

Please find attached the 2000 achievements that you asked for.  The only 
thing I didn't put down is that I had a whole lot of fun doing all these 
things!

Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best wishes.

Jackie
