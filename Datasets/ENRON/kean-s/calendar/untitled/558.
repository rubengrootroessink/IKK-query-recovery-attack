Steve:  here is the first set of comments from one of our lawyers.  If you 
would like me to bring him to the Hill to discuss any of the items or arrange 
a phone call, just let me know.  In the meantime, I will continue to gather 
more comments and gather them together in one document with suggested 
specific edits.  However, given your short turn around, I thought it helpful 
to forward what I received ASAP.
