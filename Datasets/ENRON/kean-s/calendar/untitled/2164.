You recently received and invitation from Cindy Derecskey to attend a 
presentation on "Best Practices in Communication" by Global Corporations, 
scheduled for DEC 18 from 3 to 5pm. Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share 
some background on how this came about and why it may be relevant to your 
area of responsibility. 
During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop a better 
appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, 
tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and 
more strategic role communication is being asked to play.  As such, several 
companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously 
completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, 
i.e.  BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., 
McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. 
The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and 
you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and 
findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will 
forward the final report to your attention.
The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1. Please feel free to 
invite any others you feel might benefit from this material.  
Thank you in advance for anticipated cooperation. Do not hesitate to call, if 
you have any questions.
