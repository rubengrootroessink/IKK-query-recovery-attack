my 2001 budget proposal, as cleaned up by accounting.  As it does contain 
salary info, I have not copied Elizabeth.  I have no problem with her seeing 
it, but did not know what your preference was.  If you want salary data 
eliminated, I believe a single aggregate figure can be shown.  Will be 
sending you separately the allocations across business units.  let me know if 
you have questions or want to discuss.   mcs

Mark,

I have not forwarded onto your reports in Houston as I thought you may want 
to review first and I was not sure if you wanted all the salary information 
sent.  We can discuss Monday morning if you wish.

These are print screens from adaytum, and I have included a summary 
reconciling from your workpaper to my Adaytum figures.
5 pages in total. 


I have entered the Allocations percentages you gave me as well, so we have 
completed everything we need for the budget.



Thanks
Greg
