		Democrats Mistook Static for  Votes 
		Robert Blohm - Princeton, New Jersey 
		
		Last Saturday's Miami-Dade court-recount, under a strict standard,  
reportedly favored George W. Bush. In other words the higher quality the  
vote, the relative greater likelihood it was for Mr. Bush. This accords  with 
testimony a week earlier before Judge Sauls by Gore's Quebec  statistician, 
Nicholas Hengartner. He depicted that "new" votes  "recovered" in the Broward 
County manual recount of rejected ballots were,  even under that county's 
less strict standard, biased toward Mr. Bush  relative to the votes before 
the manual recount: Mr. Bush had 34% of the  new (i.e. "recovered") votes, 
versus 31% of the votes before the manual  recount. 
		
		The three Florida Supreme Court wise men last Friday  fixed on two tradeoffs: 
speed vs. accuracy, and (higher) margin of error  vs. (lower) margin of 
victory. When it's hopeless to pin down an exact  number, the trend becomes 
everything. And the trend, the stricter the  standard, has been toward Mr. 
Bush. 
		
		You had to include overvotes  in any statewide recount, which includes 
optical ballots as well as  punch-card ballots. While punch ballots have a 
higher undervote rate than  optical ballots, it's the reverse with overvotes. 
Why? If you only touch  both candidates' spots with the stylus (leaving no 
mark) or a pencil  (leaving a mark), what registers as an undervote on a 
punch ballot  registers as an overvote on an optical ballot. 
		
		Undervotes can be  non-votes, or low-quality votes which may vary in quality 
with the voter's  mental ability. There is a level of mental ability below 
which voting  behavior is noise, unintelligible, unpurposeful. The issue was 
where you  set the cut-off point, and ignore incompetence. 
		
		The Democratic  Party has a practice of assigning no cut-off point, as if 
rounding up  derelicts to cast meaningless votes. It's as if Mr. Gore was 
trying to get  elected by assigning purposefulness to incompetents, in the 
face of  evidence that competence was biasing votes toward Mr. Bush.
