Subject: Ken Lay meetings

Rosalee, I attach a draft list of meetings for Mr Lay for the 31October and 1 
November. The purpose of sending you the list now is to give you a general 
idea as to the type of meetings we are considering. I also attach a brief 
background note on each meeting.



I will be sending you a full briefing pack for Mr Lay prior to the visit. In 
the interim please let me know if you have any questions in relation to the 
attached.



A couple of housekeeping questions:
I understand that Mr Lay has an allergy to shell fish. Is that restricted to 
eating or does it extend to smell - ie do we need to eliminate shellfish from 
the buffet. In addition, we propose including sushi in the buffet. Same 
question - would this pose a problem for Mr Lay?
What standard of hotel accommodation would be appropriate for Mr Lay. We have 
reserved a range of rooms for Enron people at the Hotel Okura (part of the 
Leading Hotels of the World group), venue for the office opening and press 
conference. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

kind regards
