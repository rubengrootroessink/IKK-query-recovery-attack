PROPOSED ACTION STEPS AGREED TO AT DENVER EMERGENCY MEETING ON DECEMBER 20, 
2000 

1. Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its 
efforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric 
power market. 

2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of 
assistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the
implications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral 
contracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so 
high; who
has benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has 
been held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual 
governors
views on these matters. 

3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western 
gubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated, 
state-by-state,
voluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting 
no later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale 
to reduce
or reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service 
commissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users 
for
forgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree 
and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the
electricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will 
coordinate an energy conservation response by December 28. 

4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague 
President-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western 
governors on
this urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made. 

5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early 
February a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action 
plan for
the west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy, 
including increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy 
throughout the region
today and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter 
2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy
crisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a 
hemispheric energy policy.
