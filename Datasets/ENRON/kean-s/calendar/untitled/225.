  Bob Fisher

Welcome to the Enron WTO Working Group.  We hold our first meeting in Houston 
the evening of Thursday, January 13 at dinner (7:00 PM; restaurant, t/b/a) 
during which Bob Fisher of (Carla) Hills and Company and I will brief 
attendees on current developments and strategy of the Energy Services 
Coalition.

The official Enron WTO Working Group meeting will convene in the Enron 
Building, Conference Room 49C1 on Friday, January 14, 2000 at 8:00 AM-Noon.  
Your input on the attached questionnaire* will be used by the Energy Services 
Coalition (ESC) to draft a position paper for official use.  This 
questionnaire, drafted by Bob Fisher, has already been distributed to members 
of the Energy Services Coalition (ESC) and to many of you.

We also need your input on businesses and associations known to you whom you 
might contact.  We would like you to enlist their support for our goals with 
either our government or others who are able to influence the WTO services 
negotiation.  

We plan to use the Enron Conference Call System on Friday to facilitate the 
participation of those unable to be in Houston for the January 14, 2000 
meeting.  The meeting will adjourn before noon.

Kindly advise Lora Sullivan by e-mail (lsulliv@enron.com) if you plan to be 
with us for the Thursday dinner (7:00 PM) and the Friday session (8:00 AM - 
Noon).

Best wishes for a pleasant holiday.

Joe Hillings

Encl.

*Please complete the questionnaire and forward to Joe Hillings prior to 
January 14, 2000.
