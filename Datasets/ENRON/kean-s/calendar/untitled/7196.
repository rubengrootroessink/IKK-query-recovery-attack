Rick - In case you didn't receive this, here is the e-mail that Cynthia sent 
yesterday about next week's Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
hearing.  It will be held on Wednesday, January 31 at 9:30 a.m. in 216 Hart 
Senate Office Building and will most likely continue for a second day, to be 
determined.  Let us know if you need anything else.  Thanks.

Steve:  I ran into Senate Energy Committee Chief of Staff Andrew Lundquist 
who advised me that Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) sent a letter directly to Ken 
Lay asking him or his designee (you?)( Jeff Skilling?)  to testify at the 
January 31st Senate Energy Committee hearing on the California situation.  As 
reported earlier, Secretary Abraham and FERC Chairman Hebert will be 
testifying at the beginning of the hearing.  Enron would be asked to join a 
panel of eight which includes invited witnesses of:  SoCalEd, PG&E, SMUD, 
LAWDP, Calpine, Williams and Reliant.  Should Enron accept, EPSA would have 
four witnesses on this panel of eight.

When I spoke to Andrew, he said the Committee was more interested in hearing 
Enron's testimony on markets, long term contracts, risk management, etc.  
than the generation and new power plant construction viewpoints likely to be 
offered by the other EPSA witnesses.  He believes this will complement what 
the Administration witnesses will say.  Believe it or not, recently, Chairman 
Murkowski has made some progress in moving towards supporting Enron's open 
access electricity  transmission position, although his draft legislation is 
silent on this issue.  Our testimony on the importance of open access for 
reliability purposes ("reliability" would be the tie-in to discuss this issue 
in relation to the draft legislation) plus on the need for consistency with 
the other existing open access provisions in the Murkowski draft bill  could 
provide an excellent platform for Enron to inform many Congressional members 
about California, markets and deregulation needs (the Murkowski draft bill 
was sent to you earlier and is to be introduced February 5th or 6th.)  

Steve, earlier you had asked for the opportunity to do a Hill staff briefing 
on California to reach a larger audience with our messages.  I believe this 
would provide an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal.  If you would 
like, either at a breakfast prior to or in the afternoon after, we could also 
do a Press Club briefing and/or arrange to have a room on the Hill (perhaps 
on the House side) to invite staffers for additional briefings (and include 
the other EPSA witnesses.)

In the alternative, if this hearing date does not work in your schedule,  the 
other EPSA witnesses could make some of our points for us.  However, these 
points might be somewhat diluted given these witnesses' other priorities.  As 
always, you (Jeff and Ken) make a fabulous witness.

Please advise.  (This hearing will be covered extensively by the Press.)
