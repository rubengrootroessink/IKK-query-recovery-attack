Ricardo:

Please call me ASAP to discuss this meeting.  I am very concerned that our 
regulatory strategy is getting separated from our commercial objectives.  For 
a meeting of this type, I think it would be far more beneficial for Ken to 
talk about specific commercial objectives than just having a general 
discussion (which, as you know, wouldn't be what Martens would be seeking).  
What is the agenda?  Is there a briefing book for Ken?  If so, what does it 
say about our projects and project initiatives?

Max

Max, Jaime,
I have been coordinating a possible visit of Secretary Martens to Ken Lay in 
Houston.  The initial agreement was that the Secretary would meet with Mr. 
lay on Mionday Feb. 12 at 9:00 a.m.   Nevertheless since Martens has to see 
President Fox on the 12th, he is requesting to see Mr. Lay on Sunday Feb. 
11th in the afternoon.

Secretary Marten's is interested in having this meeting before Feb. 16th 
which is when Presidents Bush and Fox are meeting in Guanajuato.  

President Fox has been making statements with respect to having a common 
energy policy with North America and about electricity and gas infrastructure 
interconnections ( Max, he almost said from The Yukon to Yucatan) and Martens 
wants to listen to Mr. Lay's opinion and build some good will there.

I will let you know if the meeting is confirmed and when it will take place.

Best,

Ricardo
