American Foreign Service Association President Marshall Adair called to 
advise that of the 10 foreign service officers now in economic training at 
the Foreign Service Institute, 7 of the 10 had indicated an interest in join 
ing Enron's Federal Affairs office for the newly instituted Business 
Practicum. Marshall asked that I call Tom Martin, deputy director of the 
Office of the Business Coordinator which I did.

I agreed that we would take two of the foreign service officers.   Tom 
Pierce's last post was in Amman, Jordan where he headed the commercial 
section at the embassy as senior economic officer. Following the Business 
Practicum, he will be joining the Office of the Business Coordinator which is 
an excellent fit for us. He had prior assignments in Melbourne and Ecuador 
where he did counsellor work. He worked at Case-Harvester in sales and 
marketing and has an MBA.

Rob Winchester will be going to one of the "stans" after the Business 
Practicum. His earlier foreign service assignments include regional economic 
office in Washington with the East Asia Bureau, DOS Operations Center, 
Malayasia and Romania counsellor assignments.

I've agreed to accepting both and will be assigning one to each of you. 
Carolyn will need to get them an office in the expansion space at Rome.

P.S. I think we should organize some briefing materials and take them to 
lunch so they can be oriented before arrival.
