Background
At the Napa meeting in December, one of the Working Groups established was=
=20
for Knowledge and Information Management.  The group=01,s mission is to dev=
elop=20
a system for capturing and distributing knowledge and information.  The pil=
ot=20
version of the group=01,s efforts is tentatively scheduled to be launched i=
n=20
September 2000.

Overview
The product is a web based application to store knowledge and information,=
=20
initially for Public Affairs as a pilot program, then as a system for all o=
f=20
Enron.  The system will be populated and maintained by users.  The goal is =
be=20
able to find specific data with as few =01&clicks=018 as possible, so data =
will be=20
searchable and linkable between documents and topics.  Each document will b=
e=20
summarized, and will be =01&sanitized=018 to prevent confidential data from=
 being=20
distributed from the system.  Input to the system will be subject to a revi=
ew=20
process.  Documents in the system will include white-papers, presentations,=
=20
process histories and/or summaries, articles, links to external sites, and=
=20
any other information identified as =01&knowledge=018 through this survey a=
nd as=20
the system evolves that would be valuable to others in the company.  (See=
=20
attached diagram.)

Request
For the initial population of the system, we request your assistance in=20
developing a directory of Public Affairs experts who have specific knowledg=
e=20
and can best communicate it.  To do so, we ask for your input through the=
=20
attached survey.  We will contact the identified experts directly to solici=
t=20
their submissions to the system.  Your participation and recommendations ar=
e=20
essential in making this system a shared success.  Thank you in advance for=
=20
your support!



Please return your response to Elizabeth Linnell and Ricardo Charvel.  We'r=
e=20
looking for as many responses as possible before July 5 so that we can revi=
ew=20
them during our next working group meeting.  Any and all responses will be=
=20
appreciated!
