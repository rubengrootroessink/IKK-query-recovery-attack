Rumors about Jim and Diomedes departure are widespread and they have asked=
=20
that we distribute the following message to South America employees as soon=
=20
as possible:

Memo to Enron South America:

We have decided to leave Enron to pursue other interests.  It has been a=20
pleasure and honor to have worked with all of you over the past few years. =
=20
We can be reached through the following numbers:

Jim Bannantine

email at bannant@attglobal.net=20
phone at 55-11-247-4449
fax at 55-11-5548-5528

Diomedes Christodoulou

email at dchristo2@attglobal.net.=20
phone at 44-207-823-9870
fax at  44-207-823-9871,  cel 713-539-6731

I have discussed with Steve Kean and we are comfortable with sending out th=
is=20
internal message, if you concur.  In addition, we expect that there will be=
=20
local (South America) inquiries and perhaps international media inquiries=
=20
about the resignations.   We plan to use the following statements for these=
=20
audiences respectively. =20

South America
I can confirm that Jim Bannantine and Diomedes Christodoulou have resigned=
=20
from Enron to pursue other interests.  We wish them well in their new=20
endeavors.  Both had begun the transfer over to other Enron's businesses=20
several months ago, so the transition at Enron South America is already=20
underway.  We have a strong management team in place and every confidence i=
n=20
their continuing ability to manage the business effectively.

International Media
I can confirm that =01(XXX=01(. resigned from Enron to pursue other interes=
ts. We=20
wish him/them well in his/their new endeavors.  Over the past year Enron ha=
s=20
decreased its emphasis on international infrastructure development, as the=
=20
company continues to re-deploy its capital into newer, higher growth=20
opportunities.  The transition to this new organizational structure already=
=20
has been underway for several months.  In fact, we have a strong management=
=20
team in place and every confidence in their ability to manage the business=
=20
effectively.

Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns with this approach.=
 =20
I will call to confirm that this is acceptable to you.

John
