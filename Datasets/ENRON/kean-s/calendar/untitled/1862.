Mark and Steve,

I'm forwarding this "FYI".......Chris's work looks great!  I'll coordinate 
the filming they're interested in.  I may suggest they use Beth Steir, as our 
people know her and she knows our system--I'll discuss this with Chris.

With further regard to Harvard, I'm working with two other big initiatives 
with various faculty there, and trying to coordinate "Harvard with 
Harvard"---that is, trying to keep all Harvard's faculty pursuing Enron 
projects, in each other's respective "loops"..I've also been trying to keep 
Pankaj Ghemawat in these loops out of respect to his position on Enron's 
Advisory Committee.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Dear Christie:

First I wanted to thank you belatedly for the excellent organization you
provided in setting up our meetings in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  The
information we got was right on target and Meg and I came back with full
notebooks and bulging heads.  It was a very useful and productive trip from
our point of view, and we very much appreciated your very professional
organization of the process.

Having worked on the drafts over the last couple of weeks, we have come to
the conclusion that the material is just too rich to fit into a single
case.  In dividing our story into two parts, we focused our first case on
the transformational story that unfolded during the 1990s, not only on the
strategic changes occurring within the company but also on the
organizational and managerial redesign that supported and drove those new
directions.  The second case will encapsulate some of that company
background, but will focus in more detail on the way in which the new Enron
environment sparked the Enron Online innovation.  I have used this approach
a couple of times previously, focusing on entrepreneurship at 3M and on
human resource management at Microsoft, and for your information I will
forward copies of those two-part cases as models of what we are working
towards.

The other thing I wanted to update you on was our plans to make these cases
as interactive as possible.  Given Enron's transition into the "new
economy" and particularly the focus of the Enron Online case, we feel it is
very important to develop these cases in a multimedia manner. This means
that we will try to provide links to video material, Websites, streamed
interviews, etc. wherever they can support the development of the story
line.  The videos you sent us following our last visit are a very good
starting point, but we should probably try to schedule videotaped
interviews with Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, and Louise Packard for sometime in
the near future -- certainly before Christmas.

Thanks again for all your help and support in getting us this far.  Our
hope is that we can get some drafts to you over the next couple of weeks
for your review and input.  Meanwhile, Meg will be contacting you to see if
we can set up a day for the videotaped interviews.  We are greatly looking
forward to completing our work on this very exciting project.

Yours sincerely,
Chris Bartlett
