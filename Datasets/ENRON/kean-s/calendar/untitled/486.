Thought you'd get a kick out of this (especially after our recent "hold 
music" activity!)




Try this.   It's for real.   The following is the customer
service number for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.

              1-800-578-7453

Dial the number and listen to their greeting message,
until the point when you are requested to choose an
extension, and then you can hang up.
The greeting message is priceless though, and worth the
time it takes to make the toll-free call.
