Bill/Steve,  I feel comfortable with allocating a total of 350 hrs. for 
personal usage in yr2001 to the business units. 

In 2000 we operated 5 1/2  aircraft  a total of 4,375hrs.  Net the chairman's 
office we did 354hrs of personal usage (Lay 280hrs)  

We will not experience the down time in 2001 like we did in 2000 for major 
scheduled inspections so consequently additional hours could be flown above 
the norm without additional manpower more than we had in 2000.  I estimate we 
could still operate at last years total hours due to the fact we still have 
more than our budgeted 5 aircraft.  Once we have disposed of the surplus 
aircraft we may need to adjust the available personal use hours down slightly 
due to availability around business needs.  As long as the personal aircraft 
users are flexible with their time and dates I don't see a problem.
