Attached is the latest version.    Note the average price of power
assumed purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent
for the 9.5 years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's
forward price curves are used.  We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in
our sensitivity page.   The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and
DWR curves.   Enron's curves are significantly lower on the back-end.
The other switch is for the allocation of the past utility purchases: 1)
one pro rata, and 2)  one where the non-core shares prorata, plus half
the core's portion.  DWR past purchases are handled pro rata in both
scenarios.


Regards,


Michael
