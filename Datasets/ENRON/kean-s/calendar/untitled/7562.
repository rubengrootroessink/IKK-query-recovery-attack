Rick,

Ken Lay is going to be the Co-Chair of the Mexico Meeting of the World 
Economic Forum to be held in Cancun on Feb. 26 and 27.  Rob Bradley asked me 
to prepare information and some talking points.  I drafted a presentation 
which apparently Ken Lay liked when we met with him on Feb. 9th.  Rob worked 
on making the wording better and came up with a final version of the talking 
points.

Rob handed me the responsibility of assisting Ken Lay at Cancun and Rosalee 
suggested that I be there personally.  I will be flying out on Sunday at noon 
and returning to Mexico on Tuesday late at night.

I am attaching the agenda for the event, the power point presentation and the 
talking points in word.

Rick, I could not thank you properly for your support since at the time of 
your call I was not alone.  Kikumi and I are very grateful for your support 
and kindness.

Thank you again,

Ricardo
