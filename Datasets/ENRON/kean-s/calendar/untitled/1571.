ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Legislation

Pipeline Safety - The Senate Pipeline Safety Bill (McCain bill, S. 2438) wa=
s=20
defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday 10/10.   The bill was=
=20
brought up under "suspension of the rules" in order to avoid possible=20
amendments, a procedure which required a two-thirds vote for passage.  The=
=20
bill fell short by 28 votes, with 232 voting for, and 158 against.   Althou=
gh=20
the McCain legislation imposed a number of new requirements on pipelines, t=
he=20
pipeline industry supported S. 2438 as the best achievable legislation, giv=
en=20
recent accidents and the possible political climate next year.  The=20
legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats, on mor=
e=20
political than substantive grounds.   With only a few days remaining in the=
=20
congressional session, the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta=
ch=20
some form of legislation to a fast-moving appropriations bill.   Industry c=
an=20
not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill -=
-=20
anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation=
=20
stronger would likely be "deal breakers" for industry.  Jeff Keeler will=20
remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved.

MTBE - Senate MTBE legislation (S. 2962) which passed the Environment=20
Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a stand-alone basis,=
=20
but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill=
=20
(such as a simple MTBE ban) will take place in the various appropriations=
=20
efforts.  While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders=
=20
that an anti-MTBE measure will not be included, the powerful ethanol forces=
=20
are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year.  We have=20
avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VA-HUD (EPA) appropriations bills so f=
ar=20
-- which were the most likely targets for inclusion.   We are prepared to=
=20
counter any last minute anti-MTBE amendments with amendments providing=20
transition funding for MTBE producers, which a number of Senators, includin=
g=20
ethanol proponents like Tom Daschle, have indicated they would not oppose. =
 =20
It is most likely that action on this legislation will take place in the ne=
xt=20
Congress.
