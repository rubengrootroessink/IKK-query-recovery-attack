As you all know, third-party access in gas and power in Germany is on a 
negotiated basis.  You do not need to read below, but the highlight is that 
the trade association, VIK, representing industrial users of energy, has 
walked away from the negotiations of a third-party access regime in the gas 
industry in Germany.  This is a real political blow for the German Economics 
Ministry, which has been very resistant to regulated third-party access, in 
the belief that negotiations were the way to proceed.  Just a brief update 
for all of you.   mcs

Subject: After yesterdays failure to make any progress: VIK steps out of 
Gas-VVII negotiations on improved grid access conditions

Yesterday was the last "negotiation" round before the scheduled meeting with 
the minister of economics on Monday
Again no suprises yesterday: The gas incumbents did not move an inch on the 
three current issues:
-access to storage
-management of capacity constraints
-transparency

Somewhat as a suprise came the attached letter plus press statement today 
from VIK stating that they are not willing to spend any more time without a 
significant change on the gas side. This decision was supposingly driven by 
board members of VIK today.

From our prospective it is good news that VIK (finally) takes a stand to get 
some REAL improvement in the access conditions.
Details psl see attached (german) press statement:



Happy to answer any questions

Carsten
