I strongly suspect that she'll be too modest to ever mention this to you, but 
you should know that two nights ago Linda was invited over to Treasury where 
Secretary Summers presented her with the "Alexander Hamilton" award.   I 
don't know too many details about the award, other than apparently it is the 
highest honor in the Treasury Department, and until Linda was awarded it, it 
had only been given to Secretaries (and UnderSecretaries?).
