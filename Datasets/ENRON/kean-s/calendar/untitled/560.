Subject: FERC Presentation

Attached is my first attempt at what we should discuss at the FERC meeting on 
Monday.  I'll be working on it over the weekend so any suggestions are 
appreciated.  Please e-mail your suggestions or comments to my HOME e-mail at 
shak@ev1.net.   Make sure to read this and let me know if anything I have 
suggested is too controversial or conflicts too much with the corporate 
message--you will not hurt my feelings at all.  Thanks for the input!
