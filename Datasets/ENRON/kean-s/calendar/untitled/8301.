Rick and Steve:

Per Rick's request, attached is the memorandum prepared by V&E last summer 
regarding possible emergency action DOE could take on open access issues.   

As Rick and I discussed this morning, we are trying to assess what authority 
DOE has, and what authority it would need, to enable it to take emergency 
action this summer if things start to go badly.  I will be working with Linda 
and John Shelk here in Washington on this issue.  We will let you know what 
we come up with.

Sarah
