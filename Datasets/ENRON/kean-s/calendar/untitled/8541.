Ron, 

HEre's what we see in the DataMart as the largest headcount changes for EES 
2000.  Please confirm and validate or provide valid business reasons. thanks.

2000 Net Growth    EES (third column-disregard first two)

COMMERCIAL	ACCT MNGT.	0	0	49
COMMERCIAL	RISK MNGT. - RETAIL	0	0	42
COMM. SUPPORT	ACCOUNTING	15	5	54
COMM. SUPPORT	ADMIN. ASST./CLER.	31	36	146
COMM. SUPPORT	DIRECT SALES SUPPORT	-2	24	86
COMM. SUPPORT	TRANSACTION SUPPORT	4	7	80


TECHNICAL	ENGINEERING	0	1	140
TECHNICAL	OPERATIONS	-1	0	169
TECHNICAL	TECH OPERATIONS SUPPORT	-1	70	118



The technical areas appear to be from NEPCO - does that sound right for 2000? 
For the commercial and support areas - is this growth from the increased deal 
flow.
Do you know why the admin level increased so much?

2001 Net Growth    EES (third column-disregard first two) - no significant 
changes.
