I hoped to catch you for a minute or two today to thank you for inviting me 
to consider the rotation opportunity in your group. I am very interested in 
the rotation but don't feel I can pursue it in March since I had formally 
accepted a position with EBS Structuring in mid-January. As I mentioned to 
Rob, I would very much like to revisit the opportunity in September when it 
becomes available again.
