Dear Mr Kean,

Thank you for your reply. Ultimately I intend to return to Australia, and I
regularly monitor the on-going developments taking place in the Australian
power market (as well as the converging natural gas market). I will
endeavour to contact Mark next week and hopefully discuss Enron's activities
in Australia and areas in which I may be able to contribute.

As I mentioned in my previous email, I am also hopeful of gaining further
experience in international energy markets, particularly the US. I think my
experience and contacts among Asia Pacific countries, and the skills I've
developed, can be applied to the North American market and that I could
offer a very positive contribution to Enron either on the regulatory or
commercial side.

As I am being married in the US this July, and am able to obtain an
appropriate (non-expat) working visa, I would be very interested in suitable
opportunities with Enron either in Houston or other parts of the US. Do you
believe that I am being realistic in pursuing opportunities in the US market
or should I rather concentrate on the Australian market?

Thank you again for your assistance in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Alastair L. Stevenson
Energy Economist (Australia)
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC)

Thanks for your message.  Do you have any interest in returning to
Australia?  We have significant activity in the power markets there and may
need some additional (nonexpat) support.  If you are interested, the person
you would need to speak with is Mark Schroeder (44-207-783-6664), or you
can send me an e-mail reply and I will be sure he gets it.  Mark will be
out next week, but will return the following week.

Subject:  Enron Opportunities in the US



Dear Mr Kean,

I am writing to you following a suggestion from Edith Terry (in Enron's DC
office) that I introduce myself to you with respect to prospective
employment with Enron. I will be permanently relocating to the United
States
just prior to my marriage in Michigan this July and am looking to continue
my career in the energy sector. In particular, I have a strong interest in
the energy revolution taking place in the US, both on the commercial and
regulatory side and I would enjoy working for organisations, such as Enron,
that are leading this revolution. Edith suggested that you may be in a good
position to suggest opportunities within Enron for which I may be suitable.

I am currently based in Tokyo as the Australian energy representative to
the
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC), where I have developed a
strong
knowledge of the Asia Pacific energy market. In this position I have been
closely involved in the development of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply
Outlook, as well as ongoing research in the fields of energy efficiency,
natural gas development and energy pricing. Moreover, as part of my work
with APERC I have maintained a close contact with APEC Energy Working Group
activities, including the APEC Energy Business Network.

Prior to my appointment at APERC, I worked at the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in Canberra. During my term at
ABARE, I was closely involved in the development of the economic research
underlying Australia's position for the Kyoto climate change conference,
and
also in the analysis of APEC (Asia Pacific) energy markets.

For you information, I have enclosed a brief resume which summarises my
background qualifications and experience.
Knowing that you have a busy schedule I would be most grateful for any
advice or assistance you are able to offer.

Yours sincerely,

Alastair L. Stevenson
Energy Economist (Australia)
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC)
