GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS

Cuiaba Pipeline (Bolivia/Brazil)- Joe Kolb reports that construction in the=
=20
Ridges is now proceeding in all areas.  Directional drilling of some of the=
=20
Ridges is progressing more slowly than originally anticipated due to the=20
hardness of the limestone.  Specialists are being called in.  Restoration o=
f=20
disturbed areas is being accomplished at a rapid pace in anticipation of th=
e=20
onset of the rainy season.  Joe will be going to inspect the route along wi=
th=20
Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S South America) next week. =20

RioGen/Eletrobolt PPs (Brazil)- Joe Kolb is waiting for a pipeline=20
reroute-specific conference call to be scheduled (as per the last project=
=20
conference call) to discuss the issues.  Joe conferred with Lauren Goldblat=
t=20
and John Ayers (Enron SA) and John is working to ensure that the conference=
=20
call is scheduled and to ensure that the school/orphanage is avoided.  Bob=
=20
Moss will be presenting his route findings to Lauren, Joe, Susan W., John=
=20
Ayers, Lisa Alderman (Enron SA), and Keith Micelli on Friday, Oct. 26.

Metgas Pipeline (India) - Joe Kolb reports that the approval of the two=20
laterals from the Metgas mainline may delay the overall project.  Lauren=20
Goldblatt offered wise counsel on alternative ways to obtain government=20
concurrence without having a full-blown public hearing.  The goal is to clo=
se=20
financing by the end of March 2001.  Main controversy is not related to=20
environmental matters but associated with ROW acquisition.

Powertel - Joe Kolb received considerable information from Annat Jain (Enro=
n=20
India) on this fiber optic project.  It appears that it will have minimal=
=20
environmental impacts because the cable is being suspended aerially from th=
e=20
existing electric transmission towers and is being buried only at=20
substations.  Impacts will mainly be from the equipment moving along the=20
corridor.=20

ACQUISITIONS

Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington) - Don Stevens h=
as=20
been informed that Enron did submit a non-binding bid for Quebec City.  We=
=20
are currently in negotiations over the terms of our bid and there is at lea=
st=20
one other bidder still in the hunt.  We won't make it to the next round=20
unless we can resolve the terms and conditions sticking points. No further=
=20
due diligence is planned at this time.

Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania) - Don Stevens reviewed DASH=20
(draft) from George Schaefer.  Environmental issues have been addressed in=

storage well locations.  The proposed locations are in the states of=20
Washington, Utah and New Mexico.

Project Toucan -  After meeting with Georgia Pacific management,  Enron is=
=20
not interested in the Brunswich, GA site due to the product being=20
manufactured.  Enron's offer would not be as competitive as others.  Also,=
=20
Enron is not interested in the Woodland Mill as it appears that they have=
=20
operational issues.  Enron will send a couple of engineers to the site for=
=20
review.  Enron will only be bidding on the Leaf River, MS site.  Given the=
=20
altered scope, no work is required in evaluating Brunswick.  By November 1,=
=20
2000 Enron will decide whether to submit a bid for Woodland.  Georgia Pacif=
ic=20
still requires that binding bids be submitted by mid-November and this date=
=20
will apply to both Leaf River and Woodland.  The current schedule has the=
=20
management approval process beginning on November 9, 2000.  Don Stevens=20
conducted a review of documents supplied by Georgia Pacific regarding the=
=20
Leaf River site.  Don Stevens will be conducting a due diligence site visit=
=20
of the Leaf River facility on October 29 - 30, 2000.

ADVOCACY

Pipeline Safety Legislation  - While there is still a slim chance that the=
=20
Senate (McCain) legislation may be included in a last-minute appropriations=
=20
package, most Capitol Hill sources are pessimistic that a bill will be pass=
ed=20
this Congress. The Administration, concerned that it could shoulder the bla=
me=20
for killing safety legislation in Congress, is planning an "Executive=20
Action," which will likely take the form of a Clinton Executive Order, pair=
ed=20
with the release of a DOT rule on integrity management for liquid pipelines=
=20
(which was expected shortly anyway.)

MTBE Legislation -- S. 2962, which passed the Senate Environment Committee =
in=20
September is not expected to be included in any last-minute appropriations=
=20
legislation.  The issue will likely be addressed next Congress.  Enron has=
=20
secured commitments of several key members of Congress that "transition=20
incentives" for MTBE producers will be considered along with any legislatio=
n=20
to ban or limit the product.

Clean Air Act/"Multi-Pollutant" Legislation -- it is likely that next=20
Congress will consider CAA reform legislation, and much attention is alread=
y=20
being paid to approaches to reducing emissions of multiple pollutants (SO2,=
=20
NOx, Mercury, CO2) from the electric generation sector while also fixing=20
problems with the New Source Review program.   Out of concern that merchant=
=20
gas generation, distributed generation, energy efficiency and other "clean"=
=20
solutions might be left out of the discussions, Jeff Keeler and consultant=
=20
Joel Bluestein organized a meeting of environmental groups and competitive=
=20
generation companies (PG&E Gen, Calpine, Trigen, NiSource, El Paso) to talk=
=20
about the inclusion of clean energy/IPPs in a multi-pollutant bill.   We wi=
ll=20
be drafting a legislative solution in the coming weeks so that it can be=20
circulated with environmental groups, utilities, and eventually Capitol Hil=

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE/COMMERCIAL SUPPORT

Clean Air Act/NOx SIP Call Supreme Court Appeal -  The states of Ohio,=20
Indiana, Alabama, Michigan, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia have=
=20
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the NOx SIP call cas=
e,=20
which was upheld in favor of EPA by a federal appeals court earlier this=20
year.   The states (backed by some industry groups) are hoping that the cas=
e=20
will be linked in the minds of the justices to the EPA's appeal of the NAAQ=
S=20
8-hour standard case, which will be heard by the Supreme Court on November =
6.=20
(even though one case held for EPA and the other against)   If the Court=20
decides the two cases are related this could delay a decision until later=
=20
next year, and perhaps sway the court into finding against EPA in the SIP=
=20
case as well.

Clean Air Act/Energy Efficiency -  Mary Schoen is working on several issues=
=20
related to the use of energy efficiency projects to generate tradable=20
allowances/offsets in NOx control programs.  Indiana is developing its NOx=
=20
SIP, and because of the excess of allowances in its budget, would be a prim=
e=20
target for including energy efficiency set-asides. EES is interested in=20
creating such a program, and Mary is working with EES and some of its India=
na=20
customers to advocate the use of energy efficiency projects to meet NOx=20
reduction targets.  Mary is also working in California to find offsets for=
=20
ENA new generation, and has talked with the Bay Area AQMD about using EES=
