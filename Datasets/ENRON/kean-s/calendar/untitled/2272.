Enron's Skilling to Succeed Lay as Chief Executive Early Next Year

12/13/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. named Jeffrey K. Skilling, its current president and 
chief operating officer, to succeed Kenneth L. Lay as chief executive officer 
of the energy giant. 
Mr. Skilling will retain his current posts as president and COO, while Mr. 
Lay will stay on chairman. The change will become effective Feb. 12.
Mr. Skilling, 47 years old, joined Enron (ENE) in 1990 after leading McKinsey 
& Co.'s energy and chemical consulting practices. He became president and COO 
in 1996 and has served on the company's board of directors since then. 
Mr. Skilling has been a major force behind Enron's move into the burgeoning 
commodities-trading business. Started as a traditional gas-pipeline company 
15 years ago, Enron has morphed into the largest trader of natural gas and 
electricity in North America, and a formidable manager of risk in markets for 
an array of products. It has in essence invented markets for trading for such 
nontraditional commodities as unused capacity in fiber-optic 
telecommunications lines and weather derivatives. 
Mr. Lay, 58, became Enron's chairman and CEO in 1986, following the creation 
of the company through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
The change comes after Enron Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton announced his 
retirement in October to pursue other opportunities. Enron said at the time 
it had no plans to replace him.

together and that he has put the rumors of his possible departure to 
Washington, D.C., to rest," said Skilling. "Ken and I have worked together 
since 1990, and we don't want to break up a team that has delivered superior 
returns to Enron's shareholders."

Electric Gold Rush Is Zapping California

Reporter (TM)

The crisis in California's power markets could mean a Christmas bonus for 
Houston energy companies selling power in the state. 
The cold weather that has hit Houston and the rest of the nation has put a 
serious strain on electricity supplies throughout the West Coast.
California electricity prices have soared this week after the state removed 
price caps on wholesale energy transactions to attract power into the market. 
Shares of companies with power plants that sell to the California wholesale 
market have risen in response. 
The lifting of the price caps means more power sales for four Houston 
companies that own about 25 percent of the unregulated power generated in 
California. These include Reliant Energy, Dynegy, El Paso Energy Corp. and 
Enron Corp. 
Reliant also owns power plants in Nevada that can sell power into the 
California market to capitalize on the higher prices now that the price cap 
has been lifted. 
Companies such as Reliant and Dynegy got into California buying plants that 
the state's large investor-owned utilities sold to comply with the law to 
deregulate the state's $23 billion electricity market. There have not been 
any power plants built in California in 10 years. 
The lack of additional generating capacity combined with growing demand is 
the most often cited culprit for California's power woes. Add to that are 
poorly written laws that opened the state to competition. 
The current cold snap has made a bad situation worse. 
A key source of backup power, water-generated hydropower from the Northwest, 
is not being sold in California because it is needed at home because of the 
cold weather. 
"We have been saying for months that new generation is needed in California," 
said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy, parent of HL&P. 
Reliant, through its unregulated operations, is the third-largest nonutility 
power generator in California. 
Making the situation even worse is a tightening supply of natural gas needed 
to burn in power plants and to heat homes. 
One of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to California is El Paso Energy 
Corp. Its pipeline to California is still operating at less than full 
capacity. The pipeline now moves about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day; 
its capacity is 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The company is still 
repairing its pipeline that ruptured in a fatal August explosion in New 
Mexico. 
The El Paso system was named before a Senate committee Tuesday as one of the 
main constraints on California's gas market by John Mazur, the acting 
administrator for the Energy Information Administration. 
Mel Scott, a spokesman for El Paso Energy, said the company has been unfairly 
singled out for criticism. He said the lines' customers have found other 
sources to make up for reduced flow of gas from the El Paso line. 
"We have been getting hammered over this, and we are just one of four major 
pipelines that serve California," Scott said. "Our customers are taking 
everything we can deliver; they physically are taking all of the natural gas 
they can." 
Other large pipelines into California are owned by Williams Cos., PG&E Corp. 
and Trans-Western. 
Whoever is to blame, the reality is that spot natural gas prices in 
California have in recent days risen to the unheard-of price of $40 per 
thousand cubic feet. 
While El Paso cannot take advantage of such prices on its pipeline gas -- 
which is sold under long-term contract -- its wholesale trading arm can 
profit from these prices, as can wholesale trading operations at other 
companies. 
Natural gas prices on the futures market, which have been hitting new records 
daily, dropped sharply on Tuesday on forecasts of milder weather next week. 
Natural gas for delivery in January to the Henry Hub closed at $8.14, down 
$1.26 per thousand cubic feet. 
The relatively small decline in futures prices will not spell any relief for 
California, which is using all of the natural gas it can get its hands on. 
California has been struggling to keep up with growing demand for power all 
year. In response to soaring prices when the weather was hot, the California 
Independent System Operator, which oversees operation of the state's power 
grid, began capping prices, first at around $750 per megawatt-hour, which was 
later decreased to $250. 
The cap was lifted earlier this week to try to lure power supplies from other 
states where generators can get a better price for their power. 
The result has been wholesale electricity prices setting daily records on the 
California Power Exchange, the state's main electricity market. The average 
price paid for electricity to be delivered Tuesday was $904 per 
megawatt-hour, up from $612 on Monday. 
Shares of all of the companies that have merchant power plants in California 
rose this week when the price caps were limited. 
The impact of the changing power market in California is much broader than 
just a quarterly increase or share price bump-up, said Bill Hyler, energy 
analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York. 
With the price caps lifted, and plans to shelve an even stricter $150 per 
megawatt-hour cap that was to be implemented in January, companies will have 
more incentive to get into the California market, Hyler said. 
"The ramifications of this go out for years," Hyler said. "The consumer 
groups were looking for $100 price caps, and you can't make money with $8 to 
$10 gas with $100 price caps." 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to weigh in this week on 
the decision to lift the price caps. Hyler said he expects they will support 
the move. 
Removing the price caps will give companies more incentive to consider 
building new California power plants, Hyler said. But it's not a quick fix. 
It takes about two or three years to get a new power plant sited, permitted, 
built and running. 
The long lead time for constructing new plants also means that the tight 
power supply situation in California cannot and will not be solved overnight, 
even when the weather moderates in the spring. 
This is the second time this year that the California markets have gone into 
a tailspin. 
In May, an unusual heat wave pushed temperatures in the San Francisco Bay 
area into triple digits, causing rolling blackouts. That helped power and 
natural gas companies post much improved second-quarter results. 
During the May heat wave, Dynegy's four California plants ran more than they 
did in all of May and June 1999. 
Such results from unregulated power sales continued into the third quarter. 
Reliant's wholesale energy business had third-quarter operating income of 
$319 million, up from $43 million in the same period last year. About $100 
million of that profit came from the California market, Wheatley said. 
Reliant and other power suppliers were able to provide enough power to get 
California through the hottest months of the year. So far, it has only taken 
about four days of severe winter weather to cause the crisis in California.
