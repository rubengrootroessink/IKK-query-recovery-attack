Subject: 

I have updated the material I sent you yesterday to include information on 
expansion plans of Bonneville and PacifiCorp, the two biggest owners in the 
Northwest Power Pool.  (In the US portion of the pool, BPA has 50% of the 
investment, PacifiCorp about 25% and the remaining IOU's the other 25%.  The 
statement "Bonneville owns 80% of the transmission in the Northwest" is only 
true if you exclude Canada, most of Montana and Idaho, all of Wyoming, Utah 
and Nevada.)  Don't quote the data for PacifiCorp, since it is not final and 
publicly announced.  The Bonneville data is from public sources.
