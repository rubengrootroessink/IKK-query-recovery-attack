Calif Probe Focuses On Dynegy,Mirant Plants-Commissioners    =20
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 05:28 PM=01;ET     =01;=20

By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California officials are focusing an investigation=
=20
into the state's wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated=
=20
by two of the state's largest merchant power companies, Mirant Corp. (MIR,=
=20
news, msgs) and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs) and N=
RG=20
Energy (NRG, news, msgs), according to two commissioners on the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission.=20

The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa=
s=20
withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at=20
Mirant's Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant,=
=20
which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG, near San Diego.=20

All power plants in the state are being examined, but investigators have=20
found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply=
=20
shortages, causing market prices to rise.=20

But so far, the commissioners said, investigators have found no activity th=
at=20
is clearly illegal.=20

"Is it unethical? Yes," one PUC commissioner said. "But is it illegal? No,=
=20
unless there was collusion. This is the system we set up. What the generato=
rs=20
are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize=
=20
your profit to shareholders."=20

Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges.=20

"What we did was both legal and ethical," said Mirant spokesman Chuck=20
Griffin. "There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and=
=20
running. Unequivocally, we have never held anything back."=20

Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units, which are=20
supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand, Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel=
l=20
said. The plant is operated by NRG, but Dynegy markets the power from the=
=20
plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold.=
=20

"We've done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices," Stengell said.=20
"Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day. Our=20
production increases and decreases to follow changing demand. Ultimately, t=
he=20
ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch."=20

A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the=
=20
ongoing investigation.=20

CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her=
=20
office and that of Lockyer's have enough information to take legal action=
=20
against generators next month, though she declined to name the companies=20
involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still=20
under review.=20

"We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up,"=
=20
Griffin said. "This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim=
e=20
is completely bogus. It is pure political rhetoric."=20

Mirant's California power plants have run at full power during critical tim=
es=20
except under one of two conditions, Griffin said. Either generating units=
=20
were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed, or they were beginnin=
g=20
to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to=
=20
get permission to run at full power any longer.=20

"There are no other reasons than those two," said Griffin.=20

Nevertheless, several employees at the power plants involved have testified=
=20
that generating units were ramped down even when the state's Independent=20
System Operator had warned of tight supplies, according to one commissioner=
.=20

And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow=20
Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegy's Houston trading floor to "ramp=
=20
down" the large 951-megawatt plant on at least 10 occasions when he knew=20
power supplies were tight.=20

"We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed=
=20
the megawatts," the employee said. "Then the spot price would go up, but we=
=20
didn't really pay too much attention to that, because as far as we know=20
everybody was doing this. We knew how much power other plants were operatin=
g=20
at, and we knew they weren't at full capacity."=20

NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne=
gy=20
and Dynegy tells NRG what to do. "And there have been conditions when the I=
SO=20
told us to ramp down during Stage 2 emergencies," Moore said.=20

Also, one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the state's deregulation law=
=20
doesn't require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th=
e=20
market.=20

The state's incumbent utilities, who were forced to sell their power plants=
=20
as part of deregulation, also may have contributed to the problem, accordin=
g=20
to an ISO study. By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the=
ir=20
customers projected needs, the state's three main utilities contributed to =
36=20
Stage 1 and 2 power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to=
=20
pay a much higher price to keep the lights on.=20

The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldn't=
=20
have to pay the generators' high bid prices. The ISO market last year had a=
=20
price cap, while other markets did not.=20

Mirant's Griffin, meanwhile, said all the finger pointing isn't solving the=
=20
state's problem.=20

"If they are going to get to a solution in California, they have to get=20
beyond silly political rhetoric," Griffin said. "The real solution to the=
=20
problem is to get new supply, and if they are going to do that they have to=
=20
make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power=
=20
plants."=20
