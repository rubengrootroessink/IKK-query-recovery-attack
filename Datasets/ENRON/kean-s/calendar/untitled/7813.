"Frequently Asked Questions About Implementing Real-Time Electricity 
Pricing in California for Summer 2001"
This paper attempts to address the questions that have arisen in policy 
discussions and press reports about proposals to implement real-time 
electricity pricing for large commercial and industrial customers for the 
coming summer. The paper explains the distinction between real-time and 
time-of-use pricing, contrasts real-time pricing with paying customers for 
demand reduction, and clarifies who would be the winners and losers under 
a real-time pricing program. It also explains why real-time pricing is 
likely to be the most effective approach to reducing the risk of rolling 
blackouts this summer and lowering the total payments that the state will 
have to make to purchase electricity for consumers.
