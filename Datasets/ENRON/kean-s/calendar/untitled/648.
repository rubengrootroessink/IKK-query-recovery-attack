Major activities we have been working on include:
 
 1. Equity selldown issue - Trakya, India
  We have met with OPIC and EXIM and requested that they develop policies to 
guide proposed selldown considerations 
 2.  Azurix - Buenos Aires province water financing.  We have spent 
considerable time with azurix and the lending institutions getting all 
parties geared up for   fall Board consideration 
 3.  Cuiaba
  Conservation program - Woeking in 'washington to resolve concerns about the 
CFCP.
  Cuiaba II - siting of compression station issues.  I am insisting on an 
engineering report that demonstrates the efforts we have made to avoid 
putting compressor stations in the sensitive areas.  Then we will need a 
thorough consultation internally to decide the best way to present our 
conclusions not only to the NGO community but also to our friends who have 
supported us on Cuiaba.
 4.  OPIC in Mexico
  W are working with OPIC to develop a program enabling OPIC to move into 
Mexico.  Scott is working with Max Iziguirre to identify potential project   
leads
 5.  DR - IFC Default.  On June 15 we defaulted on the IFC loan.  We are 
ramping up a campaign to put pressure on the DR in this regard.
