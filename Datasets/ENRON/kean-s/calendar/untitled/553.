Subject: Shareholder Meeting

In light of the shareholder proposal from Friends of the Earth Action, we had 
a third-party consultant gather public record background information on the 
group.  

Friends of the Earth Action is a registered Texas corporation, and acts as 
the political arm of Friends of the Earth, Inc., one of the largest organized 
ecological protection groups with its headquarters in Washington DC.  They 
use a systematic political approach to reach their goals, and when that is 
unsuccessful, they have been known to be disruptive.  Friends of Earth Action 
has taken credit for participation, and even claimed an organizational role, 
in the recent demonstrations in Seattle and Washington DC.  

Their literature describes their immediate goals as targeting six politicians 
and six major corporations for shareholder actions and special publicity.  
Brent Blackwell is described as a 'remarkably effective environmental 
activist' who, over 30 years, has led shareholder actions against Exxon and 
DuPont.  Their literature also portends a link to Cuban successes in 
environmental reform.

Our consultant feels this is a powerful group that should not be taken 
lightly, and that future dealings with this group may be less political and 
more demonstrative in nature.

While we don't expect demonstrations at our shareholders meeting, we have 
augmented our security with additional police and security officers.  
Security presence, while elevated, will be low-key and not any more visible 
to shareholders than normal security.

Regards,

Mike Hicks
