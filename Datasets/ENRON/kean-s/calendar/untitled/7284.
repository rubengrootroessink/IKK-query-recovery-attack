Hi Everybody,
?
As of February 20th, my work schedule is changing  again.
I'll be working from 8a.m. to 4:30p.m. at NCS, and from 6p.m.  to 10p.m. at 
ACT.? If you want to get a hold of me during the week, the  best time to call 
is between 5p.m. and 5:30p.m. or between 10:30p.m. and  11:00p.m.
?
? I don't promise that I can talk for very long at these  times (especially 
not at the 5:00 interval), but if you have a quick question  for me, or some 
information to pass along, those are the times you can do  it.
?
If you want to have a more substantial conversation, you can  reach me on the 
weekend.? After putting in a 60 hour week, I tend to sleep  a little late on 
Saturday.? I suggest calling after 11a.m. if you want a  cheerful, alert 
response.? And of course,? you can always reach me by  email.
?
Phil
