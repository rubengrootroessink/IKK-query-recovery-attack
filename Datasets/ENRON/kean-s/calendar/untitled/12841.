Subject: PEP/PRC Process


While you have received previous correspondence about the PEP system and th=
e=20
PRC process, today, I want to share with you what these processes mean to E=
TS=20
and why they are core to our company=01,s continued success. =20

I believe that any review process must accomplish certain objectives:

? Identify Talent.  First, a review system must help us identify the future=
=20
leaders of functional areas and of our organization.   One of the things I=
=20
like best about the PRC process is that it gives me and the entire ETS=20
leadership team an opportunity to learn about talented employees at all=20
levels of our organization and across Enron. =20
? Demand Performance.  Second, I believe a review process should hold all=
=20
employees accountable for performance.   Performance means understanding ho=
w=20
ETS makes money and adds shareholder value as well as what role an employee=
=20
plays in delivering these results.   This is true whether you are ensuring=
=20
continued safety and reliability, scheduling daily transportation or=20
negotiating commercial arrangements.  If you=01,re unclear on what performa=
nce=20
means in your area, please ask your supervisor to spend time during the=20
mid-year review process helping to define performance for you.
? Provide Feedback.  Third, a review process should provide employees with=
=20
feedback to help improve performance and determine career plans.  Without=
=20
feedback, employees operate in a vacuum in understanding what their=20
supervisor expects of them and what they can do to succeed in their current=
=20
role and in their careers.  While it is never easy to hear constructive=20
feedback, I ask that you keep an open mind and gain as much information as=
=20
you can from the process.  Keep in mind that it is hard to give feedback as=
=20
well.  I am grateful to those mentors in my career who were willing to=20
provide me with the feedback and advice that has helped me to succeed.

We are well on our way to making the PEP/PRC process a good vehicle for=20
accomplishing these objectives.   Last year was the first year that many of=
=20
our employees were introduced to the PRC and, accordingly, people tended to=
=20
focus on the process itself.   Last year we learned a great deal and made=
=20
changes for the better this year. =20

I=01,m confident that this year we can focus on giving and receiving feedba=
ck.

PEP and PRC fit our ETS and Enron values.   While ETS is full of individual=
s=20
that typify the Enron values, PEP and PRC help us to identify talent, to=20
demand and reward performance and to provide important feedback to each=20
employee. =20
