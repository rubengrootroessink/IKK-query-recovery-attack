BusinessWeek is writing a story for its eBiz insert in mid-May about how 
Enron is using the Internet and e-commerce to again transform its 
businesses.  Wendy Zellner, who works out of the magazine's Dallas bureau, 
will be in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday to conduct interviews.

The following are the interview topics and schedule:

Tuesday, May 2

How was EnronOnline conceived and created?
What did you and your group have to do to get EOL up and running?
Did it really take only six months?
How much did it cost to develop?
How does EOL change Enron's existing business?
Does it let you or your customers do anything that they couldn't do before?
How much market share are you gaining and from whom?
How much incremental revenue/profits will you ultimately get from EOL?
How long does a trade take now vs. the old system?
Does the Net make any new products possible?
How does EOL compare to other electronic exchanges being created (such as the 
Dynegy/Williams/eSpeed venture)?
What savings, back office and otherwise, do you get from going online?

Wednesday, May 3
1:30 p.m. - Joe Hirko
Explain the technicalities of setting up this business.
What kind of technology did you have to invest in to make this happen?
How big is the market opportunity, how fast-growing, how profitable?
What advantages/disadvantages does Enron have vs. competitors?
What are the potential roadblocks to creating a truly liquid market for 
trading bandwidth?
Why is it important to have a network and the content delivery services along

West, Atomfilms)

3:30 p.m. - Jeff Skilling
How is Enron using the Internet overseas to reach new customers more quickly?
Germany example -- setting up web site to reach local distribution companies 
quickly -- How many customers has it helped you sign up and in what time 
period?  How long would that have taken under the old regime?
Where else are you using the Internet abroad and with what results?
What kinds of products might go through EOL in the future?
What are the characteristics of the things you'll consider?
In all areas, how does Enron stack up to the competition when it comes to 
using the Internet?
How soon will EOL have competition?
How long-lasting will your first-mover advantage be?
Is the Internet changing in any significant way any other internal processes 
at Enron - i.e. recruiting, purchasing, managing your plants or pipelines?

4:30 p.m. - Sean Holmes
How are you using the Internet to serve the big customers that you're getting 
in the retail energy business?
How is that affecting costs? Communication time?

Mark Palmer or I will bring Wendy to your office for the interview.  If you 
have any questions, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance.
