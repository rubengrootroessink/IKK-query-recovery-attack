Steve--Joe, Rick and I expressed concerns about suing TVA under the NERC 
"agreements".   Richard Sanders wants to have a conference call next week 
with the outside counsel, Bob Madden.

ATTORNEY WORK PRIVILEGE

NERC is establishing penalties for violations of many of its rules, beginning 
in 2000.  I have talked with Kevin Presto and the other operators and 
transmission people and hourly desk repeatedly about this.  Generally, we 
feel that we can remain in compliance and many of the operational rules are 
valid for reliability.  However, then we run into the "interpretation" issues 
that have plagued us this summer.  I think one problem is separating the 
valid "operational" reliability rules from the rules (like ATC) that have a 
huge market impact and can be misinterpreted and manipulated.  Until FERC 
actually reviews and approves NERC rules, I share Rick and Joe's concerns.

I have some concern over the impact to us if we were to take the  position 
you suggest.--  I'm not sure we would be comfortable with NERC rules 
constituting the equivalent of a contract given how "wonderful" so many of 
their rules are. Will be interested to hear from Joe and Christi. Thanks.
