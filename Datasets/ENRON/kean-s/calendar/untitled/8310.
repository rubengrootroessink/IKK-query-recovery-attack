Nick:    If possible, I would like to set up a conference call tonight w/ you 
and Steve.  Steve is traveling to DC today, so it would be 9:00pm (Eastern), 
8:00 pm (Central).  I think that's 10:00 am your time???  I will also call 
and leave you a voicemail message.  Please let me know if that will work for 
you and I will have Steve call you then.

For your information:
here is a coy of the presentation that Steve gave last time he was in Japan.

Please see the attached presentation.
