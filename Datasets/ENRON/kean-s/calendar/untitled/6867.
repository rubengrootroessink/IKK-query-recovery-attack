Hi Folks:

Just a friendly reminder regarding the Partnership & Peer Group Follow-up 
meeting that will take place on December 21st from 8:00 - 10:00 in the 50M 
Exec. Dining Room.  Below are the next steps that we agreed to the last time 
we met.

Next Steps (from Dec. 15 meeting):

1. Refer to page 10 of the document (reviewed by Jon Z.) and take a stab at 
mapping out how each of your current organizations would fit within this 
structure (Commercial, Strategic Professional & Technical and Support Tracks)
2. Begin to build / refine / specify the criteria for a role / position being 
in one or more of the three "Tracks"
3. Highlight / document specific adjustments / key potential "Business Unit 
-specific issues and questions" that should be considered.
4. Begin to develop / suggest evaluation / "PRC" criteria (pages 11 & 12) 

Regards, Gerry G.
