Steve,

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.
