Re: White House Climate Change Task Force

Date:   April 16, 2001


Per your request, here is some preliminary information on the=20
Administration's climate change task force.  First, there is a White House=
=20
climate change task force and it has met at least twice already.  It is=20
coordinated by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic=20
Council.  Emphasis during the first meetings has been on procedure, educati=
on=20
and review of the key issues.

The task force facilitates the Administration=01,s ongoing "cabinet level=
=20
review" on climate change policy.  They are aiming for as high a level of=
=20
participation as possible, but acting and deputy assistant secretaries have=
=20
also been attending.  White House staff is being very tight-lipped about th=
e=20
task force discussions due to political sensitivities and fears of media=20
leaks. =20
=20
The task force will solicit input from outside stakeholders (scientists,=20
industry and environmental groups), but as I understand it, participation o=
n=20
the task force is limited to government officials. =20

The task force is set to meet frequently - possibly weekly - over the next=
=20
six weeks.  I have heard different descriptions of its objectives.  Some ha=
ve=20
said its goal is to develop broad principles, procedures and a strategy in=
=20
preparation for the resumed international negotiations in Bonn, Germany thi=
s=20
July (COP-6 II).  Others suggest that the White House intends to release a=
=20
specific proposal on climate change, with domestic and international=20
components, as early as next month. =20

On the domestic front, Enron has been providing input to the Administration=
=20
on our creative ideas for a multi-pollutant air emissions strategy for the=
=20
power generation sector.  We have been invited to provide input on=20
international proposals, with a preferred timeline of this week.

At this stage, each task force meeting is dedicated to covering a different=
=20
topic (i.e., science, economic impacts, role of technology, etc.).  The=20
meetings tend to have an educational angle, as many participants are not=20
familiar with these specific and technical issues.  The task force has like=
ly=20
not yet delved into analysis of the market-based mechanisms (emissions=20
trading or project-based options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) or oth=
er=20
issues related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate=20
Change/Kyoto Protocol negotiations.

Enron has an excellent relationship with John Howard, the task force=20
coordinator from the Domestic Policy Council.  Jeff and I plan to meet with=
=20
Bob McNally, the National Economic Council coordinator, tomorrow.=20

Jeff and I also would like to talk with you about strategy and=20
recommendations for the White House on international proposals.  It would b=
e=20
valuable for Enron to weigh in supporting:

? Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even in the absence of scientif=
ic=20
certainty on climate change
? Continued U.S. engagement in international efforts to reduce greenhouse g=
as=20
emissions=20
? Flexibility for industry to meet emission reduction goals
? Market-based approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - like emissio=
ns=20
trading - that allow reductions to occur at lower costs to consumers,=20
governments and businesses=20
? Cooperation with developing countries to ensure their participation in an=
y=20
treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - however, developed countries=20
should be encouraged to take action now and work towards solutions

These bullets are consistent with Enron=01,s current position statement. =
=20

I will work to confirm whether the task force has non-government members an=
d=20
how industry and, more specifically, Ken Lay and Enron could participate an=
d=20
provide input.

Please let me know if you have any questions.=20
