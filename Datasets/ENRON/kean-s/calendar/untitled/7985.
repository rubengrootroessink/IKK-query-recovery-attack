State seeks more money for power buys


Updated: March 29, 2001 - 4:41 p.m.=20
Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday asked lawmakers to approve spending $500 millio=
n=20
more to buy power for two struggling utilities as Republicans escalated the=
ir=20
criticism of the Democrat's handling of the energy crisis.=20

Davis' request, expected to win approval from the Legislature's majority=20
Democrats, would bring the state's power purchases on behalf of credit-poor=
=20
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric to $4.7 billion sin=
ce=20
the buying started in early January.=20

Both utilities said they are starting to pay the state back for the previou=
s=20
power purchases, complying with an order Tuesday by the state Public=20
Utilities Commission.=20

Edison paid the state $43 million and PG&E paid $65.2 million for power=20
purchased by the state in January and February.=20

Republicans stepped up their criticism of Davis and his fellow Democrats=20
during an Assembly session Thursday morning.=20

It was the first legislative session since Assembly Republicans chose a new=
=20
minority leader this week, Assemblyman Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, who pledged t=
o=20
take a harder line on energy negotiations.=20

Assemblyman Jay La Suer, R-La Mesa, ridiculed Davis' offer of 20 percent ra=
te=20
cuts for consumers who cut their electricity use 20 percent from last summe=
r.=20

"My people can't save 20 percent. They've already cut to the bone," La Suer=
=20
said.=20

He and others blamed Davis for record rate increases of up to 46 percent th=
e=20
PUC ordered this week for Edison and PG&E customers.=20

Republicans noted that the PUC is dominated by Davis appointees. Davis has=
=20
denied any influence and criticized the rate hike as premature.=20

Eleven Assembly Republicans filed a lawsuit in San Diego Superior Court=20
asking the court to order Davis to provide more details on the state's powe=
r=20
purchases, saying they need the information for state budget decisions.=20

"Governor Davis has an information gray-out," said Assemblyman Tony=20
Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, who led the lawsuit.=20

The lawsuit, similar to one filed last week by The Associated Press and=20
several newspapers, seeks details on long-term power contracts the state ha=
s=20
signed and the short-term purchases it is making for Edison and PG&E=20
customers.=20

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio accused Republicans of engaging in political=
=20
"bomb-throwing and obstructionism," saying the information they want to mak=
e=20
public would help power suppliers get higher prices from the state.=20

He joined Assembly Democrats in accusing the Republican Bush administration=
=20
and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of not doing enough to rein in=20
soaring wholesale electricity costs.=20

"When are we going to realize that we've gotten FERCed?" quipped=20
Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D-Davis.=20

She said Californians are hearing "a giant sucking sound" as their electric=
=20
payments flow to out-of-state electricity generators.=20

Maviglio said the crisis is the product of the 1996 deregulation law signed=
=20
by then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.=20

"To think Governor Davis can clean up this mess in a matter of months is ju=
st=20
ludicrous," Maviglio said.=20

Cox invited Davis to attend a GOP caucus to discuss energy. Davis spent two=
=20
hours briefing Democrats on Wednesday.=20

Also Thursday, the Assembly resumed hearings in its investigation into=20
California's highest-in-the-nation natural gas prices.=20

Southern California Gas Co. Vice President Rick Morrow vehemently denied=20
allegations in a Los Angeles lawsuit that his company conspired with El Pas=
o=20
Gas Co. at a 1996 hotel meeting to drive up California natural gas prices.=
=20

"That allegation is absolutely absurd," Morrow told two Assembly=20
subcommittees investigating the gas price-spike.=20

The companies are defendants in a lawsuit filed last week by the city of Lo=
s=20
Angeles.=20

Chris Garner, director of Long Beach Energy, said the spike has cost his=20
customers between $25 million and $30 million. Long Beach gas prices are ti=
ed=20
to the cost of gas at the California border, which peaked this winter with=
=20
costs up to six times as high as in neighboring states.=20

California has struggled with soaring natural gas prices, rising electricit=
y=20
costs and a tight power supply for months.=20

The state was under a Stage 1 power alert Thursday, with reserves approachi=

The shifting numbers are "amazing," said Paul Clanon, energy division=20

The PUC said PG&E and Southern California Edison had told it that more than=

rates to stay level for thrifty households -- those that use less than 130=

"Those were estimates. Now we've had more time to refine the estimates," PG=
&E=20
spokesman John Nelson said Thursday.=20
While only 31 percent of PG&E's 4.6 million customers use less than 130=20
percent of the baseline amounts, another 13 percent use a little more. They=

would escape higher rates if they conserve by 5 percent, he said.=20
Edison said Thursday it still believes about 45 percent of its residential=

customers will feel no rate hikes.=20
"We don't have any reason to believe there is a problem with our numbers,"=
=20
company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow said.=20
Wall Street and power sellers have consistently hammered California for=20

California Energy Commission estimated Thursday.=20
With that, California will surpass New York, at 11.2 cents and holding, and=

New Hampshire, which is at 11.6 cents but about to drop, according to utili=
ty=20
regulators in those states. Except for Hawaii, at 13.9 cents, no other stat=

comes close to California's new rate, according to October statistics=20
complied by the federal Energy Information Administration.=20
"If there was any doubt in any state's mind that the California deregulatio=

The ratepayer-owned utility district has concluded that rainfall this year=
=20
was so light that every SMUD customer should have to pay a special surcharg=

which it estimates will add $2 a month to a typical household electric bill=

SMUD directors won't vote on a proposed hike until next month, but when the=

half the households would see no hike.=20
And now, SMUD officials are proposing that every customer pay roughly an=20
extra 3 percent for the next year -- one-quarter cent for every kilowatt-ho=
ur=20
they use -- because power production will dwindle at its hydroelectric plan=

That decision came "about when I was able to go out and play tennis for the=

third weekend in a row in March," said Jim Tracy, SMUD planning director,=

referring to the unusually dry month. The surcharge will raise about $24=20

Altogether, SMUD is now forecasting that an average household bill of $67=

If the current rate proposals are approved by directors at their April 19=

=20
That's enough power for roughly 750,000 homes.=20
Some Californians question whether the benefits of swift plant approval are=
=20
worth what they see as potential long-term costs.=20
Carl Zichella of the Sierra Club said regulators should take time to consid=
er=20
the impact on water and air quality, the state's growing population, and=20
danger from earthquakes.=20
"These are certainly things we need to think about before we start plopping=
=20
power plants across the landscape," said Zichella, the group's regional=20
director. "People are going to suffer if we relax these standards."=20
The American Lung Association of California and others want lawmakers to=20
encourage the use of renewable energy and conservation rather than relax=20
environmental standards to build new power plants.=20
"We can't afford to relax our air quality regulations and our public health=
=20
standards," said Paul Knepprath, the Lung Association's vice president for=
=20

California is struggling with a tight power supply caused in part by scarce=
=20
hydroelectricity in the Pacific Northwest, high natural gas prices,=20
California plant shutdowns for maintenance, and construction of few plants =
in=20
the state over the past decade.=20
The state has had widespread blackouts four times this year, including twic=
e=20
last week.=20
Power regulators fear rolling blackouts will become common this summer, whe=
n=20
demand rises sharply as Californians crank their air conditioners.=20
To try to get new power plants online, regulators are crunching what once=
=20
were yearlong reviews into as little as 21 days for peaker plants and four=
=20
months for larger facilities.=20
The environmental portion of the reviews for peaker plants now takes just=
=20
seven days, and the normal requirements of the California Environmental=20
Quality Act have been lifted by Davis under an emergency order.=20
Davis originally said only generators that have new plants online by July 3=
1=20
could take advantage of the speedy review. He moved the deadline to Sept. 3=
0=20
because few could meet the earlier one, said Roger Johnson, siting office=
=20
manager for the California Energy Commission.=20
Winston Hickox, secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency=
,=20
said state officials are "biting our fingernails about whether we can make=
=20
it," but still hope to have enough electricity this summer.=20
"We're truncating the process. We're being as user-friendly to producers of=
=20
new energy as we can, but we are not abandoning our standards," said Hickox=
,=20
whose role has shifted from environmental watchdog to "permitting czar" at=
=20
Davis' direction.=20
Under the previous process, the state Energy Commission took a full year an=
d=20
held 13 public hearings before granting a license to Riverside County's=20
Blythe Energy power plant. Residents were given at least 10 days' notice of=
=20
hearings through newspaper ads.=20
Under the accelerated review, communities can get as little as three days'=
=20
notice of public hearings on plant proposals.=20
San Diego news media were told on a Monday that there would be a single=20
public hearing, three days later, on the proposed Larkspur Energy peaking=
=20
plant. The commission posted the hearing on its Web site, but otherwise=20
counted on the media to let residents know.=20
The California Air Resources Board says it will overrule local air quality=
=20
boards that take too long to grant permits and air pollution waivers.=20
Davis used an executive order to remove restrictions on when peaker plants=
=20
can run so the state can call on them as needed, day or night.=20
The plants also will be allowed to exceed pollution standards by buying=20
"emissions credits" =01) $6,000 per ton of pollutants, which buys them a wa=
iver=20
for three years. The ARB says the plants could emit a combined 3 to 10 tons=
=20
of smog-producing nitrogen oxide each day, triggering complaints from the=
=20
Lung Association that children and the elderly will suffer.=20
Davis also ordered the state Water Resources Control Board to remove limits=
=20
on heated power plant discharge water that would prevent the plants from=20
operating.=20
The state will buy the natural gas to fire up peaking plants, and guarantee=
=20
owners a "reasonable profit" on their plants' operation, said Viju Patel,=
=20
executive manager of the Department of Water Resources. The state will save=
=20
money with long-term gas contracts, he said, while saving operators the ris=
k=20
of fluctuating gas prices.=20
The peaking plants likely to be approved most swiftly are ones without=20
apparent social or environmental problems, the Energy Commission's Johnson=

said.=20
"It can't go in next to a school or hospital," Johnson said.=20
The best sites are polluted commercial land with a gasline and a transmissi=

The Sierra Club's Zichella predicts many of the plants will be built in poo=

industrial communities.=20
"These peaking plants aren't going to be built on Nob Hill," he said. "Thes=

Seyed Sadredin, permit director for the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution=20

Power: Lawmakers propose everything from loans for schools to free insulati=
on=20
in bid to reduce consumption this summer.=20

By JENIFER WARREN and CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--In their quest to cut energy use so Californians can keep=
=20
their ovens and air-conditioners humming this summer, state officials have=
=20
turned to a time-tested strategy: the good ol' carrot and stick.
?????The Public Utilities Commission took care of the stick earlier this=20
week, approving a record increase in electricity rates. Now the Legislature=
=20
is working feverishly on the carrot.
?????More than 190 bills springing from the power crisis are buzzing around=
=20
the Capitol, and a good number aim to coax or bribe us onto a low-watt diet=
.=20
If we resist, state forecasters warn, summer blackouts are inevitable.
?????To ease the pain, lawmakers are proposing loans, tax credits,=20
refrigerator rebates, free insulation for low-income homeowners--even $40=
=20
million for a "mobile efficiency brigade" to deliver power-saving lightbulb=
s=20
to poor people and businesses.
?????Some measures had been stalled as legislators focused on the financial=
=20
crisis afflicting the state's debt-ridden private utilities, which say they=
=20
are on the verge of bankruptcy. But the rate increase stabilized the=20
financial outlook a bit, and now the focus is back on Sacramento.
?????Displaying newfound pep, lawmakers are shaping and blending bills in=
=20
hopes that the governor can sign them by the end of next week--which also=
=20
marks the start of the Legislature's spring break.
?????Energy specialists say there is not a moment to spare. Last week--a ti=
me=20
when temperatures were mild and energy demand was half that of summer--the=
=20
state suffered back-to-back blackouts. Hot weather is fast approaching, and=
=20
some conservation measures take time to put in place and sell to consumers.
?????One estimate by the California Energy Commission says that for every d=
ay=20
the Legislature delays passage of the biggest conservation bill--the sweepi=
ng=20
SB 5X--the state misses the chance to save 20 megawatts of energy, enough t=
o=20
power about 15,000 homes.
?????"It's extremely urgent," said the bill's author, state Sen. Byron Sher=
=20
(D-Stanford). "All the experts agree that reducing demand through=20
conservation is the least expensive, most effective way we can get control=
=20
quickly over the energy market."
?????While the conservation measures are the priority, dozens of other bill=
s=20
addressing some dimension of the energy mess are piling up.
?????One assemblyman wants to make looting during blackouts a crime, and=20
require that law enforcement officials get a warning before blackouts are=
=20
ordered. Another bill would expedite the approval process for new power=20
plants.
?????Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) wants to ensure that=
=20
operators of new California power plants are forced to offer their=20
electricity for sale within the state before marketing it elsewhere.
?????"This is about giving California the right of first refusal," Hertzber=
g=20
said before his Assembly colleagues approved the bill, AB 60X, and sent it =
to=20
the Senate. Without such a requirement, Hertzberg said, California would=20
suffer air pollution and other costs of hosting plants but reap no benefit.
?????That theme--giving California more control over the power supply--also=
=20
runs through a measure sponsored by Senate leader John Burton (D-San=20
Francisco). His bill, SB 6X, would put the state in the business of buildin=
g,=20
financing, acquiring and owning its own power plants.
?????Burton says the bill would enable California to control its own "energ=
y=20
destiny," as other states do, including New York. But Republicans warn that=
=20
it would create a vast new bureaucracy and say that making and selling powe=
r=20
is best done by private industry.
?????Burton's bill has passed the Senate and awaits action in the Assembly.=
=20
But next week's priority, legislators say, will be passing two gargantuan=
=20
conservation bills considered vital to helping California survive summer=20
without widespread power outages.
?????Analysts say the bills--Sher's and a measure by Assemblywoman Christin=
e=20
Kehoe (D-San Diego)--would allocate about $1 billion to programs that could=
=20
reduce summer demand by as much as 4,000 megawatts--the equivalent of what=
=20
eight average-size power plants produce.
?????Forecasts of a summer power shortfall range from 2,500 to 5,000=20
megawatts, said Ralph Cavanagh, an energy expert for the Natural Resources=
=20
Defense Council: "So these bills could really be decisive."
?????And although $1 billion may seem like a sizable investment for applian=
ce=20
rebates, home weatherization, free lightbulbs and other conservation=20
measures, it's peanuts compared to the exorbitant price--close to $4 billio=
n=20
in the last three months--the state is paying to buy energy on the spot=20
market, Cavanagh said.
?????Experts say the conservation proposals--many of which Gov. Gray Davis=
=20
made in February--have a good chance of success because they build on=20
existing programs with track records. While there are "probably lots of=20
great, innovative new ideas out there, we stuck with proven programs becaus=
e=20
we need certainty for this summer," said Claudia Chandler, assistant=20
executive director of the California Energy Commission, headquarters for ma=
ny=20
of the conservation efforts.
?????Cavanagh said the two bills, if signed by Davis, would roughly double=
=20
what California has been spending on conservation. A spokesman for Davis sa=
id=20
the governor would support the $500-million worth of programs he proposed i=
n=20
February, but could not predict the fate of the other $500-million worth of=
=20
proposals likely to arrive on his desk.
?????"As the governor has said, conservation is our ace in the hole and a=
=20
powerful tool to help us avoid blackouts," said the spokesman, Roger Salaza=
r.=20
"We think the half-billion dollars in proposals the governor has put forth=
=20
are prudent and will help us get through summer."
?????Among the proposals in pending legislation are:
?????* $280 million to help low-income families with everything from paying=
=20
their energy bills to installing insulation, double-paned windows and=20
efficient air-conditioners.=20
?????* $170 million to help businesses install power-saving lighting and=20
air-conditioning systems.
?????* $15 million for energy-efficient traffic signals.
?????* $7 million for a school-based campaign, tentatively called "Kids=20
Count," to teach children about energy conservation.
?????* $25 million in loans to schools to help them cut energy consumption.
?????* $10 million to the state Department of Consumer Affairs for a public=
=20
outreach campaign about the need for conservation.
?????* $132 million in loans and rebates for residents and business owners=

who buy new appliances and air-conditioners or upgrade old systems.

2 Firms Start Repaying State for Power Buys=20

Electricity: Edison and PG&E give $105 million for energy supplied between=
=20
Jan. 19 and Feb. 11. Also, a state agency predicts a 7% shortfall this=20
summer.=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--For the first time since California began buying electrici=
ty=20
in mid-January on behalf of the state's two biggest utilities, money is=20
coming back to the state.
?????Under order by state regulators, Southern California Edison and Pacifi=
c=20
Gas & Electric began making payments this week to reimburse the state for t=
he=20
billions it has spent on power. Edison paid $43.5 million and PG&E paid $61=
.8=20
million for electricity supplied between Jan. 19 and Feb. 11, with more mon=
ey=20
on the way, officials said Thursday.
?????California taxpayers became the biggest buyers of power in the West=20
after electricity suppliers began refusing to sell to the utilities, which=
=20
had depleted their cash reserves and tarnished their credit ratings when th=
e=20
cost of electricity soared above their selling price last year.
?????Since then, the state has spent or appropriated $3.8 billion on behalf=
=20
of the utilities, which together serve 24 million people. The repayments=20
began Wednesday, the day after the state Public Utilities Commission approv=
ed=20
consumer rate hikes of as much as 46%.
?????While the PUC action was intended to put the brakes on a runaway energ=
y=20
crisis, there were new signs of disarray Thursday.
?????A group of Republican lawmakers sued Gov. Gray Davis for keeping secre=
t=20
the details of long-term power contracts signed by the state.
?????One of the largest alternative power producers in the West went to cou=
rt=20
to suspend its contract with Edison.
?????And operators of the state's electricity grid predicted that in June,=
=20
California could fall 7% short of the power it needs to avoid blackouts.
?????"California is facing an electricity shortage of unprecedented=20
proportions," wrote the staff of the California Independent System Operator=
=20
in an assessment of summer power supplies.
?????The court action against Edison came from Carson-based Watson=20
Cogeneration Co., one of nearly 700 firms contracted to supply electricity =
to=20
the state's private utilities. Watson filed a complaint in Los Angeles Coun=
ty=20
Superior Court seeking to suspend its contract.
?????Watson has not been paid by Edison since November and is at least the=
=20
third company seeking court release from its utility contract. One such fir=
m,=20
geothermal producer CalEnergy, was granted the right to sell its power on t=
he=20
open market.
?????Watson's complaint comes on the heels of an order by the PUC earlier=
=20
this week that Edison and PG&E begin fully paying small alternative energy=
=20
producers, which together supply more than a quarter of the electricity use=
d=20
by California consumers. Shutdowns by some of these small producers=20
contributed to the state's blackouts last week.
?????Tom Lu, Watson's executive director, said the PUC order failed to=20
provide the assurances his company needs that it will get paid. Many small=
=20
producers have complained that the order slashes the rates that utilities=
=20
must pay the producers to a level that makes it impossible for them to turn=
 a=20
profit.
?????"What we're looking for is the capability to be able to sell to a thir=
d=20
party so that we can get paid for our power deliveries," Lu said.
?????Edison sent a letter to the small producers Thursday, promising to beg=
in=20
paying them by April 16 for power supplied in April. The utility added that=
=20
it expects all the alternative generators that shut down their operations t=
o=20
resume deliveries by Sunday.=20
?????The lawsuit filed by the GOP legislators demanding that Davis open the=
=20
books on the state's long-term energy contracts came on the heels of a=20
similar suit filed last week by a coalition of news organizations, includin=
g=20
The Times.
?????Led by Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), the suit argues that=
=20
under the California Public Records Act, the details of the power buys shou=
ld=20
be made public.
?????Republican lawmakers, who plan to raise money to finance their suit,=
=20
said Davis' withholding of the information prevented them from voting=20
responsibly on the state budget and other important financial matters.=20
California is spending between $45 million and $55 million a day on=20
electricity on the expensive wholesale spot market.
?????"The governor is asking the people in this building to drive down a da=
rk=20
tunnel with the lights off," Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) said in a=
=20
news conference outside the Capitol.
?????Davis administration officials contend that release of the information=
=20
now would jeopardize their efforts to enter into inexpensive, long-term=20
contracts to purchase electricity because bidders would know what their=20
counterparts were offering, and would not offer a lower price. They say the=
y=20
will release the information at a future date.
?????The administration position received a boost this week when Atty. Gen.=
=20
Bill Lockyer issued a legal opinion saying that maintaining the integrity o=
f=20
power-buying negotiations outweighed public disclosure.
?????In other developments Thursday:
?????* U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham met in Washington, D.C., with=
=20
power suppliers to discuss ways to help California avert blackouts this=20
summer.
?????Abraham asked the energy companies to prepare a list of potential=20
problems, including maintenance schedules for generating units, that could=
=20
reduce electricity supplies this summer, an administration official said.
?????* A state energy panel recommended the speedy restart of two gas-fired=
=20
generators owned by AES Corp. in Huntington Beach, on several conditions.=
=20
Power would have to be sold in California, and the company would have to pa=
y=20
$1 million for an independent study into whether its plant is causing ocean=
=20
and beach pollution.
?????The generators could be online by July, according to California Energy=
=20
Commission staff, but area residents would have to endure construction nois=
e=20
20 hours a day. The Energy Commission must still vote on the recommendation=
s.
?????* An executive with Southern California Gas Co. adamantly denied=20
explosive allegations, contained in a series of lawsuits, that it conspired=
=20
with a Texas energy firm to limit natural gas deliveries to California.
?????Testifying before an Assembly oversight committee in Sacramento, Rick=
=20
Morrow, a vice president with the gas company, said "there was absolutely n=
o=20
mystery" to a meeting at which several of Morrow's employees and=20
representatives of El Paso Natural Gas Co. are alleged to have struck an=20
anti-competitive deal.
?????The two companies are alleged to have violated the state's anti-trust=
=20
law, and caused prices to spike, by agreeing not to compete with one anothe=
r=20
on pipeline projects that would have brought additional natural gas supplie=
s=20
into California.
?????Most power plants in California consume natural gas, and the cost of t=

fuel accounts for as much as 60% of the cost of electricity.

Ads Support Davis Actions, Legislature in Power Crisis=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Backers of Gov. Gray Davis are airing radio ads saying the=

governor and Legislature are working hard to solve California's energy=20
crisis, in what could be the beginnings of a campaign against an initiative=
=20
that doesn't yet exist.
?????The ads, airing in Los Angeles and elsewhere, also offer a boost to=20
Davis, at a time when private polls suggest voter skepticism that he is=20

?????Backers of the ad campaign, funded with a relatively modest $100,000,=

say the spots were not intended to help the governor.
?????"The story here is that this group would like to see partisan politics=

who specializes in initiative campaigns and produced the spots. "We need to=

keep people focused on the solutions."
?????Claussen said the group, called Energy for California, could become a=

political organization that would counter initiatives aimed at undoing=20
whatever solution Davis and lawmakers come up with.

considering entering the fray.
?????"I'm flattered," Rosenfield said. "This has to be a first: an ad=20

?????The sponsoring group includes Silicon Valley venture capitalist John=

Responding to San Francisco's plea for better notice to avoid dangerous=20
traffic jams, Public Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood has ordered Pacific G=
as=20
and Electric Co. to share a map of its circuitry with the mayor's Office of=
=20
Emergency Services.=20
The information will help police officers find out more quickly which=20

potential dangers to pedestrians and motorists, said Lucien Canton, directo=
r=20
of emergency services.=20
Police now get only sketchy information from PG&E about the blocks where=20
power might go out, Canton said.=20
"It's vague almost to the point of being useless," Canton said. "When the=
=20
lights go out, we have to go looking for the intersections ourselves."=20
In an order made public yesterday, Wood told PG&E to give as much advance=
=20
warning as possible when outages are imminent. Wood also directed Southern=
=20
California Edison to meet with Huntington Beach officials to work out a pla=
n=20
to address that city's request for such information.=20
But Wood said he was not inclined to issue a global order for the utilities=
=20
to provide detailed information on their circuits with all cities in their=
=20
coverage areas.=20
A broader notification plan may still be in the works, however. The=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's grid, will consider a=
=20
proposal today for an "e-notification" system to help customers and=20
businesses prepare before the lights go out.=20
Under the plan by Carl Guardino, a member of the ISO's governing board and=
=20
president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, utility customers and=
=20
public agencies that wanted the warnings could submit their e-mail addresse=
s=20
to the ISO. The ISO would advise them whenever a blackout was possible that=
=20
day and identify the outage blocks that would be affected.=20
PG&E has been reluctant to publicize the exact borders of rolling outage=20
blocks, saying it was concerned that criminals would head to an area where=
=20
they knew the power was going to go out.=20
To limit the number of people who learn about the outages, Wood told PG&E t=
o=20
submit the block information to the PUC. The commission will then transmit =
it=20
to the San Francisco emergency services division, with strict limits on its=
=20
distribution.=20
The utility must also tell city officials which essential customers, such a=
s=20
hospitals, are exempt from rolling blackouts and which are not. Canton said=
=20
that list will help the city handle emergencies at nonexempt sites and to=
=20
push exemptions for services that now could lose power.=20
PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the utility will comply with any order the=
=20
commission issues.=20
But he said PG&E does not have circuit maps down to the level of specific=
=20
intersections.=20
"Those maps could be developed," Nelson said. "It would certainly be very=
=20
labor intensive."=20
The outage blocks are also constantly changing, he said, and are modified t=
o=20
take into account different usage patterns between summer and winter.=20
Providing detailed circuit maps to all California cities would be "a most=
=20
involved undertaking," Nelson said.=20
PG&E serves 49 of California's 58 counties, including hundreds of cities.=
=20
Nelson said PG&E alerts cities to the possibility of outages as soon as=20
possible, but often gets little advance warning itself from the ISO.=20
The utility has also taken flak from cities that were warned of a possible=
=20
outage, only to have it averted by last-minute power purchases. Some cities=
=20
have threatened to sue PG&E for the extra cost of sending out public safety=
=20
officers who proved not to be needed, Nelson said.=20

Police unsure how to enforce lights-out rule=20
Posted at 10:18 p.m. PST Thursday, March 29, 2001=20
BY DANA HULL=20

Mercury News=20


Two weeks after Gov. Gray Davis ordered businesses to sharply reduce their=
=20
outdoor lighting or face a fine of up to $1,000, police and sheriff's=20
departments across the state say they haven't written a single ticket.=20
The reason: Almost no one has complained about energy hogs, and law=20
enforcement authorities say the governor's outdoor-lighting order is too=20
vague to enforce. They aren't being pushed particularly hard by state=20
officials, either.=20
The governor's executive order required shopping malls, auto dealers and bi=
g=20
retailers to reduce their outdoor lighting by at least 50 percent, starting=
=20
March 15.=20
``How many tickets have been issued? None. And that doesn't surprise me,''=
=20
said Redding Police Chief Bob Blakenship, president of the California Polic=
e=20
Chiefs Association. ``There is a lot of confusion as to how to enforce the=
=20
order. How do you measure what is too much light?''=20
Though the state is desperately scrambling to stabilize power supplies and=
=20
rolling blackouts will likely hit with more frequency this summer, most=20
police departments have chosen to take a ``walk and talk'' approach. They=
=20
remind businesses of the need to reduce energy use when out on patrol, but=
=20
don't seek out or write up offenders.=20
``We're not using any type of heavy-handed approach, that's for sure,'' sai=
d=20
Lt. Rod Romano of the Union City Police Department. ``We're trying to get=
=20
compliance.''=20
Many local businesses say they are conserving, and are as worried about=20
skyrocketing bills as homeowners. But they readily admit that they leave=20
lights on if they feel they need to, and have not received any complaints o=
r=20
words of warning about it.=20
``We're turning them down, but we don't turn all of them off,'' said Art=20
Wicker, general manager of Piercey Toyota in San Jose. ``We close at 9 p.m.=
,=20
and at 10 some of them go off. We've been under the impression that this wa=
s=20
voluntary.''=20
State officials agree that the executive order has created a great deal of=
=20
confusion, and say they regularly field calls from law enforcement officers=
=20
unclear about what they are supposed to do. But they stress that the=20
intention of Davis' executive order was never to hit businesses across=20
California with hundreds of misdemeanor citations.=20
``The intent of this was never to generate prosecutions,'' said Mike Guerin=
,=20
chief of law enforcement at the state's Office of Emergency Services. ``The=
=20
intent was to encourage conservation.''=20
Thursday, state officials and law enforcement officers gathered at a Wal-Ma=
rt=20
store in Bakersfield to remind businesses about the order and encourage=20
compliance. Business support is considered crucial if the state is to have=
=20
enough power for the summer. And state officials say they never expected=20
full-blown energy patrols.=20
``Nobody wants San Jose P.D. officers to take time away from solving violen=
t=20
crimes to tell people about lighting conservation,'' said Guerin. ``But we =
do=20
need to get the message out. Fines are in the toolbox any time an executive=
=20
order is issued.''=20
Though consumers grumble about shopping centers that leave their lights on,=
=20
few take the time to call either the store or police with complaints. But=
=20
that could change in the coming months, as the energy crisis becomes more=
=20
severe. Pressure may build for law enforcement to play a more active role.=
=20
``The proof of the pudding will be this summer, when the need for=20
conservation goes up,'' said officer Don Cox, a press officer for the Los=
=20
Angeles Police Department. ``But we haven't even really developed a policy=
=20
yet about how we will do it. The governor mandated this thing, but wasn't=
=20
specific on how it should be done.''=20
Stanislaus County Sheriff Les Weidman, president of the California State=20
Sheriffs' Association, met with the governor's staff when the outdoor=20
lighting order was first being drafted, and supports the massive conservati=
on=20
effort. But he made it clear that his membership is already stretched thin.=
=20
If rolling blackouts become more frequent, sheriffs will need to respond to=
=20
any safety problems or accidents that arise.=20
``I don't have the resources to divert my sheriffs to running around tradin=
g=20
in pistols for an electric meter,'' said Weidman. ``But by the same token, =
I=20
think the public is real concerned about someone who is wasteful. Ultimatel=
y,=20
if there are a lot of complaints, they may get a ticket.''=20
Weidman also worries about the potential for an increase in crime in darken=
ed=20
alleys or parking lots. The order allows businesses to keep lights on for=
=20
safety reasons, but police say it's difficult to determine when outdoor=20
lights are excessive or crucial: It's subjective.=20
``For years we've told people to turn the lights on to protect themselves,=
=20
and now we're asking them to turn them down,'' said Weidman. ``So we have t=
o=20
be careful. We don't want people to jeopardize their safety.''=20
Though many businesses in the region appear to be complying with the lighti=
ng=20
edict, some say that it's not enough.=20
``Turning down the lights late at night is not going to be the solution to=
=20
rolling blackouts,'' said Assistant Sheriff Bob Maginnis of Alameda County.=
=20
``People are going to have to do other things. If I were in the driver's=20
seat, I'd do scheduled blackouts.''=20

THE San Jose City Council, which unanimously opposed a major power plant in=

The 600-megawatt Metcalf generating plant, fought by Mayor Ron Gonzales and=

beyond the idea stage.=20
Tuesday, the council will consider the application of U.S. DataPort to buil=

a server farm along Highway 237 in Alviso. It demonstrates that compensatin=

When the facility outgrows that plant, however, and relies on the regional=

There's reason to hope diesels will not be needed. Better technology could=

'Interruptible' penalties may be revived=20
PUC to weigh reinstating fines under the conservation pact.=20
March 30, 2001=20
By ANNE C. MULKERN
The Orange County Register=20
To help prevent rolling blackouts this summer, state regulators want to giv=
e=20
businesses a powerful financial incentive to turn off their electricity in =
an=20
energy emergency.=20
The Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday will consider reinstating Southe=
rn=20
California Edison's right to levy huge fines against companies that don't=
=20
unplug when asked.=20
Those financial penalties - which totaled $200 million from November throug=
h=20
late January -- were suspended Jan. 26 after businesses were asked to=20
disconnect 37 times in 10 months.=20
If the penalties are reinstated, it likely will mean millions in new costs=
=20
for Orange County companies in the program.=20
Businesses not only face fines when they don't unplug, they also lose=20
productivity when they do.=20
And fines for not interrupting in the future will come on top of the higher=
=20
electricity rates businesses will be paying. Some of those costs could be=
=20
passed on to consumers.=20
"In this fragile economy and stock market, a company's operational losses=
=20
cannot simply be absorbed," Julie Puentes, spokeswoman for the Orange Count=
y=20
Business Council, said in a protest letter to the PUC.=20
"If this crisis is not managed properly, there will be job layoffs, employe=
e=20
work furloughs, salary cuts, spending cutbacks and companies curtailing=20
investment in California," Puente said.=20
Prior to last fall, companies in the interruptibles program were allowed to=
=20
exit during a 30-day window each November. But after the energy crisis=20
escalated last summer, the PUC in October barred companies from leaving the=
=20
program. Interruptibles contracts expire Sunday, and the PUC wants to have=
=20
new contracts quickly in place.=20
The exact penalties and how the program will be structured have not been=20
determined. The PUC released a draft laying out some proposed changes. But=
=20
revisions to that were being made Thursday and today to address some of the=
=20
comments made by businesses.=20
The draft decision proposes letting customers out of the program under=20
certain conditions, but those conditions are too oppressive for most=20
businesses, Puentes said.=20
Businesses would have to either pay back the discounts they received in 200=
0=20
and 2001 with interest; install energy-efficient equipment equal in price t=
o=20
the total discount they received during that same period; or join a volunta=
ry=20
interruption program in which they cut power just as much, but with=20
more-flexible timing. Under that plan, they'd interrupt but get no rate=20
discounts.=20
"Getting out is extremely punitive to the companies," Puentes said. "If you=
=20
opt out, you're really paying twice. You pay back the discounts, and you=20
still pay the penalties (you've already paid)."=20
Under the plan, public schools, universities, hospitals and prisons could o=
pt=20
out without any repayment obligation.=20
Businesses say they need more options.=20
"You need reliability, and you need flexibility because, frankly, people's=
=20
livelihoods depend on this," said Andrew De Cicco, vice president of ITT=20
Industries, a Santa Ana electronics maker. The interruptibles program, whic=
h=20
began in the mid-1980s, gives some 1,500 large businesses discounts of 15=
=20
percent to 20 percent off their power bills for agreeing to cut off power=
=20
when asked.=20
In the program's first 13 years, companies unplugged just once. But in 2000=
,=20
they were asked to unplug some 24 times. In January alone, they faced 13=20
interruptions including two in the same day. Many complained that the=20
interruptions and fines were significantly hurting their businesses.=20
Astech Manufacturing Inc. of Santa Ana said it lost $480,000 in productivit=
y=20
during the late fall and winter interruptions.=20
ITT Industries shut down four days in January rather than face penalties of=

$700,000 per day. The company said it lost an additional $2 million in=20

spokesman Steve Conroy said. "It was only about 5 percent (of the customers=

Energy crisis could cost billions, says California's controller



By STEVE LAWRENCE
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO, California (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Even with customers paying up to
46 percent more for electricity, California's financial controller
says the state faces a dlrs 7.4 billion shortfall over the next 18
months if it keeps buying power.


But a state Department of Finance spokesman dismissed Kathleen
Connell's dire financial projection, saying it doesn't take into
account the governor's efforts to reduce electricity costs by
signing long-term purchasing contracts with power wholesalers.


Connell estimated California will spend dlrs 26.8 billion buying
electricity the next 18 months for the state's two largest
utilities, which are on the brink of bankruptcy.


Despite the rate increase approved this week and the dlrs 12.4
billion the state is authorized to sell in bonds, she said
Wednesday that California would find itself billions of dollars in
debt by October 2002.


Connell said the problem is that Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers
failed to examine the state's ledgers before buying power for
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.


``We must all work together so the left hand knows what the
right hand is doing. You have to look at the books before
attempting to solve the energy crisis,'' she said.


Department of Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison said California
normally has cash flow problems in October because most of the
state's revenue comes in April.


Just how much California's energy crisis will cost the state has
been hotly debated by state officials, financial experts and
business people. Some predict the power crisis and rolling
blackouts will have a ripple effect through all segments of the
state's economy and even into neighboring states.


``Remember that trends start in California,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development
Corporation. ``I think this is definitely going to create
inflationary pressures, and that is something the Federal Reserve
Bank can't do anything about.''


California's dlrs 1.3 trillion economy accounts for 13 percent
of the nation's gross domestic product and 16 percent of U.S.
consumer demand.


The energy crisis has been blamed mainly on California's 1996
deregulation law, which forced the state's investor-owned utilities
to shed their power plants and buy electricity from wholesalers
while capping the rates they could charge consumers.


SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E say that forced them to the brink of
bankruptcy when energy prices spiraled upward over the past year.
The two utilities say they owe nearly dlrs 13 billion to power
wholesalers who have shut off their credit, forcing the state to
step in and buy electricity.

EPRIsolutions Tackles California Power Problems



PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation=
  -
Power
companies and their business customers need reliable electricity right
now, and Palo Alto-based EPRIsolutions is helping them assess their
options.


A subsidiary of the renowned Electric Power Research Institute,
EPRIsolutions is in a unique position to offer its services to
stakeholders in the California power crisis.


The year-old company takes advantage of the strides made by its
parent company in developing technologies to solve domestic and global
energy problems for electric and gas utility clients.


"We help clients understand the pros and cons of advanced large
central station power systems; we analyze transmission and
distribution bottlenecks; and we offer an assessment of new options
like distributed generation, co-generation, energy efficiency, and
micro-grids," explains EPRIsolutions' CEO, Philip Curtis.


EPRIsolutions' work takes them to all parts of the country, but
California's energy supply and delivery issues provide fertile ground
for their expertise. The state's energy consumers are looking for
answers to their immediate concerns about reliability and premium
power. Distributed generation (DG) -- the siting of small power
systems within cities or near industrial and commercial sites or at
critical load centers -- is a popular suggestion.


"We can provide an objective assessment of all distributed
generation options, including small gas turbines, microturbines,
diesel generators, and fuel cell systems," says Dan Rastler, area
manager for distributed resources. "With our supporting analysis, we
can also help local power providers target the best sites and evaluate
interconnection requirements and power flow impacts."


Rastler believes that DG solutions are here today and can
complement California's plans to invest in large central power
stations. Cities, municipal power systems, and industrial and
commercial companies interested in learning more about EPRIsolutions
services are encouraged to contact Dan Rastler, 650/855-2521 or e-mail
drastler@epri.com.


EPRIsolutions, a subsidiary of EPRI, the collaborative science and
technology organization for the power industry, provides application
and consulting services in the areas of generation, transmission,
distribution, energy efficiency and distributed resources.
