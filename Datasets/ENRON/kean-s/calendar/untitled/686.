Thanks.  I think the one dimension that I would like to see addressed a bit 
more explicitly is:  If the interest in the holding company itself is 
transferred, or the management control of the holding company changes hands, 
e.g., "Enron Corp." (old) is no longer chaired by Lay, who will chair "Enron 
Corp. (new)", but Enron Corp. (old) still is the JV interest owner, in 
addition to the legal requiriements, and consultation with locals you note 
below, is there any risk of "political" interference, such that they might 
extract concessions from the parties to the transaction before it could go 
forward.  Not necessarily fair, but they might have some leverage or perceive 
that they do.  If such a transaction goes forward, the dealmakers want to 
know this, so as to be able to fairly judge the risk, and how to allocate it 
in the deal.  thanks  mcs
