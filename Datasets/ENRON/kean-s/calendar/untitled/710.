Given the sheer amount of work necessary to complete the Disclosure 
Schedules, how about if we revise our request for completion of drafts of the 
Disclosure Schedules to be by the end of the day on Monday, as oppossed to 
this Friday.  We will of course take the information early. 

I have been informed by Cullen Duke as follows:   that the attached list of 
entites has been compiled by Jan Johnson.  It is based on their Hyperion 
system roll-up of companies for management reporting.  It does include some 
companies that we will not want to transfer.  Accounting and tax are jointly 
combing the list to identify such retained entities.  You may be able to help 
Cullen on identifying such entities.

I will be calling the GCs soon to see about setting up a time to call local 
counsels to confirm our thinking on being able to implement the A,B,C 
structure in the various foreign jurisdictions.  As part of that "call" 
relates to regulatory matters, Rick Shapiro and others will be involved, as 
well as  Bill Weiland, from V&E.  We would like to set up these calls to go 
through the structure and discuss the issues identified with the local 
counsels very soon.  They will obviously need some time to reflect on the 
various issues.  

Again, all remains highly confidential.

Thanks for all the help.  Lance.
