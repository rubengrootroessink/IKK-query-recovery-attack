Bush vs. price caps: Economists correct a faulty power lecture


(Published June 5, 2001)=20

In his recent commencement address at Yale University, President Bush salut=
ed=20
the C students in the graduating class: "I say you, too, can be president o=
f=20
the United States." But when he lectured California last week on the evils =
of=20
electricity price controls, the joke seemed less funny. What America's most=
=20
famous C student didn't learn in economics class is costing the state dearl=
y.=20
"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase=20
supply," Bush said in his Los Angeles address, repeating a standard lesson=
=20
out of introductory economics textbooks. Unfortunately, as 10 energy=20
economists from universities around the nation made clear last week in an=
=20
open letter on the state's electricity crisis, Bush must have missed the=20
later chapters.=20
The textbooks' admonitions against price controls apply to competitive=20
markets. When competition breaks down, giving one or a few producers the=20
ability to control prices, the textbooks are equally firm that regulation i=
s=20
needed to keep them from exploiting consumers.=20
That's the situation confronting California -- and federal regulators.=20
Electricity markets here long ago ceased to be competitive. Because of a=20
flawed market structure and a temporary imbalance between supply and demand=
,=20
generators learned last year that they had market power: By withholding=20
supply at key times and places, they drove up the price of power beyond the=
=20
level that would otherwise prevail in a competitive market.=20
"We cannot expect a market to operate to benefit consumers ... if effective=
=20
competition does not exist," the economists said in their letter. "In this=
=20
case, cost-of-service prices are an obvious remedy."=20
They noted that several useful proposals have been submitted to the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for temporary price restraints on=20
wholesale prices. These would last only until new plants now being built co=
me=20
online to alleviate the shortage.=20
Such restraints could meet the federal legal requirement that prices be "ju=
st=20
and reasonable" without discouraging construction of new power plants or=20
generation from existing plants, which is needed to keep the lights on this=
=20
summer. In fact, as some economists have pointed out, the right kind of pri=
ce=20
controls could actually increase supply by removing any incentive for=20
generators to withhold electricity to game the market.=20
Bush's regulatory inaction is producing an unprecedented transfer of wealth=
=20
from California households and businesses to the generating firms, a shift=
=20
that endangers the health of the state's economy. Unless FERC or Congress=

Stereotypes cloud the complexity of energy issue
By Dana Wilkie=20

June 5, 2001=20
WASHINGTON -- When Gov. Gray Davis refers to those Texans taking California=

to leave is one of greedy and unscrupulous Republicans who probably look li=
ke=20
oil baron J.R. Ewing.=20
And when Bush administration officials sniff that Californians got themselv=
es=20
into this energy mess, they seem to be conjuring up the image of=20
short-sighted, tree-hugging Democrats who care more about Alaskan caribou=
=20
than about people.=20
Even if Davis and Bush shook hands and appeared civil in California last=20
Tuesday, the previous weeks of discord between the two left an indelible=20
impression on the public, experts said -- one colored by stereotypes that=
=20
easily strike a chord with voters but that also cloud the complexity of the=
=20
energy issue.=20
Those stereotypes pit the languid, Birkenstock-wearing Californian against=

as when many in this country maligned Arabs during the 1970s oil embargo,=
=20
attempts to create victims and villains in the current energy crisis easily=
=20
appeal to public emotion.=20
Davis, a Democrat, recently invoked the image of hand-to-hand combat with a=
=20
fearsome foreigner: "We are literally in a war with energy companies, many =
of=20
which reside in Texas," Davis said after Bush, a Texan, released his energy=
=20
plan.=20
The image is straight from an old western.=20
"Gray Davis is playing John Wayne against the guy with the black hat," said=
=20
Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the Universi=
ty=20
of California Irvine. "You sound like a socialist if you demonize middle-ag=
ed=20
white guys in suits who own capital. You sound like a cowboy with a white h=
at=20
when you demonize oil barons."=20
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, another Democrat, plopped a black hat on Vice=20
President Dick Cheney, architect of Bush's energy plan: "You have the vice=
=20
president sounding like an oil man."=20
Said Petracca: "Of all the possible images that one could pick, the oil bar=
on=20
is the easiest to manufacture. It has the deepest cultural resonance, becau=
se=20
people have been exposed to this imagery on TV stations for years and years=
."=20
Helping to bolster that image, of course, is the fact that both Bush and=20
Cheney worked in companies involved with oil.=20
While Bush professes no part in the blame game -- "He's not interested in=
=20
finger-pointing," said White House press secretary Ari Fleischer -- Cheney=
=20
raised the stereotype of the superficial, mollycoddled, air-headed=20
Californian. On a national news program, he called California's electricity=
=20
deregulation scheme "harebrained" and Davis' suggestion that Bush allowed=
=20
price-gouging "goofy."=20
"You have a war of two biases," said Jack Pitney, a government professor at=
=20
Claremont McKenna College. "The bias of Texas as greedy and money-grubbing,=
=20
and the bias of California as shallow and narcissistic."=20
No matter how unrepresentative, these stereotypes are a way for the Davis a=
nd=20
Bush administrations, and the national political parties, to convince voter=
s=20
whom to blame for the energy mess. That one of the parties should be a=20
"culprit" is itself somewhat disingenuous, since the crisis has roots that=
=20
run across Republican and Democratic administrations.=20
Davis' once-stellar public approval ratings have withered, as Californians=
=20
increasingly disapprove of how he has handled the crisis. Facing re-=20
election next year and a considered a presidential prospect in 2004, the=20
governor often reminds Californians that the crisis grew out of a Republica=
n=20
deregulation scheme, and that he is working around the clock to build new=
=20
power plants.=20
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, recently portray=
ed=20
power-company executives as criminals: "I would love to personally escort=
=20
(Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share=
=20
with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,'=20
" Lockyer said.=20
Meanwhile, national Democrats have aired a TV ad in the Long Beach district=
=20
of GOP Rep. Stephen Horn that says the congressman teamed with Bush to oppo=
se=20
price caps that might have offered relief from summer blackouts.=20
"It's a short-term effort by Davis to blame (others) for his difficulties,=
=20
but it's also part of a longer-term national Democratic Party effort to mak=
e=20
a case that the administration is rather friendly to the big-energy=20
interests, and less friendly to conservationists," said Bruce Buchanan, a=
=20
University of Texas expert on the presidency.=20
If gasoline prices stay high, or if California's electricity problems spill=
=20
over into other states, it may be Bush -- and Republicans running in next=
=20
year's elections -- who land in trouble with the public. The GOP fears that=
=20
voters may perceive Republicans as the monopolistic and environmentally=20
unfriendly tools of oil companies.=20
In the 1970s, politicians found an easy culprit for long lines at gas=20
stations and high fuel prices: They preyed on stereotypes of Arabs.=20
"All you had to do was show a bunch of Arab sheiks -- who already look to u=
s=20
sort of exotic -- meeting in some country that makes people think of=20
international terrorism," said UC Irvine's Petracca. "Bingo -- you have som=
e=20
people to blame."=20
Now, as then, the images have little to do with reality.=20
Ben Paulos, who promotes alternative power with the Energy Foundation, said=
=20
"it's a simplification" to paint the culprits in California's energy crisis=
=20
as Texas oil companies.=20
"These are international companies that own things all over the place," he=

said.=20
In fact, most of the privately owned power generators in California are own=

"It's not a question of whether these people are good or bad managers," he=

said. "It's simply more efficient to keep these people in place."=20
Marks said that when PG&E first proposed the bonuses last month, the=20

about 226 top executives.=20
PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn and nearly two dozen other senior managers would=

While there is no reason to believe that PG&E's managers would have dragged=

Sacramento -- Saying it is being shortchanged, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=
=20
filed suit yesterday challenging the amount of money California will get fr=
om=20
consumers as reimbursement for buying electricity.=20
The suit filed with the state appellate court in San Francisco claims that=
=20
the California Public Utilities Commission is giving the state too big a=20
share of the monthly revenue collected from consumers -- all at PG&E's=20
expense.=20
The suit by PG&E was expected. If the utility wins, it could make it harder=
=20
and longer for the state to recoup its power purchases.=20
The state stepped in to purchase wholesale electricity for the utilities=20
after their credit soured as power costs skyrocketed. The state has spent=
=20
more than $7 billion so far with reimbursement expected from consumers.=20
Earlier, Southern California Edison filed a similar legal challenge.=20
At issue is the amount of money the utilities receive from consumers and th=
e=20
amount given to the state to cover electricity purchases.=20
PG&E contends that the PUC's calculation puts the utility $2.2 billion in t=
he=20
hole because state regulators underestimated the cost of running the nuclea=
r=20
power plant at Diablo Canyon and the cost of contracts with alternative=20
energy producers, like solar and wind generators.=20
The utility wants its share of consumer revenue increased, leaving less for=
=20
the state.=20
Under a bill lawmakers passed in January, it was the calculation of how muc=
h=20
of consumer money was needed to reimburse the state for energy purchases th=
at=20
would dictate how many bonds the state could sell to repay itself.=20
The limit on bond sales was four times that calculation, totaling about $13=
=20
billion.=20
But both utilities challenged the PUC's initial decision, saying it was too=
=20
generous to the state.=20
Fearing legal action from the utilities, lawmakers passed a second bill in=
=20
May that delinked the authorization to sell up to $13.4 billion in bonds fr=
om=20
the calculation of how much consumer money the utilities receive.=20
That bill allows the bond sale to happen as early as Aug. 14.=20
As a result, yesterday the Davis administration and State Treasurer Phil=20
Angelides said the utilities' move did not affect the bond sale, scheduled=
=20
for late summer.=20
"This doesn't create chaos, it just means we can't sell the bond until the=

Critics say Calpine plan too generous=20
Posted at 10:35 p.m. PDT Monday, June 4, 2001=20
BY MIKE ZAPLER=20

Mercury News=20


In what would be a highly unusual break for a local business, San Jose=20
officials are proposing to rewrite city law and spend tens of millions in=
=20
taxpayer funds to ease construction of Calpine's controversial power plant =
in=20
Coyote Valley.=20
The provisions highlight just how far the city has come on Calpine's propos=
ed=20
600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center. Just months ago, city leaders stood in=
=20
solid opposition to the $400 million project, threatening lawsuits and othe=
r=20
tactics to block it. Now, those same officials appear ready to go to=20
extraordinary lengths to make Metcalf happen.=20
Part of an agreement reached last week by Mayor Ron Gonzales and the compan=
y=20
would require the city to pay $50 million upfront to extend a recycled-wate=
r=20
pipeline needed to cool the power plant. Calpine will reimburse San Jose fo=
r=20
just $10 million of that cost, far less than the city had sought, and will=
=20
make its payments over 30 years.=20
Another clause would allow Calpine, which reported an increase in=20
first-quarter profits of more than 400 percent, to spread over 10 years a=
=20
$3.9 million sewer connection fee. That would be a first for the city.=20
Typically those levies are collected upfront; the city council would have t=
o=20
amend a law that set a five-year limit on sewer connection payments.=20
``I'm not comfortable with that,'' said Councilman and Metcalf opponent=20
Forrest Williams, whose District 2 would be home to Metcalf. ``They're a ve=
ry=20
profitable company .?.?. they should pay the connection fee.''=20
Councilwoman Pat Dando said the overall agreement, set to be considered by=
=20
the council this afternoon, is probably the best the city could do under th=
e=20
circumstances. But she added: ``I believe Calpine's payment should be the=
=20
same as other businesses that develop in San Jose.''=20
The money for the pipeline would come from a fund to expand and increase th=
e=20
reliability of the entire recycled-water system. Projects the city had=20
planned to build sooner would have to be delayed, but the water pollution=
=20
control plant would not raise rates to pay for the Metcalf extension,=20
environmental services director Carl Mosher said.=20
Company at advantage=20
The criticized provisions are part of a larger package settled on after=20
roughly five weeks of negotiations. The talks occurred in a political=20
atmosphere that heavily favored the power company: Gov. Gray Davis endorsed=
=20
Metcalf in April, and the California Energy Commission is widely expected=
=20
this month to override the city's November denial of the plant.=20
Mayor Ron Gonzales and Calpine executives defended the deal, saying its=20
unusual terms were tailored to a unique project.=20
Metcalf, they said, would become the city's biggest customer of recycled=20
water, consuming an average of 3 million gallons daily -- or nearly one-thi=
rd=20
of the current total usage -- to cool the plant. That would help the city=
=20
achieve its goal of reducing freshwater usage and diverting more water from=
=20
the San Francisco Bay for ecological reasons.=20
And the city would receive other concessions from Calpine, supporters say,=
=20
including two extra air-monitoring stations and $6.5 million mostly for par=
ks=20
and open space.=20
``The energy crisis requires us to do business differently than we have in=
=20
the past,'' Gonzales said. ``When you take the entire package it's a win-wi=
n=20
for the city.''=20
Critics, while acknowledging that Calpine had a commanding position at the=
=20
bargaining table, say the city still is giving up too much. They questioned=
=20
why Calpine is paying only $10 million -- one-fifth of the total cost -- to=
=20
extend the water pipeline, when Metcalf will be its sole customer, at least=
=20
in the near future.=20
The city entered negotiations with Calpine wanting the company to cover the=
=20
entire $50 million cost of the pipeline extension, a senior city official=
=20
said. Others involved in the negotiations say that was never officially=20
broached by the city, although Calpine development manager Ken Abreu=20
acknowledged that ``obviously the city would have been happy for us to pay=
=20
for as much of the pipeline as possible.''=20
That's what the city should be demanding, said Issa Ajlouny, a resident of=
=20
the Santa Teresa neighborhood adjacent to Metcalf and leading opponent of t=
he=20
plant.=20
``This agreement is giving away millions of dollars of our money,'' he said=
.=20
``The city should be outraged.''=20
Early last year, according to city officials and transcripts of a Californi=
a=20
Energy Commission hearing, the city and Calpine had an understanding that t=
he=20
power company would pay at least $25 million to $30 million for the=20
recycled-water line if the power plant were built. If San Jose decided to=
=20
construct a larger pipeline to serve more customers, the city would make up=
=20
the difference.=20
Deal fell apart=20
But that informal arrangement fell apart when Metcalf emerged as a major=20
political battle. Gonzales came out against the plant in June 2000, and the=
=20
council went on to vote against it in November.=20
By the time the negotiations began, Calpine didn't really need the city's=
=20
help. All indications were that the California Energy Commission would=20
override the city and approve the plant anyway.=20
What emerged from the talks was a $10 million payment, spread over 30 years=
,=20
from Calpine for the recycled-water line. Company officials say that 20=20
percent is roughly the same share of the pipeline capacity Metcalf would us=
e.=20
The other 80 percent has yet to be allocated, but officials said they hope =
to=20
sign up other recycled-water users, such as golf courses.=20
``Our perspective is we're doing what's fair,'' Calpine's Abreu said.=20
As the agreement heads to the council this afternoon, some neighborhood=20
activists are accusing the council of trying to suppress public debate.=20
Often, controversial neighborhood issues are heard at evening sessions to=
=20
give working residents a chance to be heard.=20
``This certainly creates an appearance that they're trying to stifle public=
=20
input,'' said Elizabeth Cord of the Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group. She=
=20
said consideration should be delayed until the next evening council meeting=
=20
June 18 to give residents time to review the document.=20
But Gonzales said he's not inclined to defer the item. He said today's=20
meeting is already filled with difficult land-use decisions.=20
``We have already heard from the neighborhood,'' he said. ``It was their=20
concerns we negotiated.''=20

than $11 wholesale.=20
That such numbers demand an explanation was about the only thing President=

Bush and Gov. Gray Davis could agree on when they met in Los Angeles a few=
=20
days ago to discuss California's energy crisis. Mr. Bush assigned Patrick H=
.=20
Wood III, a fellow Texan confirmed last month as a member of the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission, to investigate.=20
To many experts, the woes of California's natural gas market are as profoun=
d=20
as those of its electricity market: the state is short on pipelines, and th=
e=20
rules of the gas market, critics say, encourage sellers and traders --=20
including the biggest local gas utility -- to drive prices higher.=20
At peak times, half of California's electricity is generated by gas-fired=
=20
power plants, a higher proportion than in most parts of the country. And=20
because 85 percent of the gas consumed in California comes from outside the=
=20
state, the shortage of pipelines both into California and within the state=
=20
has become a big handicap in fueling those plants. The strain has become=20
especially acute as drought in the Pacific Northwest has curtailed imports =
of=20
hydropower and gas-fired power plants have worked overtime to meet the=20
demands of a booming state economy.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney's energy policy report last month proposed=20
initiatives to speed approval and construction of new pipelines, noting tha=
t=20
New England and other regions faced capacity squeezes, too. The report says=
=20
that the United States needs 38,000 miles of new gas transmission pipelines=
,=20
almost a 20 percent increase.=20
In the meantime, some industry executives and public officials take the=20
argument one step further than the Bush administration, contending that=20
today's shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies,=20
intent on maximizing profits, to manipulate prices.=20
''It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market,'' said=
=20
Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the Hous=
e=20
energy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to scrutinize the California gas market. ''Reasonable people cou=
ld=20
conclude people have gamed the system.''=20
In one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern=20
California Edison, one of the state's struggling electric utilities, have=
=20
accused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline in=
to=20
the state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing=
=20
and accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the=
=20
state's failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy=20
commission is hearing the case in Washington.=20
But fingers are pointing in other directions, too.=20
For example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state's largest gas=
=20
utility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year --=
=20
activity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for=
=20
consumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that t=
he=20
trading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline spac=
e=20
during peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power=
=20
demands.=20
At the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put=20
enough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business=20
customers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the mark=
et=20
in the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping pus=
h=20
gas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains.=20
Between them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7=
=20
billion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends.=20
Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading h=
as=20
harmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators=
=20
and industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for=
=20
managing their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last=20
year. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only =
11=20
percent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the sa=
me=20
time during the prior two years.=20
Another problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a=
=20
member of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rul=
es=20
intended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost=20
certainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and=20
electricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow=20
electricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher.=20
Similarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial=
=20
trading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics=
=20
question whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives=
=20
energy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight=20
markets.=20
Federal regulators ''don't seem to understand that firms are really trying =
to=20
make as much money as they can,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=
=20
University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the=
=20
Berkeley campus. ''That's what they do for a living.''=20
Fixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. ''If you build more=20
capacity,'' he said, ''you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce th=
e=20
ability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power.''=20
Regardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California=20
natural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimon=
y=20
has shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company's marketing=20
affiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900=
=20
million over the next 13 months.=20
El Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to=
=20
other companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to=
=20
limit El Paso's exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactio=
ns=20
were with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to=20
people present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California=20
officials.=20
An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the=
=20
other side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the=20
pipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise o=
f=20
gas prices in California.=20
Federal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may no=
t=20
be legitimate, have proposed requiring companies selling gas in the state t=
o=20
disclose extensive data about their transactions. They are also considering=
=20
whether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity tha=
t=20
were eliminated early last year.=20
Further, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which=20
energy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large=
=20
customers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators=
=20
have oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments,=
=20
but they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey=
=20
said.=20
''The whole thing has fallen through the cracks,'' he said.=20
Nearly all of California's gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain=
=20
states and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In=20
California, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to=
=20
consumers and to underground storage fields for later use.=20
Those pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 3=
00=20
million cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. T=
he=20
difference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300=20
