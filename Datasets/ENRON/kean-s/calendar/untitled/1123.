The commission just passed on a 3/2 vote the Duque position.  Duque was the 
plan where "approximately 70% of all residential customers who consume 500 
kWh or less will pay no more than $68 per month for electricity."  "The plan 
will alsoensure that the approximately 70% of all commerical customers who 
consume 1,500 kWh or less will pay no more than $220 per month."

Commissioner Lynch fears that the Duque plan will be tied up in legal 
disputes rather than provide rate relief to the consumers.
