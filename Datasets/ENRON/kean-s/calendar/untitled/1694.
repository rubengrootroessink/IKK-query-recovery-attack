GERMANY: European power trading set to grow further - Enron.

FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The volume of electricity trades will continue 
to expand in continental Europe, a senior Enron executive said on Wednesday. 
"Portfolio shifts as well as high oil and dollar prices will continue to 
boost the number of transactions," Gregor Baeumerich, Enron's head of 
continental European power trading, told an IIR conference on energy trade. 
"There are no natural limits to market growth."
According to Enron estimates, German, Austrian and Swiss power trades in 2000 
will amount to a combined 1,500 terawatt hours (TWh) - versus actual 
consumption of 975 TWh - of which Enron will account for around 375 TWh. 
Although the underlying physical demand was not growing, the process of 
market liberalisation had already caused a dramatic acceleration in trading 
activities, said Baeumerich. 
Enron's continental European turnover of 136,7 TWh in the third quarter of 
2000 represented a 10-fold increase over the corresponding 1999 quarter. 
The number of market participants - counting traders, exchanges and new 
trading floors at established energy companies such as municipal utilities - 
in that period had risen to 180 from 100 a year ago, according to Enron 
estimates. 
In future, the number of new entrants would offset those participants lost 
due to the simultaneous concentration process, Enron believed. 
Trade in transmission contracts for a variety of time periods were now 
established both over the counter and at electricity exchanges in Germany, 
the biggest market in its own right, Baeumerich said. 
Next year should also see the emergence of power options. 
But on Enron's wish list for improved German trading conditions were clear 
rules on how to handle bottlenecks at border entrance points, he added. 
Enron also wanted export and import fees to be waived and traders allowed to 
apply for transmission schedules from grid operators after the currently 
observed 1430 local time deadline. 
Instead, Enron favours short-term trading with a one hour lead time - for 
example in response to sudden weather changes which impact on electricity 
needs. 
Baeumerich also reported that usage of Enron's online trading platform for 
power, gas, and coal, introduced a year ago, already accounted for 60 percent 
of total worldwide turnover. In Europe, the figure was 50 percent.
