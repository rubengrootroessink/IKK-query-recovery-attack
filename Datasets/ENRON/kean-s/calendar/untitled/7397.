Congratulations to Tom Briggs and the entire Pipeline Safety Improvement Act 
working group for passage of this legislation today by the Senate, in a 98-2 
cliffhanger.  One troublesome amendment was seriously considered, but a 
watered down version was worked out b/t Senators Corzine and Breaux.  In its 
stronger version, the amendment would have imposed mandatory five year 
inspection standards on the industry.   Our initial understanding of the 
language suggests it contains flexibility needed by the industry.  We will 
reserve judgment until we see the language. But it appears this is a good 
victory for the pipeline safety team.  We still have many hurdles on the 
bill, including potential for much mischief in the House.  The Senate bill 
contained some troubling provisions, but we wanted it passed today "as is" in 
order to avoid larger problems.  This goal was largely achieved.  
Congratulations team!

P.S.  The Senate used the opening speeches on the bill to have a rather 
dogged discussion of the California energy crisis.  All the usual suspects 
were on the floor opining on the issue.
