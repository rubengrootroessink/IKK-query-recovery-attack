Late yesterday Austin State District Judge  Paul Davis, a Democrat, release=
d his ruling in the Texas congressional  redistricting case.  The plan he d=
elivered was an apparent surprising  victory for Republicans, accomplishing=
 most of the  objectives sought through their own proposals.=20
Initial observations: =20
*  One of  the two new seats is in the coastal bend region between Corpus C=
hristi and  Houston extending north toward the Austin area.  The other is a=
long  the border between El Paso and Laredo -- Henry Bonilla's (R-San Anton=
io)  district has been drawn into the Hill Country and Central Texas.    Lo=
ok for former Texas Secretary of State, Henry Cuellar (who just resigned  t=
his week) to run in that district rather than challenge Bonilla as has been=
  speculated.=20
*  Ken Bentsen (D-Houston) was drawn into Sheila  Jackson-Lee's (D-Houston)=
 district.  That's the only pairing. =20
*  Gene Green (D-Houston) was drawn out of his district -- which  becomes 6=
0% Hispanic -- and into a nearly 60% Republican district. =20
*  Max Sandlin (D-Marshall) gets all of Tyler and Longview  (Republican vot=
es), Jim Turner (D-Carthage) gets Bryan/College Station  (Republican votes)=
 and northwest Montgomery County (Republican votes), and  Charles Stenholm =
(D-Abilene) grabs the northwest and southwest corners of  Tarrant County, p=
utting all three in BIG trouble.=20
*  Martin Frost's  (D-Dallas) district becomes about 8-10 points more Repub=
lican, making him  vulnerable.=20
*  Kay Granger's (R-Fort Worth) district becomes 4-6  points more Democrati=
c, making her vulnerable.=20
The preliminary read  is that if this plan stands up -- and it looks pretty=
 solid on voting-rights  grounds -- Republicans will pick up at least two s=
eats, and more likely  somewhere between four and six.  That would mean the=
 Texas delegation goes  from 17-13 in the Democrat's favor to 18-20 GOP sea=
ts of the 32 total (with 2  added this year) and makes it more likely the G=
OP retains control of Congress in  2002.

Texas Democrats Suffer Setback

By Thomas B. Edsall
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, October 4, 2001; Page A08 A Texas state judge has ordered new con=
gressional districts to be drawn that  would likely end the House career of=
 Democrat Ken Bentsen and would threaten the  reelection of at least four o=
ther Democrats: Charles W. Stenholm, Jim Turner,  Max Sandlin and Chet Edwa=
rds.The ruling is a devastating blow to the national Democratic goal of sta=
ying  even with the GOP in the congressional redistricting process and winn=
ing control  of the House next year. Republicans contend that the judicial =
plan keeps them on  track to pick up as many 10 seats nationwide."What real=
ly hurt us in Texas is that a Democratic judge made the ruling,"  said a De=
mocrat involved in the process. In private, aides to Rep. Martin Frost  (D-=
Tex.), the principal architect of his party's redistricting strategy in Tex=
as  and nationally, had said that the assignment of Judge Paul Davis to the=
 case  increased the likelihood that Democrats would get a positive decisio=
n.Yesterday, Frost issued a statment claiming confidence "that the Texas  d=
elegation's Democratic majority would be reelected under the map," but he a=
lso  made clear that there would be a legal challenge. "The map adopted tod=
ay would  divide several Hispanic and African American communities to dilut=
e their voting  strength in likely violation of the Voting Rights Act. . . =
. It eviscerates many  existing districts where minority communities elect =
the candidates they choose  to represent their interests."Democrats now fac=
e the more daunting task of trying to persuade an East Texas  federal court=
 to accept more pro-Democratic lines. Republicans contended that  the Davis=
 map, which has priority in court proceedings, would conservatively  produc=
e at least three new GOP seats -- including the two new seats added to the =
 delegation because of the state's population increase in the 2000 census.T=
he current Texas delegation has 17 Democrats and 13 Republicans. With the  =
addition of two new seats, Republicans contended that, after 2002, they wil=
l  have at least an even delegation, 16-16, and perhaps as much as an 18 to=
 14  advantage, depending on a number of factors, including President Bush'=
s  popularity in November 2002.An aide to Bentsen acknowledged that "we got=
 the short straw on this one."  Bentsen would be forced to run against fell=
ow Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, who  is black, in an overwhelmingly minorit=
y district. Bentsen may now give stronger  consideration to running for the=
 Senate seat from which Phil Gramm (R) will be  retiring.Stenholm, who has =
been able to win in GOP-leaning counties, said he is  prepared to run and w=
in whatever the district lines are.While partisans on both sides expect the=
 majority of states' redistricting  plans to end up in court, Republicans h=
ave contended that they will emerge from  the process with a net gain of ei=
ght to 10 seats. Democrats have contended that  the process will be a wash,=
 with neither party coming out ahead.Just last week, Democrats won what is =
likely to be their biggest victory in  the process, creating seven district=
s in Georgia with Democratic voting  histories of at least 55 percent. If t=
he Democrats win those seats, their  triumph will amount to a four-seat pic=
kup.In most states, the battle involves just one seat at most; and in many =
cases,  the two parties are agreeing to protect incumbents with no change.T=
he GOP controls the process in Michigan, where the party is likely to pick =
 up two seats. The GOP also controls the process in Pennsylvania, Ohio and =
 Florida; and in each, Republicans hope to gain two or more seats.
