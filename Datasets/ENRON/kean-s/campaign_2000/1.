The New Power Company Challenges Green Mountain Energy

10/30/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

GREENWICH, Conn., Oct. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- The New Power Company (NYSE: NPW) 
characterized as "completely false" the October 23 contention of Green 
Mountain Energy Company that PECO did not negotiate in good faith with 
regards to its award of its "Competitive Default Customers" to The New Power 
Company. The New Power Company filed its response to Green Mountain's October 
23 protest of the contract award to New Power on Monday October 30. 
New Power's filing described the PECO bidding process and how New Power 
submitted its winning bid within the bidding period established by PECO in 
its RFP. By contrast, Green Mountain only submitted its current bid 12 days 
after the bidding deadline and nine days after it was informed that its 
higher priced bid had not been selected and PECO and The New Power Company 
had begun negotiating the CDS Agreement.
In its protest to Green Mountain's October 23 filing, PECO confirmed that 
Green Mountain submitted its untimely "revised" bid nine days after PECO had 
selected the New Power bid. PECO explained that Green Mountain only underbid 
New Power after it learned it had lost the award. 
H. Eugene Lockhart, president and chief executive officer of The New Power 
Company said, "We were awarded this contract fairly, following all proper and 
specified procedures. We were selected because we submitted the best price 
and because we agreed to satisfy the renewable power source requirement 
required in PECO's RFP. Green Mountain's position is completely misleading. 
Green Mountain is trying to change the rules of the game after the game is 
already over." 
The New Power Company is fully confident that the Pennsylvania Public Utility 
Commission will resolve this matter in its favor. 
The New Power Company was formed in May 2000 to provide electricity and 
natural gas directly to households and small businesses in the deregulated 
energy marketplace. The company draws on the expertise, experience and market 
strength of such industry leaders as IBM, AOL and Enron to bring savings and 
efficiencies to energy consumers.

In a press release Monday, New Power said it filed the response to Green 
Mountain's Oct. 23 protest of the contract awarded to New Power on Oct. 30.

will resolve the matter in its favor. 
Last Wednesday, the commission agreed to review the dispute over the contract 
award.

America Online Inc. (AOL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM).

Speculation Swirls On Gore, Bush Energy Cabinet Posts

10/30/2000
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--While the rest of the country waits to see who will be the 
next U.S. president, speculation in Washington has already turned to likely 
Cabinet members responsible for energy and environmental issues. 
For the most part, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are keeping 
their own counsel on likely Cabinet members in prospective Democratic and 
Republican administrations. But from sources in and out of government some 
possible choices have emerged.
For Gore, one name mentioned for secretary of energy is Sen. Richard Bryan, 
D-Nev., with longer odds seen for two others: Tom Grumbly, who formerly 
headed a nuclear weapons cleanup effort at the Energy Department, and Deputy 
Energy Secretary T.J. Glauthier. 
For Bush, possible picks include Tom Kuhn, a buddy from Yale and head of the 
Edison Electric Institute, and Kenneth Lay, 1996 Republican convention 
chairman and chairman of the giant gas and energy concern Enron Corp. (ENE) 
Another possible Republican pick for Energy would be Montana Gov. Marc 
Racicot, a leading spokesman on land issues in the West. 
Racicot may be a more likely pick for top job at the Interior Department. But 
if Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., loses his race for re-election, Bush might tap 
him for Interior. 
On the Gore side, speculation about Interior is all over the lot. There's 
Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber; former Colorado Gov. Roy Roemer, who now runs the 
Los Angeles school system; Sen. Bryan; George Frampton, acting head of the 
White House Council on Environmental Quality and former Wilderness Society 
director, and former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth. 
Bush's director for the Environmental Protection Agency might be David 
Struhs, a moderate in the minds of environmentalists who directs the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection. Two more-conservative prospects are 
Chris DeMuth, a regulatory expert at the American Enterprise Institute, and 
Russell Harding, head of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality. 
For Gore, a front-runner appears to be Kathleen McGinty, former head of the 
Council on Environmental Quality under Clinton. Another possibility is 
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, stepping aside to elevate Lt. Gov. Kathleen 
Kennedy Townsend.

Guessing the new Cabinet while Gore, Bush campaign
By DEB RIECHMANN
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2000. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - While the rest of the country waits to see who will be the 
next president, in this city - where politics is both vocation and avocation 
- a lot of the speculation is about who will be in the next Cabinet. 
The top economic post? For treasury secretary, George W. Bush could pick 
former Federal Reserve member Lawrence Lindsey, who has been traveling on 
some of Bush's campaign trips. Or someone from Wall Street. Al Gore might 
well keep the incumbent secretary, Lawrence Summers, in hopes of keeping the 
economy thriving.
If Bush wins, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson or the school superintendent from 
Houston back home in Texas could wind up in his Cabinet - along with a 
handful of people who served in his father's administration. 
If Gore wins, newcomers could include the mayor of Detroit or the governor of 
Maryland, or North Carolina, or Delaware - but with many positions going to 
familiar faces from the Clinton administration. 
And whichever man wins, the job running the Department of Agriculture could 
go to the same person - veteran Texas Rep. Charles Stenholm, who is in danger 
of losing his seat to redistricting. 
Richard Holbrooke, with a foreign policy resume stretching back to Vietnam 
and Lyndon Johnson, is the frequently heard choice for secretary of state in 
a Gore administration. And everyone - even Bush, it seems - expects Colin 
Powell to get that job in a Bush administration. 
On the campaign trail, Bush introduces the former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff as "a man who used to be in government, and if all goes well, 
well. ..." 
Holbrooke, who is ambassador to the United Nations, isn't a sure thing for a 
Gore Cabinet. Speculation also includes former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell and former Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton, who was chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
For the most part, the presidential candidates are keeping their own counsel 
on their likely Cabinet members. They may be the only people who are. From 
sources in and out of government, these are some possible choices: 
FOREIGN POLICY: 
In addition to Holbrooke, Mitchell or Hamilton at State, conventional wisdom 
has Gore's foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth, as a shoo-in for national 
security adviser. 
Joining Powell at the top of foreign policy under Bush would be Stanford 
University scholar Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser. She served 
in President Bush's White House. 
DEFENSE: 
Frequently mentioned for the Pentagon in a Bush administration: Paul 
Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Richard Armitage. Of the three, Armitage has 
been the most active in the Bush campaign, traveling with the candidate on 
trips when the candidate touches on defense policy. 
Wolfowitz, dean of international studies at Johns Hopkins University, was 
undersecretary of defense for policy when Dick Cheney, Bush's running mate, 
was defense secretary. Perle, defense braintruster at the American Enterprise 
Institute, was assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration. 
Armitage was ambassador to the newly independent Soviet states and he served 
at State and Defense under President Bush. 
A possible Gore Pentagon chief, former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., was chairman of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig, 
who served in Jimmy Carter's Pentagon, is another possibility. 
TREASURY: 
Should Gore win, Summers could stay on. Other names being floated: William 
Daley, secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration and head of Gore's 
campaign, former Fannie Mae chairman Jim Johnson and Steve Rattner, a 
Democratic contributor who is a partner in a private equity firm, Quadrangle 
Group. 
Bush's most prominent economic adviser has been Lindsey, who was appointed to 
the Federal Reserve Board by Bush's father. Lindsey has been on many recent 
Bush campaign trips. 
A name heard on Wall Street is Donald Marron, who runs the PaineWebber 
brokerage house. John Cogan, a Stanford University economist and policy 
adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, also is said to be in the running. 
Cogan also has accompanied the Texas governor on campaign swings. 
JUSTICE: 
If Gore wins, some former Justice Department officials think the next 
attorney general could be Charles Burson, former Texas attorney general and 
the vice president's current chief of staff. 
Other contenders are Eric Holder, the current deputy attorney general, and 
Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Supreme Court justice in Michigan. 
Still other names are Gore's brother-in-law Frank Hunger, formerly an 
assistant attorney general; former deputy attorney general Jamie Gorelick, 
now vice chairman at Fannie Mae, and Walter Dellinger, former solicitor 
general. 
Often mentioned for Bush is Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who was No. 3 at 
Justice during Bush's father's administration; Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who 
helped Bush prepare for his debates, and Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., should he 
lose his re-election bid. 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: 
Current Secretary Donna Shalala appears headed for a university post but is 
the choice of some women's advocates for White House chief of staff under 
Gore. 
If Gore wins, Surgeon General David Satcher could be given HHS. He's a former 
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
Other names: Leon Panetta, former White House chief of staff and President 
Clinton's former budget director; Alice Rivlin, also a former Clinton budget 
director and Federal Reserve Board member; David Kessler, former 
administrator of the Food and Drug Administration, and Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, 
former administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which 
oversees Medicare and Medicaid. 
One other name is former Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., a Gore campaign aide. 
If Bush wins, American Red Cross president Bernadine Healy is a possible 
choice. President Bush appointed her to head the National Institutes of 
Health. 
Two others: Gail Wilensky, who helped craft Bush's Medicare prescription drug 
plan and directed health care financing in his father's administration, and 
Bill Roper, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North 
Carolina and a former director of the CDC. 
EDUCATION: 
A Bush possibility is Rod Paige, superintendent of the Houston Independent 
School District who has appeared with Bush to talk about education in Texas. 
Another is Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the National Education 
Goals Panel. (His experience with welfare reform could make him a pick for 
secretary of health and human services as well.) 
Other Bush possibilities: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, Colorado Gov. Bill 
Owens and Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction, 
a staunch supporter of charter schools and vouchers. Also, a possible 
Democrat in Bush's cabinet: former Dallas Democratic Party chairman Sandy 
Kress, who has been an informal adviser. 
Figuring in the Gore speculation are North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who is 
seen as a conciliator respected in both parties, Delaware Gov. Tom Carper and 
White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed. 
AGRICULTURE: 
Rep. Stenholm, a conservative Democrat who could lose his seat when Texas is 
redistricted, is being mentioned in both political camps. 
Other Bush possibilities include Ann Veneman, former agricultural 
commissioner in California and a senior Agriculture Department official in 
the Bush administration; Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Charles Kruse, a 
Missouri farmer and former state agriculture commissioner. 
Other names on the Gore side: Rep. Cal Dooley, D-Calif.; Rep. Gary Condit, 
D-Calif., and two Agriculture Department undersecretaries, August Schumacher 
Jr. and Jill Long Thompson. 
COMMERCE: 
Insiders were at a loss to name prospective GOP candidates, saying more 
visible Cabinet posts would have to be decided first. 
If Gore is elected, Norman Mineta, the first Asian-American member of the 
Cabinet, might be asked to stay on. Or Labor Secretary Alexis Herman might 
move over. The names of top fund-raisers Peter Knight and Terry McAuliffe 
also are being mentioned. 
EPA: 
Bush's EPA director might be David Struhs, a moderate in the minds of 
environmentalists who directs the Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection. Two other, more conservative, prospects: Chris DeMuth, a 
regulatory expert at the American Enterprise Institute, and Russell Harding, 
head of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality. 
For Gore, a front-runner appears to be Kathleen McGinty, former head of the 
Council on Environmental Quality in the Clinton White House. Another 
possibility is Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, stepping aside to elevate Lt. 
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. 
INTERIOR: 
On the Gore side, speculation is all over the lot. There's Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber; former Colorado Gov. Roy Roemer, who now runs the Los Angeles 
school system; Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada; George Frampton, acting head of 
the White House Council on Environmental Quality and former director of the 
Wilderness Society, and former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth. 
For Bush, bets are on Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who has been a leading 
spokesman on land issues in the West. If Sen. Slade Gorton loses his race for 
re-election in Washington, however, Bush might tap him. 
ENERGY: 
If Gorton gets Interior, Racicot might end up at Energy. Other possible Bush 
picks include Tom Kuhn, a buddy from Yale and head of the Edison Electric 
Institute, and 1996 GOP convention chairman Kenneth Lay, chairman of the 
giant gas and energy company, Enron. 
For Gore, one name mentioned is Bryan, the Democratic senator from Nevada. 
There are longer odds for two others, Tom Grumbly, who formerly headed a 
nuclear weapons cleanup effort at Energy, and Deputy Energy Secretary T.J. 
Glauthier.

XL Capital Creates Weather-Risk Reinsurer

10/30/2000
Best's Insurance News
Copyright 2000 (c) A.M. Best Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

HAMILTON, Bermuda (BestWire) - XL Capital Ltd. formed a new reinsurance unit 
to provide weather-risk-management insurance, reinsurance and financial 
products. 
The new unit, Element Re, will offer noncatastrophic weather risk-mitigation 
products designed to protect against the negative impact that normal weather 
fluctuations can have on the financial performance of companies in a variety 
of industries, XL Capital said in a statement.
Element Re will be led by Chief Executive Jeffrey Bortniker and Lynda 
Clemmons, president and chief operating officer. "Until now, businesses have 
had a limited choice in terms of how they managed their weather-related 
risk," Bortniker said. "To date, derivatives have been the primary mechanism. 
We have identified a growing demand for weather protection in insurance 
form--something that is more appealing to corporations around the world." 
Clemmons added that the primary market for weather-related-risk-management 
products is expanding beyond the traditional customers, such as energy and 
utility companies, to include agriculture, construction, retail, 
transportation and entertainment. 
Element Re is one example of the movement by traditional property/casualty 
reinsurers into new markets, in response to declining demand for traditional 
reinsurance and new competitors (BestWire, Oct. 23, 2000). 
A recent report from insurance consultant Conning & Co., "Property-Casualty 
Reinsurance: Developing the Next Frontier," said demand for traditional 
property/casualty reinsurance will continue to decline for the next five 
years as primary insurers consolidate, grow bigger and improve their ability 
to manage their own exposures. 
The Conning study found that traditional reinsurers have been hurt by lack of 
demand, which sparked price competition to retain market share. As a result, 
many reinsurers are exploring alternative markets to expand their businesses. 
Element Re's risk management team previously formed the core of the weather 
derivatives group at Enron North America, an energy company. 
Element Re Advisors Inc., Element Re Capital Products Inc. and Element 
Reinsurance Ltd. are subsidiaries of XL Capital Ltd., a provider of insurance 
and reinsurance coverage and financial products to industrial, commercial and 
professional services firms, insurance companies and other enterprises 
worldwide. 
The financial strength of XL Capital Ltd. is rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best 
Co.

Biz - Managing
Thinking ASP? 
Don't Forget Security! 
Before you sign a contract with an ASP, don't forget to scrutinize its 
commitment to keeping your organization's data secure. By Deborah Radcliff
Deborah Radcliff

10/30/2000

(Copyright 2000 by Computerworld, Inc. All rights reserved.)

If the rapid convergence of business and the Internet isn't enough of a 
security threat, there's now a new bugaboo keeping information technology 
managers up at night: application service providers (ASP). 
"You've now got a third party responsible for the integrity, confidentiality 
and availability of your data," says Pete van de Gohm, director of 
information asset protection at Enron Energy Services Inc. in Houston.
Once an organization has handed its applications over to a third party, its 
biggest concerns include who's handling and accessing that data and what 
guards the connections from the outside, says Amit Yoran, CEO of RipTech 
Inc., a security services firm in Alexandria, Va. "ASP users are worried 
about the connectivity from the customer to the ASP and how that's protected 
from the Internet," he says. 
While ASPs say they won't offer any guarantees, many put standard security 
offerings in their contracts, such as firewalling and traffic monitoring. But 
those who want to earn the business of the Fortune 1,000 companies are also 
agreeing to contracts with specified custom security requests for additional 
fees, such as scanning the content of incoming mail, setting up and 
maintaining virtual private networks or managing firewall and intrusion 
detection services. 
"Some ASPs are looking at the big picture," says Mitchell Hryckowian, senior 
director of security and infrastructure at Interliant Inc., an ASP in 
Purchase, N.Y. Interliant, for example, appends its contracts with a security 
clause to provide basic traffic monitoring services. In addition, high-end 
customers can demand -- and receive -- customized security services be added 
to their contracts. 
The Threat 
Tony Parziale, chief technology officer at online fashion retailer Folded 
Edge Inc. in Duluth, Ga., negotiated for customer-centric security clauses 
with his ASP, now-defunct Pandesic LLC in Sunnyvale, Calif. [Page One, Aug. 
7] 
"Security clauses in the initial Pandesic contract were very vague," Parziale 
says. So he worked out service-level agreements for customer credit-card 
security on transactions and data security for Folded Edge's SAP modules in 
addition to setting minimum access and connectivity requirements. 
Because his ASP partnered with several back-end service providers, getting 
these assurances was complex. For example, Intel Online Services in Santa 
Clara, Calif., set up Folded Edge's frame-relay connection and served as 
Pandesic's back-end host. It was up to Parziale to track down Intel's 
security controls before he could request contract specifications. 
Folded Edge didn't encounter any security problems during its two and a half 
months with Pandesic, something Parziale attributes to beefed-up security 
clauses in the contract between Pandesic and Folded Edge. But that contract 
didn't protect the company when Pandesic went out of business, leaving Folded 
Edge without an ASP since September. 
As Folded Edge searches for another round of funding to get back online, 
Parziale is looking for an ASP that handles its own hosting, security and 
Internet connectivity so he doesn't have such a tough time tracking down 
security policies from multiple vendors. 
Additional Measures 
Having sat through hundreds of contract negotiations himself, Hryckowian 
advises potential ASP customers to read the entire contract carefully. In 
addition, he suggests that you: 
1. Prequalify the security backgrounds of those who deploy security at your 
ASP. 
2. Inquire about service-level agreements that suit your business needs. 
3. Make sure the contract also includes maintenance windows for regular code 
upgrades and patches. 
4. Balance acceptable risk against security requests. 
5. Know the security products and tools the ASP will deploy. 
6. Define what action the ASP will take in case of a breach. 
Even with the most comprehensive coverage, ASPs make no guarantees.
