Hi guys, per my e-mail yesterday, the House believes they still have a 40% 
chance to pass a comprehensive bill this Congress.  Joe Hartsoe, Charles 
Ingebretson and myself will attend today's meeting referenced below and 
report back.  Other participants include TXU, Unicom, APPA, NARUC, Southern 
Company, etc. (Watkiss is on a plane, we were just notified of this meeting 
at 10 am this morning.)  We'll report back.
