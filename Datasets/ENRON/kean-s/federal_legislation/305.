Attached below is the 70 pages of legislative language of the Chairman's Mark in the Senate on electricity.  Undoubtedly this will be massaged and amendments readied for the markup planned for next week.  Of course, this being the Senate, even the schedule could change.  Based on meetings and contacts thus far, staff is only starting to read the text and hear from outside folks.  Note that the document is in Word Perfect, not Microsoft word, so your computer needs the software to convert it.

    I'm attaching an electronic copy of Division B of the Chairman's Mark, which
the Committee will take up next week.
    This miracle of modern technology will, of course, make it much faster and
easier for you to draw amendments to the mark without having to retype the base
text.  We would prefer that you draft "cut-and-bite" amendments that show the
text you propose to strike and the text you propose to insert, rather than
substituting large blocks of text with no indication of the differences between
what you are proposing and the original text.  But if you do use the electronic
text to substitute large blocks of text, kindly remember that the rest of us
will still need to figure out how your amendment differs from the original text.
 It would help everyone who has to make sense of your amendment if you could
also share a "redline" version that shows the actual changes.
    It would also help if we can circulate amendments to each other as early as
possible.  Regrettably, most amendments were not circulated until very late the
day before the markup on Division E, and we would like to do better this time. 
The Committee staff stands ready to help you draft amendments and to consider
whatever you propose fairly and objectively, but that becomes infinitely harder
after normal business hours on the night before the markup.
