As discussed for the last several days, attached is the latest version of the 
"Pat Wood transmission straw man."  It is virtually the same as what I sent 
to you earlier with the exception of some lettering changes.  Our initial 
comments are that "H" and "K" are non-starters for Enron and that "C (3)" 
must be changed to read:  "that all users of transmission facilities within 
the RTO will be under the same rates, terms and conditions of the same tariff 
to ensure non-discriminatory access to the electric transmission grid under 
non-discriminatory rates, terms and conditions;".

Please advise as soon as possible (i.e. close of business today) should there 
be additional issues raised in this context.  Many thanks.
