Subject: Revised Electricity Emergency Authorities Memo



Here's a first draft of the emergency powers memo Sarah put together with 
V&E.  We are still awaiting one more section on the Federal Reserve's 
authority.  As you will note, there is remarkable authority vested in the 
President, including eminent domain.  Please note page 7, which read in 
combination with footnote #4 gives wide authority to the Federal government.  
Let's decide soon how we want to use this memo.  Thanks.
