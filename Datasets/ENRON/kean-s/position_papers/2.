Here is Adrian Moore's White Paper on price caps, which incorporated some 
points from my mini paper on the subject.

This looks like a good start and something that we can boil down to a "We 
Believe" one pager for think tanks or economists to sign on to as a potential 
next step.

Do you want to route comments through me for Adrian and give me your thoughts 
about how best to market this?  At this point it is "our paper" but with the 
RPPI tag line.

- Rob

Sorry about the delay--I spent a painful (but worth it) amount of time  
yesterday doing media--two long press interviews and a ridiculous amount of  
time working with Fox News O'Reilly Factor show, then going out to their  
studio, meeting with O'Reilly and taping the show. ?Came out really good,  
though, I think I did much better than the Greenpeace hack he had on after  
me, who called me an "OPEC spokesman"! 

Anyway--attached is the draft. ?As soon as I get your comments I will  
finalize it and we will get it sent out to the relevant Congressmen, and  
perhaps to some other targets as well. ?Rob--your advice on where to send it  
will be welcome, and of course you guys can distribute it as you please.
