Michelle, this  summarizes what I have learned thus far about possible circ=
umstances of the  Busch letter.
=20
John Tysse at EEAC  indicated that the new leadership at DOL and at OFCCP i=
s very business  oriented.  The new OFCCP director is Charles James; he was=
 the EEO manager  at Bell Atlantic.  However, he is new in the job, of cour=
se, and has not  had any opportunity to review enforcement policy issues.  =
Thus, Tysse is  not aware of any policy shifts to date, nor is he aware of =
any volume mailing of  the kind of letter Enron received.  Tysse is hearing=
 that DOL and OFCCP  leadership will probably take a cautious (i.e., delibe=
rate) approach to changes  so as not to unnecessarily provoke outbursts fro=
m Congress or advocacy  groups.  But the word is that policy reevaluations =
will occur.  (This  includes the EEO survey, which Felicia asked about this=
 morning, although  Tysse speculated that the survey issue might be too pol=
itically  charged to drop altogether; perhaps it will be reworked to be mor=
e  manageable.)  While there has been no indication of a formal enforcement=
  policy shift as to Dubray cases, Tysee said he is aware of another ongoin=
g case  where the national office appeared to be pulling the strings, even =
though the  region was still handling dialogue with the contractor.
=20
Len Bierman, the  former career Deputy Director at OFCCP who is now a consu=
ltant, said about the  same thing as Tysse as to the new DOL and OFCCP lead=
ership being sensitive to  issues that concern business and the fact that t=
hey have not been in place long  enough to effect changes yet.  (There is n=
ot yet an Asst. SOL for  Employment Standards.)  He is not aware of any pus=
h to clear out Dubray  cases pending in the national office.  However, he k=
nows Busch well from  their agency days and does not believe he is strongly=
 committed to the Dubray  methodology because he understands its deficienci=
es.  His guess is that the  letter may signal a desire by the national offi=
ce to find a way to get your case  off their docket.
=20
I have sent an email  (you are blind copied) to some folks at law firms aro=
und the country to see  if they know of similar letters being sent.  I will=
 keep you advised.   Best regards. =20
