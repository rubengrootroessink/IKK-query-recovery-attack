Subject: Communication Plan Preparatons

Gentlemen:  The California Project is now moving from phase I into phases I=
I=20
with respect to commuication/PR activities:

Phase I--No major leak/"no comment policy".  The only communications=20
responses (ESA Employee Memo, Employee Q&As for Elektro and Cuiaba, and=20
Q&Asfor vaious stakeholders) required to date were prompted by the TV (Bom=
=20
Dia) news story and Gazeta Mercantil article. =20

Phase II--Major leak requiring disclosure.  While prospective buyers have=
=20
signed CAs, there's always the possibility that news of the Project and/or=
=20
elements from the IM could be leaked--either inadvertently or by design. =
=20
While this scenario is unlikely, we need to be prepared to respond before=
=20
there is an actual sale of assets.  A draft press release has been prepared=
=20
for Ken Lay, confirming that Enron is considering the sale of its assets in=
=20
South America.  There is also a set of generic Q&As, which is being expande=
d=20
to include stakeholder-specific Q&As.  The ESA Employee Memo (May 8) is als=
o=20
being modified.

Phase III--With the IM out, CAs signed and data rooms open, we should begin=
=20
to implement parts of the Communication Rollout Plan to demonstrate the=20
strength/success of the business strategy, limit speculation and provide=20
greater sense of certainty to important stakeholders.  The activities that =
we=20
can undertake now, include:

? Contact lists--Develop comprehensive contact lists of all=20
audiences/stakeholders.  Include names, addresses, phone, fax,, and email. =
=20
Put into Excel format.  Identify who internally "owns" each list. =20

? Speaking platforms--Develop list of speaking opportunities to introduce=
=20
Enron's business model and announce our regional strategy. =20

? Audience communications map=01*Develop a matrix that details the specific=
=20
communications strategy for key stakeholder audiences.  It should cover:=20
? *Timing: when should this audience be communicated with, e.g., before=20
public announcement, simultaneous with public, etc.
? *Form: what form should the communication take, e.g., written,=20
face-to-face, e-mail, conference call, employee meetings, etc.=20
? *Content: what is the message to be delivered
? *Responsibility:who=01,s responsible for creating communication; who with=
in=20
company will deliver communication=20

? Communications training/message delivery preparation -- Key company=20
spokespeople need to be prepared to delivery the strategic messages regardi=
ng=20
transactions, but also to deftly handle difficult questions from employees,=
=20
analysts, customers and the media regarding the company's ultimate plans fo=
r=20
the region.  It will be essential that all spokespeople are delivering the=
=20
same message and are well prepared for difficult situations.=20

? Fact sheets on individual assets =01) The information can be pulled from =
the=20
IM.  Developing fact sheets on each asset will enable them to be packaged i=
n=20
any combination-- depending on the ultimate transaction.=20

? Vision piece=01*The existing white paper on company strategy would be rev=
ised=20
to  explain the rationale behind the strategy, future expectations for the=
=20
region, and intentions regarding employees and customers.

? Press kit shell:
*Press release =01) can be drafted with blanks for key details=20
*Fact sheet on deal (template) =01) assets involved; background on buyer/se=
ller;=20
costs and sales terms; employees; customer base; revenue
*Asset fact sheets (see above)
*Vision (see above)
*Information buyer
*Information on Enron/ESA

? Q&A =01) There are certain questions that will need to be answered regard=
less=20
of the situation; a master set of Q&A can be developed and then be broken u=
p=20
and used as needed depending upon situation and audience.=20

Employee Issues
What happens to employees?
Will employees lose their jobs?  If so, how many?
What if I don=01,t want to work under the new owner?
What role will Jim and Diomedes play following sale?

Customer & Business Partner Issues
How will customers be affected by transaction?
How will ESA business partners be affected?
Do business partners have any say in whether transaction should go forward?

Approval Process
Who has to approve the sale?
What is the regulatory/approval process?  How long will this take?

Enron and ESA Strategy
What happens to ESA?
What business will you be in, in South America?
Will Enron repeat this process in other parts of the world?
What happens if not all of ESA assets are sold?

Financial Implications
What is the total anticipated price for all of the assets?
How much of company=01,s holdings does this represent?
What is the impact on shareholders?
How will the money be reinvested?

I would appreciate feedback on the proposed workplan, so I can make the=20
appropriate changes and begin completing the above tasks.  Diomedes, I know=
=20
that you and Mark are super busy, but I=01,m available to meet with you at =
your=20
convenience.  It would also be extremely valuable for me to reinitiate the =
TA=20
support from Sue Garman.  I=01,ve kept her posted on developments, so she=
=01,s=20
prepared to =01&hit the ground running.=018   Lastly, Mark, with so many of=
 the=20
rollout activities involving HQ, I would like a chance to discuss how to=20
organize a team effort to accomplish the many and varied activities. =20
