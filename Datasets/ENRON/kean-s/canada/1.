		 Subject: Alberta Pool Rule Changes

Unfortunately, today in an unprecedented move the Alberta Government 
over-ruled the Power Pool on its decision yesterday not to amend the Power 
Pool Rules and exclude importers from setting pool price.  The Minister 
signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports 
from influencing the determination of the pool price.   The Power Pool has 
been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation.  Larry 
Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of 
advice not to do it from Larry.   Apparently the Premier met with 
representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the 
Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by  Enmax (the 
City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 
1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn.   

Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from 
Blakes.  The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether 
we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes 
this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our 
participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday.  The fear is that our 
conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow 
estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA.   
Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here 
(Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a 
paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government. 

Regards,

Rob
