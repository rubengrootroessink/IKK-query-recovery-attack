Subject: EES Board Presentation

Many thanks to all of you that have spent so many hours digging into the EES 
risk areas for purposes of developing a presentation for the May 2 board 
meeting.  Because the final presentation needs to be complete at least two 
weeks prior to the meeting, this week has to be the week we wrap up our work 
and develop our conclusions.  We have already started working with Rick Buy 
to develop the skeleton of a presentation draft which is attached.  As you 
can see, it is pretty basic and does not yet include much information in 
certain areas such as regulatory risk.  I also think that we need to develop 
stronger more concise conclusions in each risk area.  I would like for 
everyone to think of the one or two major points relating to EES risk in your 
area that you would want Rick to communicate to the Board.  If you could 
articulate these in brief bullet form it would be appreciated.  Also any 
suggested improvements to the draft presentation would be greatly appreciated.

To make sure that we are on track, I am getting everyone together for a 
meeting early this week.  We are scheduled for an update meeting with Rick B. 
on Wed . at 2:00 so I would like to have our meeting prior to that.   Thanks 
again for your efforts!     

           Rick C.
