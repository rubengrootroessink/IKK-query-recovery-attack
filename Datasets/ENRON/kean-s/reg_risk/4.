The Regulatory Risk Assessment Working Group Agenda:

1.     Brief recap of meetings held in Canada and England
         
     - Review the trends discovered from the first phase of risk assessment, 
primarily the lack of a standardized due diligence process for Enron's 
businesses

2.     Focus on development of formal due diligence procedures for various 
business segments - i.e. Generation, Distribution, possibly transmission and 
retail

     - Formation of  teams to tackle each of the segments separately

3.     Wrap up the second phase of regulatory risk assessment
