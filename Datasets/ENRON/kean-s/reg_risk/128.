Subject:	Needed ASAP!!!!
Importance:	High

NEEDED....from November 2000 to present, all major accomplishments and transactions e.g., advocacy, risk mitigation, transaction support & creation and your best attempts to value these items are needed ASAP to myself, Jim Steffes & Steve Kean.  Also, please include any current efforts you are working on that may result in value created or loss of value avoided.

Thanks
