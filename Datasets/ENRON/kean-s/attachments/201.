Subject: Joskow Paper on Industry Restructuring



Here's Paul Joskow's paper from the AEI/Brookings conference today.  Given
his stature in the industry, I think the quote on page 104 may be useful.

"I do not believe that in the long run the U.S. electric power sector can
exist and prosper with a checkerboard of competitive and non-competitive
states taking power from the same transmission networks, or even with a
large number of competitive states which have adopted a wide array of
different rules and institutions for wholesale and retail competition."

Cheers.
