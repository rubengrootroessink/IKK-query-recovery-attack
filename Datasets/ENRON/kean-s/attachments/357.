Linda - (I hope this is the one in Washington DC) and Joe - the Argentine=
=20
goverment has carrried this issue on for to long.  Basically - the regulato=
r=20
is violating the terms of our license - because it is not convenient for th=
e=20
government to follow our license.  It is a case of the Government trying to=
=20
fix its inflation problems on the backs of the regulated companies and in t=
he=20
process there are doing further damage to the economy.  =20

 Impact on TGS is about $58mm of revenue and we have ceased to authorize ne=
w=20
investments.   From my perspective we have clear BIT case - but I prefer to=
=20
wait until we have run out of more conventional options.  Also the BIT=20
arbirtration on Stamp Tax is starting and I I don't want to have two cases=
=20
going at the same time if I can avoid it..  =20

Eduardo and I will be working with US embassy in Argentina - they have=20
indicated that push from Washington DC would help termendously.  I will get=
=20
the the memo in the first attachment translated and send to you - hopefully=
=20
on monday.   Aslo Eduardo will be putting together some more info on TGS=20
specific impact.  As the meeting between Colin Powell and Argentine=20
ambassador is on Feb 6 - thought it would be good to get you guys up to spe=

and as I think this is going to be a bit of a drawn out process - would lik=

your assistance in putting together plan for getting the Argentine governme=

to correct this mistake.

I would like to arrange a call on Wednesday afternoon - the 31st to discuss=

Can you please let me know who should be invited from the DC office.

Pete:

Last Wednesday, January 24, I held a meeting at the US Embassy with Jim=20
Wilson  - Counselor for Commercial Matters - and Douglas Climan - Counselor=
=20
for Economic Affairs.
 =20
I believe that the meeting was highly positive since it gave the chance to=
=20
let them know the PPI issue in detail, to make them clear some points of th=
e=20
process and of the PPI working and to provide them with information about t=
he=20
topic.

They showed themselves very interested in taking action to help us with the=
=20
National Government and to such end we have agreed the following:
 =20
a. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, the Argentine Foreign Affairs Minister,=
=20
will meet with Collin Powell in Washington  next February 6. They will try =
to=20
include this subject in the agenda, at least to cover it generally.
b. They will send to Washington the information that I gave to them in orde=
r=20
to be submitted to the Argentine Ambassador in US by an Enron officer=20
there.    =20
c. They will clearly speak about this issue at the regular meetings that th=
ey=20
hold at the Economy Ministry (especially with Machinea) where they are aske=
d=20
cooperation for attracting American investments to Argentina.
d. They will transmit this subject to the American Ambassador in Argentina=
=20
and a meeting will be agreed if necessary.
e. We will be in continuous contact to keep them informed about the process=
=20
and they will inform us about the actions that they may be taking.=20

They mentioned, among other subjects, the meeting that would be held that=
=20
afternoon between F. Mezzadri (CMS=01, President and TGS=01,shareholder) an=
d=20
Ambassador Welch. Although the topic of the meeting was Stamp Tax they also=
=20
will include the PPI issue.

Finally, they mentioned that the US Embassy regularly organizes a meeting=
=20
during the first week of April with American companies holding investments =
in=20
Argentina, members of the commercial areas of the Embassy and officers comi=
ng=20
from US. They recommended us to participate at such meeting (also with=20
someone from Enron in US) since that is a good opportunity for them to know=
=20
the commercial matters with the Government.

At the end of the meeting, Climan mentioned that it would be interesting to=
=20
organize a visit of Ambassador Welch to TGS facilities in the interior of t=
he=20
country. For that purpose, we have agreed that I would prepare a tentative=
=20
trip program to visit not only some facilities but also some working areas=
=20
where expansion works are being performed. In principle, they let us to=20
propose the date and they also mentioned the possibility of including in th=
e=20
trip some visit to a Provincial Governor. I am working on that and I will=
=20
send you a draft of the program as soon as I have it.  I think that if this=
=20
visit is carried out it would be good to do it with Enron and Perez Companc=
=01,s=20
officers.

 Attached you will find the information that I gave to Doug and Jim for you=
=20
send it to Washington.

Regards
Eduardo

Thanks Mike.  Jim and I spoke with Eduardo for an hour this afternoon --  h=
e
helped answer some of the remaining questions we had about the politics
behind the Defensor del Pueblo action.  We'll brief the Ambassador tomorrow
and will also meet with CMS on the issue.

You may want to have Joe Hillings raise the PPI-indexing issue with
Argentine Amb Gonzalez in D.C. - it helps to have the Foreign Ministry here
get parallel hits from our embassy and from theirs.  Also note that ForMin
Giavarini will meet with new SecState Powell in Washington February
6....while their conversation will doubtlessly be broad-ranging, we'll make
sure this issue gets into the Secretary's briefing memo.

Best,  Doug

 Eduardo Quintana is with Wilson at 3pm today. You may wish to sit
in.
 Eduardo is new to the embassy I have told him we would provide him
with a
 roster of who does what. Could you send that to me.

 Regards
