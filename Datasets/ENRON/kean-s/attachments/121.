***   CONFIDENTIAL   ***

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

The original group had 3 meetings between January and March.  The initial 
group consisted of:   
One of our initial directions was to form subgroups with specific tasks, and 
to give people across different parts of the organization a chance to work 
together.  This was organized as: 

Beginning in April, a new subgroup was formed of individuals that had 
individual responsibility for areas where EES might be active 
internationally, and consisted of:  
Rob Hemstock  (Non USA North America)
Amr Ibrahim  (Caribbean)
Luiz Maurer  (South America)
Thane Twiggs  (India)
Mike Grimes (Pacific Rim)
Kyran Hanks (Europe)
Harry Kingerski (USA)

The new subgroup, in effect, replaced the larger group and we have worked 
together through the year as specific, focused needs arose.  I have not 
reconvened the larger group for these two specific reasons:
1) it was clear that, to the extent there were EES international needs, they 
were already being met by Mark Schroeder in Europe and Luiz Maurer in Brazil 
(Scott Porter of EES, in Brazil, made it quite clear he was very happy with 
Luiz.)
2) International EES could not articulate a need from Regulatory Affairs that 
was not being met.  Mark Mueller from EES was very helpful in our initial 
discussions but he said EES was several months away from any viable business 
strategy or regulatory needs.  We were a group "in search of a client". 

Individuals in the (April) subgroup have been in touch with regional 
commercial counterparts and we talk as needed.


What did the group accomplish?


Specific products that were developed and shared with the group:

1) A presentation put together by Gloria Ogenyi on regulatory "Lessons 
Learned" that can have commercial value, and it includes slides used from 
some commercial presentations from EES USA.      
2)  A table put together by Kyran Hanks that shows regulatory attributes by 
country for Europe.    

3) Information sharing.  It was a good way for people across the organization 
and on different continents to get to know one another.  The contacts made 
were valuable.  (Personally, I know it was valuable for me to say in a couple 
of customer presentations, that Enron is the only retailer where I could, 
when faced with a problem, instantly have people on the phone with experience 
from 5 different continents who could help solve the problem.)


Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

No, not the larger working group.  I think it is more effective to organize 
activity around specific needs and bring people together to perform the 
function as needed.  It is hard and was hard to keep everybody's attention if 
there is no specific task.


Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

See above.


Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1. 

Kyran Hanks, Mike Dahlke,  and  Amr Ibrahim were especially helpful in this 
process.  I reviewed Amr in the PEP.  We had high attendance and good 
participation from the rest of the team.  Gloria Ogenyi came in and did a 
good job assembling materials.
