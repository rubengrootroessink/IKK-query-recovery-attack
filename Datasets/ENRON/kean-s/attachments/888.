Good morning,
? Yesterday, Coram, a QF, said that it signed a petition to file involuntary 
bankruptcy against Southern California Edison. Reportedly, the petition is 
under review by five other renewable QFs.  Apparently, certain gas-fired QFs 
are now forming a second petitioner group.
? We believe that it should be fairly easy for Coram to collect the two other 
signatures needed to make a petition valid. Whether the petition will 
actually be filed is unclear since the QFs may only be attempting to expedite 
a resolution for the utilities and themselves.
? On Wednesday, a federal court allowed Caithness, another QF, to place a 
lien on an Edison asset, thus giving it a secured claim effective in 90 days. 
Edison is filing an appeal and an automatic stay of decision.
? The Caithness decision may prompt Edison's other unsecured creditors to 
seek similar motions. As we previously indicated, we believe that QFs pose 
the greatest risk of filing involuntary bankruptcy against the utilities 
because of their dire financial situation.
? Although Governor Davis and the utilities purportedly continue to negotiate 
a recovery plan, there is no assurance of legislative cooperation. In 
addition, we expect news of the petition to cause near-term weakness in the 
utilities' stocks. Therefore, we recommend that investors avoid EIX ($13.59, 
Hold) and PCG ($12.92, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and 
volatility.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
