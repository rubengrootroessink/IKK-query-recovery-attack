Hi Steve,

I am not sure if you remember meeting me when you were in India several 
months back but I am a manager with Global Finance dedicated to the India 
team. I received the following resume from a very good, old friend of mine 
and thought you might be able to channel it in the right direction. I only 
have very positive things to say about Bill; I hope you find that his skills 
and backgrounds are of use to Enron and consider talking to him. I am in 
India now but am available should you have any questions him.
Thank you for your consideration.

Hey Andrea

I spent some time exploring Enron's website and am very intrigued by your
company's extensive philanthropic programs and would be very interested
in speaking with anyone you might think would be appropriate.  I've
attached my resume just in case.

Of course, absolutely no pressure on you.

Any chance that you'll be in the bay area anytime soon?

Cheers.

Bill
