Stan, Shelley and Jeff:

    Attached is a draft of the announcement, agenda and two form letters.
January 26 is the date and we hope to have this announcement this week,
barring any problems that arise at the last minute.  Let me know if you have
any changes you would like made.  Jim and Bill have reviewed the announcement
and the agenda.

     We are putting together the list of associations and special invitees,
in addition, of course, to all GISB members.  So far the list includes the
AGA, APGA, APPA, EPRI, EPSI, NERC, NARUC Gas and Electric Committees, CUBR,
EEI, IPPA, NGSA, UIG, Governors' Association, Energy Subcommittee, NASUCA.
If you can think of any more let me know.

    On corporations -- we are targeting big utilities that are not GISB
members -- Southern, the Electric side of Cinergy, NYSEG, etc.  If you can
think of any others there, also let me know.

        Best Regards, Rae
