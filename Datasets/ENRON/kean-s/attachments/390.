Jim, Rick and Steve:

This is for tomorrow morning's meeting. To give us a focus for the
discussions I thought it would be best if we went through this fairly
quickly (maybe 45-50 minutes) as a presentation first.

Given the complexity of a full market design, this is obviously only an
overview. But our first priority is to present the ideas and develop the
logic behind the proposals.

See you tomorrow.


Seabron
