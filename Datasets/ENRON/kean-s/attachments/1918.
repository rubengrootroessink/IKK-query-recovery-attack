Stan and Steve,

Thanks again for serving as Chairs for the upcoming PRC meetings.  I've 
talked with Terry and Ted, and we suggest that you use the following points 
to open each of the meetings.  If you have questions please feel free to 
contact any of us.  I've also attached an updated set of Ground Rules to 
replace in your binder.

Thanks,
Billy
