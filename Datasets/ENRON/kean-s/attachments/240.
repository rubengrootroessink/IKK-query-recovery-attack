Rick - 

Attached are the revised budget spreadsheets.  I have a hard copy for your 
review and file which I will bring over in a minute.  Do you want the cost 
center owners to see a copy of the spreadsheets for each group or do you want 
the cost centers to get the final sheets for their group only?

Eric
