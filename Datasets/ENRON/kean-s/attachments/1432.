Subject: can you get this to Ken Lay in Davos

Rosalee - attached are some talking points prepared by our German gas 
origination team.  They would like to have these forwarded to Ken in Davos, 
where the person we would like Ken to speak with is also in attendance.  That 
is Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) of 
Germany.  The FCO is about to dismiss a complaint we filed, on rather 
specious procedural grounds.  We regard this as an important case, and if Ken 
could have word with Boge about how important we regard this case, it would 
help.   thanks  mcs
