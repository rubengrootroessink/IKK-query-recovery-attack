Jim and Margaret:

Attached you will find the latest version of the transition document.  It 
incoprporates most of the suggestions you made as well as the agreements we 
camr to on my last visit to HOU.

Margaret,  as you will see I need you help with a couple of pages.

Jim, I need you to help me get some people to participate in the Addressing 
Specific Issues chapter.

I hope you find it useful.


Best,

Ricardo
