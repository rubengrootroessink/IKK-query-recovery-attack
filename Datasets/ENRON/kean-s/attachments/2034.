Dear Ken,

Now that the election is over (finally!),  I am turning to exploring future 
prospects after my current post as Deputy Secretary and COO of the Department 
of Energy.   I am following up your offer the last time we met to call you 
when I was next thinking about making a job change.   The last time, when I 
moved to DOE from OMB in the White House, we were trying to meet but had just 
been unable to match our schedules.

I am from California, and am most interested in going back to help some 
business in the energy sector carry out an effective strategic approach to 
that market during this difficult period.  I believe the combination of my 
political and business experience can be very helpful in these times.

I am attaching a copy of my resume, and look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely, TJ
