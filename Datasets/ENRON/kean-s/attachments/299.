Attached are the minutes of the last conference call, along with two items on 
transmission congestion pricing - the presentation Dan Allegretti briefed us 
on, and a list of questions and answers about flowgate transmission pricing, 
for background.

Please send me any agenda items you'd like to cover in the next meeting by 
Monday, Oct. 2.
