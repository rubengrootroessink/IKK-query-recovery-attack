Here is the electronic version of the PGE/Sierra answer to the TANC/SMUD 
protest which was filed on Monday.   Unfortunately, everyone was not included 
on the Skadden circulation list to review the drafts of the answer, so to 
rectify this problem, I will forward all future PGE/Sierra merger related 
emails to everyone on this email as I receive them.

We are trying to set up a conference call with the LeBoeuf attorneys (FERC 
and SEC) for a timing update, and we will call around to check everyone's 
availability within the next couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  

Sarah
