Mark - Project Margaux is the project that involves our project in Turkey.  
Thought this DASH would be useful to you, and as it may bear on what you are 
tyring to accomplish.  I am still awaiting answers to my questions about 
regulatory approvals for asset sales/transfers in Turkey, and will provide 
the info to you when I have it.   mcs
