The newly acquired gathering assets will be operated by employees of NBP 
Services Corp., whereas Northern Border Pipeline is operated by Northern 
Plains employees.  There will be no common officers between NBP Services and 
Northern Plains and no shared employees.  Thus, NBP Services employees as 
operator of non-jurisdictional assets will not be subject to the marketing 
affiliate rules and will be free to work in a complementary work relationship 
with ENA.

The press release makes it sound like Northern Border will operate both the 
jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional assets.  You may want to make it clear 
that Northern Border Pipeline is operated by Northern Plains.

Eric - I think the release looks fine.

Shelley -- I take it there are no affiliate issues here (or they have been 
fully vetted)?
