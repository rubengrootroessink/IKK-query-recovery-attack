Here are five articles pertaining to Enron and the offer we made in San 
Diego. I am looking for others.

Karen Denne remarks in the San Diego Union Tribune that Enron has offered 
fixed price contracts and that Enron customers have not been effected by this 
price spike. July 25, 2000



The article below states that Enron has put an offer for energy at 5.5 
cents/KWh on the table, and others are
expected to provide a variety of possible deals. July 16, 2000 San Diego 
Union Tribune (SDUT)



Enron has already made one offer, but the
price is too high and the terms are too long. July 11, 2000 SDUT



The local utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, denied reports yesterday that it 
would soon reach an agreement with Enron Corp. on a deal that would lock
in power rates for years for a large segment of its customer base... The 
initial offer from Enron was to provide power for four years at 5.5
cents per kilowatt, according to Peace, who emphasized he hoped SDG&E would 
receive competing bids from other companies.
Hoge said Enron's track record and the nature of long-term power contracts 
made her skeptical that such a deal could save San Diego money.
"With fixed contracts, you always end up paying more than you should on the 
other end," she said. "And Enron always has a way to make these contracts
work for them." July 11, 2000 SDUT



Concerning Enron ..."This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people," 
said Harvey
Rosenfield, who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to overturn
deregulation. "They jack up rates over 200 percent -- then they offer you a
deal at a 50 percent hike.

"I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people of San
Diego at the mercy of Enron."

Enron is offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per 
kilowatt hour,
according to Peace. The price would be about 50 percent less than current 
costs, but more than 50 percent above rates paid as recently as this
spring.
