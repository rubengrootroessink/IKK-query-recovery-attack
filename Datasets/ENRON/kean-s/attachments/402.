Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's 
request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good 
protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's 
filing once I receive them later today.  

Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require 
"ultimate" "Valid" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control 
areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed 
interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's 
agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings.
