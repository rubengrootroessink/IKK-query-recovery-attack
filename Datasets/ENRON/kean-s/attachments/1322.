Ladies and Gentlemen:

First of all, thanks to all who were able to attend our first meeting last 
week.  My apologies for the short notice and inconvenient scheduling - it was 
the best we could do based on travel schedules and time-zones.

Attached is a presentation of the results of our first meeting.  Please take 
a look at it and thank about how we can move from the conceptual to the 
practical as painlessly as possible.

Schedule permitting, I would suggest we meet next week to see where we go 
from here.

Thanks,

George
