Steve and Cindy,

 Our team has created the attached document containing statistics from both 
Career Exchanges in January and February.  Per Sarah Davis, I am forwarding 
this document for your review.  As well as displaying a sincere concern for 
our employees well being, The Career Exchange also allows other organizations 
the opportunity to acquire Enron talent.  In turn, new opportunities will 
arise with Enron Alumni at other organizations.  In the event you should have 
any questions concerning this information, please call one of the following 
members of the Global Resource Management team:

Sarah Davis  3-5328
