DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T=
aub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray=
 Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric=
ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a=
 misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur=
chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da=
vis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on=
 the office's press list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state p=
ower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract=
s. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i=
nvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed=
 through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w=
hich are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of=
 the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t=
he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  Accord=
ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity =
for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li=
ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14=
9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura=
te.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me=
gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe=
rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a=
ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on=
 the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma=
rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str=
ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis=
lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft=
er they are signed.  =09

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure=20
July 6, 2001=20
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion o=
f worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported=
 by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said=
 Thursday.=20
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, com=
pared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis.=20
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive anothe=
r increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely=
 would require some future increase.=20
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixe=
d prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range fr=
om a few months to 20 years.=20
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the=
 fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contrac=
ts would decline over time.=20
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers.=20
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, l=
ong-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably eit=
her average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The Util=
ity Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contr=
acts are very convoluted and complex."=20
