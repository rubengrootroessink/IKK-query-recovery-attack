Hi Steve, 

For some awful reason, this did not make it to you on Friday afternoon when I 
sent it.  Hopefully it finds you this time! 

I received your agenda changes, but I would appreciate you looking over the 
steering committee when you have a chance. 

Thanks for your time, MSA

Hi Steve, 

I have attached the steering committee and agenda for review. Mark has made 
significant changes to both documents, so your input would be appreciated. 
Please narrow the steering committee list down to around 30.  For the agenda, 
please focus on content and not timing (since the dates changed per our 
conversation).

Your feedback is needed as soon as possible.  Our goal is to send invitations 
to speakers and steering committee members within the next week.  

Thank you for your time! Have a good weekend, Margaret
