Attached are three versions of standby statements on our Blockbuster contract 
and sets of questions and answers, albeit with many missing answers.  NONE OF 
THESE IS A NEWS RELEASE TO PROACTIVELY ISSUE.  THEY ARE TO USE ONLY IF 
ASKED.  The statements are:

1. For use immediately, should someone ask about contract status. It is 
basically a "discussions are confidential" statement.

2. If word of our renegotiations is too broadly leaked, we may have to 
consider a different statement so we're not put on the defensive.

3. If and when we cancel the contract.  It would be preferable to offer a 
joint, amiable statement with BB so we don't go to war in the media, but 
this  statement assumes that we'd have our own.

We need to deal with versions 1 and 2 shortly since Blockbuster continues to 
make comments (like at the Kagan conference this week, where Antioco said we 
won't extend the trial due to small movie selection.)

And we need to think about responses to the types of questions that we expect 
to receive.  Please send me your comments by early next week.
