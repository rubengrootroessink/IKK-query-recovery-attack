preparing Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding their proposed regulations for 
the Houston Non-attainment area. Enron will be supporting the Business

Enron Day of Caring - Russell Tucker provided employee safety oversight 
during the Enron Day of Caring activities at the Depelchan Children's Center. 
Safety concerns encountered ranged from the intended use of Benzene 
containing materials without proper personal protective equipment to 
inhalation, skin contact and fire hazards in handling flammable solvents. 
Safety supplies were ordered and distributed prior to the start of the 
projects for the hazards known to exist.

Enron Ergo Program Evaluation - Russell Tucker reports 50% of the 3 AC Enron 
proposed Ergo Program evaluations are complete with some program bugs being 
reported and already being addressed by the software development team. All 
exit interviews report very positive on the program itself and highly 
recommend it. Linda Adels continues to work with EDS to get the CBT program 
installed and the workstation assessment available on the Internet for the 
Enron Building participants. EDS is requiring a security request be made for 
each person to load  the CD-ROM's and updating of the Internet browser on all 
the involved computers. None of these problems would be present with these 
programs installed and run from the Enron Intranet, which is the intended 
method should the program be adopted for global use.

preparing an Environmental Notice on the Corps of Engineers revisions to the

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb  reports that OPIC release of funding for Cuiaba I is 
now the end of September.  This means that work on the compressor stations 
will not begin in earnest until then.  I expect to view proposed and 
alternate compressor station locations during next visit to area now expected 
to be in late October.  Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S) in Bolivia is providing 
valuable assistance in coordinating trip plans.

BMPs - Joe Kolb is waiting for a response from Norm Spalding (EE&CC) whom 
Jerry Martin assigned the proposed pipeline BMPs for review.  A message has 
been left with Norm.  A response was promised by the end of last week.   Bill 
Osborne (GPG) received feedback from Steenberg and Shafer in GPG.  All 
comments helpful and none propose significant changes to document.  Bill 
Osborne has sent BMPs to others within GPG.  GPG reorg may delay responses.

person to review fiber optic BMPs.  The consultant is proceeding with work on 
the electric transmission and fiber optic BMPs.  Wilson will be sent draft as 
soon as it is received.

Conservancy, Habitat for Animals, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation 
International and the NRDC.  Many recognized and applauded Enron for its 
first appearance and partication.  There may be potential interest in working 
with WRI on future projects.

Environmental Policy Center - We have subscribed to a trial subscription of  
EPC's environmental and safety regulatory and legislative monitoring service 
for Brazil and U.K. and have received the first electronic report.  We are 
now awaiting feedback from regional reviewers to determine if there is 
anything we would like to enhance or change prior to signing an agreement for 
continued and expanded service.  This service will allow the Reg/Leg, 
Environmental Strategies, and regional EHS personnel to track pending and 
proposed legislation in other countries.
