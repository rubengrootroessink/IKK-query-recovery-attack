Well, it looks like we are actually announcing the Blockbuster deal next 
Wednesday!  Blockbuster has agreed to most of the language but the stuff in 
bold (or nonbold in the case of the headline) has not been agreed to.  Please 
take a look, but do not circulate until Monday with others--we are missing a 
few pieces and there could be more changes.  Wanted you to see how it is 
shaping up.

Ken Lay helped get a number of issues resolved this week by accompanying 
Blockbuster to various partner and studio meetings and we really appreciate 
it.  He is therefore coming for the webcast taping on Tuesday and the dinner 
we are hosting for our partners even if Blockbuster and Enron are the only 
two to participate.

Will keep you posted.  Mark, thanks for the reminder on managing expectations 
about how this goes over.  When I reminded Hirko and Rice that we make this 
announcement as great as possible, but the market decides if they like it and 
cover it, they promised not to fire me next week because of the Blockbuster 
deal.
