This draft looks ok to me.  Just to make sure the logic is being transmitted 
to the authors of the communiques, we obvioiusly need to get a pop for the 
investment community from selling assets and increasing return on equity.  At 
the same time we need to communicate to partners, customers and regulators 
that Enron is still there, which is the basis for some of our contracts and 
concessions.  This dual benefit is the main conceptual value in the summer 
deal, if it is done, and needs to guide our communication strategy which will 
inevitably involve the same message going to investors as goes to our 
counterparts in the markets in question.
