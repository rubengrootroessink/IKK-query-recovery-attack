Steve/Cindy;

David O. and I met with Dave Delainey yesterday to discuss PRC-- as an 
initial step before we convene the committee (hopefully next week).  Here is 
the gist of that discussion:
? Committee: Add Philippe Bibi to the committee (Delainey was to call 
Skilling on that)
? Peer Groups: He's on board with the Peer Group changes (4 to 3) once 
approved by the Policy Committee
? Ratings and Cluster Descriptors: Agrees in principal with our suggestion to 
use different scales for the 360 rating and the meeting ratings.  He'd like 
the meeting rating scale to be numbers vs. adjective descriptors and would 
like to use a 1- 5 cluster scale vs. the present 6 clusters.  Item for agenda 
for Committee.
? Preferred distribution:  PD should be set by the policy committee.  Item 
for agenda for committee.
? Eligibility for PRC- new hires with less than 6 months tenure will not be 
on the slate for discussion at PRC meetings.  They will, however, get 
feedback via the PEP system.  Bonuses for new hires less than 6 mos. will be 
at the discretion of the BU.  Item for agenda for committee.
? Full disclosure of rating results - Delainey wants to discuss this with the 
Committee for feedback.
? PRC Coverage:  Non-exempt employees to be reviewed in meeting on a 1-3 
scale with no preferred distro applied.
? Employee self eval:  Form to be revised and to include employee 
accomplishments.  We'll provide a link in the emp. self eval  form to permit 
the emp. the option to provide feedback on supervisor.
? Ensure diverse PRC committee representation:   Lists of proposed PRC 
committee members to be sent to Michelle Cash's office for review.  Item for 
Committee agenda.
? Rostering:   Delainey wants to discuss  numerical ranking of employees with 
the Committee.
