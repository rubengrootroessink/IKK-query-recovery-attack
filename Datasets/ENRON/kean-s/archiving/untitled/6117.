=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.
