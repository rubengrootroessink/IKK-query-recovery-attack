Guys, a quick follow up on action items:
 CALIFORNIA:
 a) UC/CSU - send notice of default to them to start the clock ticking on the 
mediation and arbitration this will also give us time to complete the 
remaining transfer of the existing accounts on SCE - MS/VS - ASAP;
 b) '02 California positions - need update from regulatory giving us a view 
of the following:
    - possible market structure (ie) probability of direct access or forced 
direct access for our customers where we would be required to deliver market 
priced power to fulfull our requirements in a post AB 1890 world?; - JS - ASAP
    - if it is likely that these customers will be left on tariff because of 
a lack of direct access or that we can elect to leave them on a tariff what 
are the likely tariff structures ( and their components) to replace AB 
1890?;  - JS - ASAP
    - given above what are the likely tariff increases expected; - JS - ASAP
     - and what are we currently doing to perfect our lien (regulatory) and 
ultimately legally on the collection of the negative CTC from the utilities - 
JS/VS - next week.
 Ultimately, we want to make a call on what we do with these MWhrs early next 
week.
 c) position reports - need a full WSCC energy, scalar, capacity,

pricing, structure and profitability parameters necessary to continue to take
