Steve the attached and two other e-mails to follow contain the most recent
draft of the NoCal IM. The SoCal IM should have a revised draft out
tomorrow.
 We are working with local counsel to develop a summary of the
regulatory framework affecting each asset and are having some difficulty
with response time. Does anyone in your group have an existing summary of
the regulatory framework in any of our target jurisdictions? Thanks Joe

Attached is the first of several pieces of the NoCal second draft.  The
numbers
attached are from the previous draft and do not represent our most recent
model
runs.  We spent all of Friday, Saturday and part of Sunday reviewing numbers
and
are still updating and finalizing models as well as matching facts and
figures
presented in the text to those assumed in the models.  We are going to spend
the
first half of this week finishing (hopefully) the modelling process and
putting
together MD&A's for each investment.

This draft would have gone out yesterday, but we heard from the SoCal team
in
London that the format of each asset description had changed and wanted to
at
least try to conform the NoCal draft to the altered format.  This is still
in
process at the writing of this E-Mail so that - in the interest of time - we
decided to get the text of the asset descriptions out now.  We understand
that
the new format is really just a reordering of the sections of each asset
description so conforming NoCal to SoCal should be fairly straightforward.

The intro Regional Strategy piece is being rewritten by Frank Sayre/Frank
Stabler and myself and will be circulated on Wednesday or Thursday.

In the interest of those who have to download in remote locations, I am
sending
the NoCal draft in multiple pieces.  A bound hard copy will be avilable
tomorrow
in Houston - let me know if you need one.

I would request comments back no later than Friday morning (Houston time),
so
that we can get them worked into the document over the weekend and have a
fighting chance of being ready to send the document early next week.

Many thanks,

MLM
