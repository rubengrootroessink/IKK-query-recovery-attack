This is brilliant Jane and team. I would like to build a database in DPC to 
keep this rate filing type info in. Can you in the meantime put in other 
columns of info such as number of consumers and the amount of billing for 
each group. This would give us another angle. Jane lets discuss with IT the 
set up of a database to house this and other info. Can you arrange with 
Sevina and Raghulan.

Subject: MSEB tariffs. The final Cost-of-Service model for 1999-2000

An additional complementary tariff study was developed by Amr Ibrahim and 
B.A.N. Sharma with assistance from Akshay Singh regarding the MSEB tariffs -- 
a traditional cost of service study.  This study is for 1999-2000 and 
allocates MSEB's revenue requirements to the various customer classes based 
on their cost of service.  In this case, you can see the difference between 
the allocated average cost and the actual average realisations from the 
tariffs as they are today, which gives you an idea of the basic tariff 
rationalisation that must occur to remove the unreasonable cross subsidies.  
(Note: because of the paucity of data from MSEB, the team used the same load 
factor assumptions used in the Andhra Pradesh cost of service study.)
