Subject: Friday's Enron Presentations To USG Foreign Service Officers


Steve: The session organized for the the 32 foreign services officers at 
Enron on Friday was excellent. Margaret Carson again this year put the 
program together and also made one of the presentations. The reaction from 
the visitors was gratifying. I know several of the FSOs who participated and 
no doubt many throughout the Enron system will be in contact with them 
throughout the globe over the next several years.

Joe Sutton keynoted the meeting giving attendees an overview of Enron but 
also anwered several questions. This set a high tone for the rest of the 
presentations by Mike Dahlke, Gloria Ogenyi and Margaret Carson on the 
regional issues and projects important to Enron.

Earl Tisdale did a first rate job in explaining gas control operations in the 
gas control presentation center and Kevin Presto, Christi Nicolay and Craig 
Taylor were similarly effective on our power and gas trading floors.

Enron has been involved in the PESA hosted week for FSOs with a mixture of 
DOE and DOC officers with energy assignments for the seven years the program 
has been in existence. We have received many benefits both in Washington and 
across the world from these people most of whom are headed for foreign 
assignments. Our participation produces value for many at Enron involved in 
policy, advocacy and development.

Each of these people deserve our thanks along with Carrie Robert, Courtney 
Votaw and Marge Nadasky who facilitated the sessions.

I am not certain how to let all these people know what an outstanding job 
they did for Enron on Friday but thought you would know the proper way to 
thank them for a job well done.

Joe
