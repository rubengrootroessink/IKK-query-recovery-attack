The October 16 Southern RTO filing is finally up on its website at 
www.southernco.com.  Look at the RTO documents and presentations.  They have 
filed it as a petition for declaratory order asking that the Commission 
approve their Gridco structure and rate proposal.  I did talk with FERC staff 
yesterday when the filing was not on the web and told them that Southern was 
the last to get their proposal up on the web.

I don't have what Southern filed.  I understand the filing will be on 
Southern's web page (www.southernco.com) within a couple of days.  I'm in 
Virginia at the SERC Joint Committee Meeting and won't get the filings until 
I get home Friday night.

As for an independent Board, as long as Southern owns the transmission assets 
as it does in the proposed for-profit Gridco, there is about zero possibility 
of them agreeing to have no say in the selection of the Board or in setting 
the incentive plan.  What specifically are you concerned about (the selection 
process or the incentive plan or both)?  I think we have a shot at getting 
them to consider changing the setting of the incentive plan to let the Board 
do it, as long as it is restricted such that it cannot impact the value of 
the assets.  Any thoughts?
