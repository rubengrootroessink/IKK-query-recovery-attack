Conservation bills hit snag: Provisions added to shield farmers from=20
blackouts irritate Senate leaders and delay passage of an overall package.
By Kevin Yamamura and John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 5, 2001)=20
Conservation bills designed to keep energy flowing this summer were stalled=
=20
in the Legislature on Wednesday by a dispute over whether some farmers shou=
ld=20
receive special protection from potential summer power blackouts.=20
The proposals make up a complementary, two-house conservation package that=
=20
aims to save California about 4,000 megawatts of energy. The two bills -- S=
B=20
5x by state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, and AB 29x by Assemblywoman=20
Christine Kehoe, D-San Diego -- together would cost the state $1.2 billion,=
=20
though Gov. Gray Davis may reduce that with line-item vetoes should the=20
legislation reach his desk.=20
The dozens of conservation measures include:=20
$20 million in rebates or other incentives to encourage Californians to=20
replace inefficient appliances, with priority given to low- and middle-inco=
me=20
residents.=20
An outreach program to teach schoolchildren about saving energy.=20
$14.5 million for efficient traffic signal lights.=20
Lawmakers want to give the bills to Davis before next week's scheduled spri=
ng=20
recess begins late Thursday, but the legislation remains mired in a=20
cross-house entanglement over a series of changes that the Assembly pencile=
d=20
into SB 5x on Tuesday.=20
The Assembly approved the bill Wednesday on a 74-1 vote, but the Senate=20
adjourned without resolving the dispute.=20
Assembly leaders said that unless several proposals favorable to farmers we=
re=20
included in the bill, a group of Central Valley lawmakers would have oppose=
d=20
it.=20
One proposal limits the amount of time interruptible agricultural customers=
=20
can lose energy to four hours a day or 20 hours per month. Michael Boccador=
o=20
of the Agriculture Energy Consumers Association said farmers and food=20
processors are concerned that their perishables would not be able to surviv=
e=20
beyond that amount of time.=20
The provision would affect "interruptible," customers, those who volunteer =
to=20
lose power in emergencies in exchange for lower rates.=20
Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced, a main proponent of the proposals, sa=
id=20
the state's farmers are going to be the most hurt by rolling blackouts and=
=20
high rates this summer and "are getting ready to leave the state if we don'=
t=20
take care of the problem."=20
But the late change riled Senate leaders. Senate President Pro Tem John=20
Burton, D-San Francisco, said it would shift costs from farmers to urban=20
residents and develop special programs for agricultural customers.=20
"I think the ag people were very greedy, and what they gained in this=20
amendment, they may lose in other stuff," Burton said.=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said he does not support some of the=
=20
amendments but said that they should not prevent the conservation package=
=20
from moving forward.=20
"We're trying to solve a problem," he said. "In my view, we cannot let the=
=20
perfect be the enemy of the good."=20
Davis met privately with Assembly Republicans on Wednesday for two hours an=
d=20
emerged saying he would talk about rate increases during tonight's=20
five-minute televised speech.=20
Republicans said they discussed proposals that would boost energy supply in=
=20
the state and one to allow businesses to contract on their own for energy,=
=20
which won the Democratic governor's support.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides, meanwhile, said he has lined up commitments=
=20
for $4.1 billion in loans to keep the state going for the next few months=
=20
until the sale of bonds to buy electricity. He hopes to get a total of $5=
=20
billion to $6 billion in bridge loans. The money will be used to repay the=
=20
state's general fund for what it has spent on power so far.=20
The loans, in turn, would be paid back with money from the bond sales. But=
=20
Angelides warned that, before the bonds can be sold, he needs more=20
information from Davis about what's being spent on power.=20
"We will be selling the bonds in the public marketplace and so information=
=20
must be made publicly available," he said.=20
The treasurer, who like Davis is a Democrat, said he wants to see the=20
information and the administration's long-term plan before he supports=20
selling bonds in excess of $10 billion, the initial estimate of the bond=20
sale.=20
If the bond sale is delayed, he said, the state could end up paying a highe=
r=20
interest rate on the bridge loan, which comes due Aug. 29.=20
Tim Gage, Davis' finance director, said in a news release Wednesday that it=
=20
was Angelides' bond underwriter, J.P. Morgan, who told him that more than $=
10=20
billion might be needed. Gage said Angelides is well aware that the=20
Department of Water Resources, which is buying power on behalf of the state=
,=20
has gone to great lengths to estimate how much money it needs.=20
Davis has come under fire from legislators, the media and others for not=20
disclosing more details about power purchases. The administration says that=
=20
revealing more would compromise the state's bargaining position.=20
Angelides also said that if Pacific Gas and Electric or Southern California=
=20
Edison challenges a Tuesday decision by the Public Utilities Commission=20
setting the state's share of electricity revenues, the bridge loan could be=
=20
held up.=20
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the utility is reviewing the PUC decision to se=
e=20
if all its costs of buying power will be covered.=20
The company has 10 days from Tuesday to ask for a rehearing. If PG&E decide=
s=20
not to seek a new hearing, Angelides said, he would expect to complete the=
=20
bridge loan within another week.=20
Angelides said that officials should start turning their attention from=20
paying for power to driving down the costs of electricity by enacting an=20
excess profits tax on generators or buying power plants.=20
A state Senate committee Thursday approved a vaguely defined bill to impose=
 a=20
windfall profits tax on power generators. Under the bill, the revenues rais=
ed=20
by the tax would be returned to ratepayers.=20
"It really doesn't get at the fundamental problem, which is supply," said=
=20
Martin Wilson, a lobbyist for Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., which owns=
=20
generating plants in California.=20
Wilson said the tax could actually worsen the supply problem by creating "a=
=20
major disincentive" to building power plants in California.=20

Democrats urge U.S. price controls
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau=20
(Published April 5, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- Nearly three dozen Democratic House members from California,=
=20
Oregon and Washington joined in support of legislation to impose mandatory=
=20
controls on wholesale electricity prices Thursday amid indications that the=
=20
issue is fast becoming a political powder keg.=20
The legislation was endorsed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,=
=20
who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a large contingent of West Coast=20
Democrats at an outdoor news conference. The House members denounced the Bu=
sh=20
administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for doing nothi=
ng=20
as prices zoom ever higher in a market of perpetual shortage.=20
"They are going to keep FERCing us day in and day out," said Rep. Peter=20
Defazio, D-Ore., in a word play on the acronym for the regulatory commissio=
n.=20
"If the Bush administration is frozen in inaction, congressional members wi=
ll=20
step forward and exert action," Gephardt said.=20
With the West Coast summer of power shortages fast approaching, Rep. Joe=20
Barton, the Texas Republican who heads the House Energy and Commerce energy=
=20
subcommittee, had intended to roll out an energy bill by this week.=20
But the House recesses Friday for a two-week spring break, pushing off any=
=20
House bill until late April. And Barton's spokeswoman, Samantha Jordan, sai=
d=20
it's not certain now that Barton will even introduce legislation as a resul=
t=20
of six days of hearings on the California crisis.=20
"He hasn't decided to do a bill," Jordan said. "He's still looking at=20
options."=20
Some utility and Democratic sources said the White House has quietly urged=
=20
Barton to slow down work on an energy bill because it is worried that=20
Democrats will offer the price-control legislation as an amendment.=20
With fears spreading in the Northeast that New York and possibly other stat=
es=20
could face similarly skyrocketing electricity costs as air conditioners beg=
in=20
turning on in a few weeks, the White House is said to be concerned that suc=
h=20
an amendment could squeak through Congress and force the president's hand o=
n=20
a veto.=20
Last week Barton began circulating a list of ideas for inclusion in an=20
emergency bill. Among the ideas is requiring the FERC to determine if price=
s=20
are being unreasonably jacked up by producers -- something the commission=
=20
already has decided.=20
The ideas also included starting up backup generators on federal buildings,=
=20
authorizing portable generators to be set up and run on military property,=
=20
authorizing the Defense Department to "explore connecting Navy nuclear-ship=
=20
generators to the electric grid" and firing up mothballed non-nuclear plant=
s.=20
One congressional source said the administration has begun dispatching=20
regulatory officials to federal property in California looking at any and=
=20
every suitable location for "dropping in" portable generation plants.=20

Word came from California's treasurer Wednesday that the state had secured=

Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy=

Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro, introduced a windfall-profits t=

bill Wednesday that would tax gross receipts that "significantly exceed" th=
e=20
cost of producing power.=20
It would also tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and late=
r=20
sold it at much higher rates. The rate of the tax was not specified in the=
=20
bill, and Corbett said she expects the details to be worked out later.=20
"We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap=20
enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This=20
profiteering must stop," said Corbett.=20
Senators on the Revenue and Tax Committee have also inserted similar langua=
ge=20
into a pending bill.=20
Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said he doubted a tax on a selecte=
d=20
industry would be legal. The tax would discourage generators from building=
=20
new power plants in California, he said.=20
"The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can t=
o=20
increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.=20
Windfall profits taxes do neither of these," said Williams.=20
"Clearly it would have an adverse affect on our decisions on new investment=

Davis said Wednesday he generally opposes treating profitable companies in=

I'm not saying I won't sign it."=20
For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy thei=

power from generators instead of going through the utilities.=20
A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly=
=20
bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts.=20
"That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power=

we should encourage, not discourage that."=20
The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors fo=
r=20
more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized=
=20
his handling of the energy crisis.=20
"I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve=

Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute=

State gets $4.1 billion infusion=20



Treasurer to Davis: Don't pay generators' 'ransom'
By Ed Mendel=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 5, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced an agreement for a=
=20
$4.1 billion short-term loan yesterday that would provide urgently needed=
=20
cash to begin repaying the state general fund for power purchases.=20
Angelides said the loan is needed to protect the state's credit rating and=
=20
preserve "important funding for programs such as education, public safety a=
nd=20
children's services."=20
The treasurer also sent a letter to Gov. Gray Davis warning that plans to=
=20
increase the size of a $10 billion bond, which would repay the short-term=
=20
loan and finance future power purchases, may only delay the "reality of=20
runaway energy prices."=20
Angelides urged Davis and the Legislature to send power generators a messag=
e=20
by considering a windfall profits tax or seizure of power plants that=20
utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan.=20
"These are very tough guys," Angelides said, "and you don't negotiate with=
=20
them by trying to figure out night and day how to pay their ransom. You've=
=20
got to push back on them. It's the only thing they understand."=20
The state Senate began moving a bill yesterday that would impose a windfall=
=20
profits tax on generators. The governor declined to say whether he would si=
gn=20
the bill, but Davis did say its movement was "not an entirely unpleasant=20
event."=20
"These profits are just outrageous," said Davis, echoing the treasurer's vi=
ew=20
of the generators. "They are coming at our expense directly, and the only=
=20
things companies understand is leverage."=20
The governor, who had previously briefed Democrats in both houses on his=20
handling of the electricity crisis, emerged from a two-hour meeting with=20
Assembly Republicans yesterday and announced two agreements.=20
Davis said he would make an adjustment sought by San Diego County residents=
=20
in his "20/20" conservation plan, which reduces electricity bills 20 percen=
t=20
if customers reduce their energy use 20 percent below the same summer month=
=20
in the previous year.=20
San Diego Gas and Electric ratepayers reduced their power use last summer=
=20
when the utility became the first to be deregulated and bills doubled and=
=20
tripled before rates were capped by legislation.=20
The governor also said that businesses and other large users of electricity=
=20
should be allowed to contract directly with generators for power. He said n=
ew=20
contracts were barred because the state thought it would need customers to=
=20
pay for state power purchases.=20
"Our problem is just the opposite," Davis said. "We should encourage that a=
nd=20
not discourage it."=20
Assembly Republicans said Davis told them that he will discuss the need for=
=20
an increase in electricity rates in a statewide television address schedule=
d=20
for 6:05 p.m. today.=20
The state Public Utilities Commission, controlled by Davis appointees,=20
abruptly imposed the biggest rate increase in state history on Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric and Southern California Edison customers last week. An SDG&E=
=20
rate increase is pending.=20
Davis said the PUC rate increase was "premature" and promised to give his=
=20
view after studying data. The PUC increase was more than 40 percent for=20
electricity and about 26 percent in the total bill, which includes=20
transmission and distribution costs.=20
The state began buying power for utility customers in mid-January after PG&=
E=20
and Edison were pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. Their rates were frozen=
=20
under deregulation as wholesale power costs soared, producing a debt of abo=
ut=20
$13 billion.=20
State officials are considering purchasing the utilities' transmission=20
systems as a way to provide the utilities with money to pay that debt.=20
Sempra Energy Chief Executive Stephen Baum said yesterday in New York that=
=20
the company, which owns SDG&E, wants $1.4 billion for its part of the grid,=
=20
but state officials have offered $1.2 billion. The state has not disclosed=
=20
any details about the SDG&E negotiations.=20
Edison reached a tentative agreement with the state last month to sell its=
=20
larger part of the grid for $2.76 billion.=20
So far, the state has spent about $4 billion to buy electricity. Angelides=
=20
said he has a commitment for a $4.125 billion short-term or "bridge" loan=
=20
from three lenders: J.P. Morgan, $2.5 billion; Lehman Brothers, $1 billion;=
=20
and Bear Stearns, $625 million.=20
The treasurer said he hopes to get other lenders and reach a total of $5=20
billion to $6 billion. But, Angelides said, the loan could be blocked if=20
utilities challenge a decision by the PUC on Tuesday that gives the state=
=20
$3.5 billion a year from the monthly bills collected by utilities from=20
ratepayers.=20
PG&E and Edison have said they believe the PUC action does not leave them=
=20
enough money and will drive them deeper into debt. The utilities said=20
yesterday that they have not decided whether to challenge the PUC ruling.=
=20
Angelides said the utilities have 10 days from Tuesday to challenge the PUC=
=20
decision. He said that if the PUC did not quickly resolve a challenge,=20
legislation would be needed to allow the short-term loan. If the utilities =
do=20
not challenge the PUC action, he would expect to close the short-term loan =
by=20
about April 23.=20
Angelides said the short-term loan, obtained at 5.38 percent interest, must=
=20
be repaid by Aug. 29 or it will automatically convert into a long-term loan=
=20
with an interest rate that is two percentage points higher and due Aug. 29,=
=20
2004.=20
The plan is to repay the short-term loan with the biggest municipal bond in=
=20
the history of the nation, which would be paid off by ratepayers over a doz=
en=20
years. But Angelides and the Davis administration disagree about how large=
=20
the bond should be.=20
Angelides wanted to limit the bond to $10 billion. He warned last month tha=
t=20
the money, which will also pay for upcoming electricity purchases, could be=
=20
exhausted by September if the state continues to buy power at high rates.=
=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the $3.5 billion in ratepayer revenue=20
allocated to the state would allow a bond issue of $12 billion to $14=20
billion. The Davis administration says a bond in that range is needed to=20
spread the cost of power purchases over a decade and avoid a huge rate=20
increase.=20
Angelides said a bond cannot be issued unless the Davis administration=20
publicly discloses detailed information about power purchases -- prices pai=
d=20
in the past and estimates for the future. Newspapers and Republican=20
legislators have filed lawsuits to force the release of the information.=20
The Legislature yesterday sent Davis a bill by state Sen. Dede Alpert,=20
D-Coronado, that would cap rates for businesses served by SDG&E at 6.5 cent=
s=20
per kilowatt-hour.=20
Currently, businesses whose peak demand exceeds 100 kilowatt-hours a month=
=20
pay market rates for electricity, which in some cases have soared to 37 cen=

All California hospitals exempted from blackouts=20



By John Berhman=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 5, 2001=20
All hospitals in California, regardless of their size, are now ensured that=
=20
their power will remain on during rolling blackouts, thanks to a ruling by=
=20
the state Public Utilities Commission.=20
Previously, hospitals with fewer than 100 beds were not exempt from rolling=
=20
blackouts imposed by power companies, Jan Emerson, a vice president for the=
=20
California Healthcare Association, said yesterday.=20
"The PUC had that 100-beds-or-more rule on the books since 1980, but they=
=20
came to realize that there is no magic number when you are putting people's=
=20
lives in jeopardy," Emerson said.=20
The PUC decision, made on Tuesday, "takes the decision out of the hands of=
=20
the power companies" and ensures electricity for all hospitals, she said. S=
an=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co. has been cooperative about maintaining power to=20
hospitals during rolling blackouts here, Emerson said, but the state's othe=
r=20
two companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, have=
=20
not been.=20
She said that during blackouts of March 19 and 20, about a dozen hospitals=

lost power, ranging in size from the 750-bed Long Beach Medical Center to t=
he=20
40-bed Adventist Health Redbud Community Hospital in Clear Lake, north of S=
an=20
Francisco.=20
A lawsuit filed March 22 on behalf of the hospitals, and backed by the heal=

=20
The decision was well-received in San Diego County.=20
"We had been assured by SDG&E that we would be given a high priority to kee=

Treasurer Urges Disclosure of Power Cost=20

Energy: Angelides warns that $10-billion bond issue to finance purchases=20
can't be sold otherwise. Davis, who has resisted such a move, sees a chance=
=20
of more blackouts.=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned Wednesday that he=20
cannot sell a record $10 billion in bonds to finance purchases of electrici=
ty=20
unless the state reveals the price it is paying for power--something Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis has refused to do.
?????The warning came as Davis acknowledged that his efforts to secure enou=
gh=20
electricity to meet demand could fall short, raising the possibility of mor=
e=20
blackouts.
?????"The real crunch," Davis said Wednesday, "will be in May and June and=
=20
late April"--much earlier than the usual peak in August, September and earl=
y=20
October. Angelides said he cannot secure the largest municipal bond offerin=
g=20
in American history until Wall Street can see what California is spending o=
n=20
power and what it expects to spend in the future.
?????"You can't go to the marketplace to sell $10 billion in bonds and say,=
=20
'We don't have a public plan,' " Angelides said.
?????Angelides announced that he has secured $4.1 billion in short-term=20
"bridge" financing to repay the state for power purchases until the bonds a=
re=20
issued. That deal remains clouded, in part by the utilities' resistance to=
=20
using customer payments to repay the bonds promptly.
?????The governor is scheduled to give a five-minute televised address on=
=20
energy at 6:05 tonight, expected to be carried by all Los Angeles televisio=
n=20
stations.
?????In addition to discussing the potential for more blackouts, Davis is=
=20
expected to outline his efforts to expand power production, renew his call=
=20
for Californians to cut electricity use and address the question of rate=20
hikes.
?????"I'm certainly going to share with [Californians] the progress we've=
=20
made and what we have to do together over the near term to get through this=
=20
challenge," Davis told reporters. " . . . We have to accept responsibility=
=20
for solving the problem. I'm going to lay out exactly how to do that."
?????Sensing the urgency, the Legislature spent much of Wednesday pushing=
=20
forward a $1.2-billion package of conservation bills crucial to helping=20
California escape widespread power outages during the hot season.
?????And in another move to boost summer supplies, the California Energy=20
Commission approved two "peaking plants" under a new fast-track, 21-day=20
permit process ordered by Davis.
?????Designed to produce power to meet sudden demand, such plants are a maj=
or=20
part of the governor's plan to help avert blackouts this summer, and=20
commissioners approved them unanimously. But they expressed qualms about th=
e=20
vague standards in place for the plants--one to be built near San Diego, th=
e=20
other in Palm Springs--in part because the facilities have been exempted fr=
om=20
the usual environmental reviews.
?????Most experts assume that peaking plants are pressed into service only=
=20
when demand for electricity is highest. But the facilities approved Wednesd=
ay=20
are capable of operating for as much as 85% of the time.
?????The partnership that owns the plants--a venture between Shell Oil and =
an=20
arm of engineering giant Bechtel Enterprises--is in talks to sell electrici=
ty=20
to the state for 10 years or more. But current contracts call for the sale =
of=20
500 hours of electricity for the next three years, said John Jones, a=20
representative of the partnership.
?????The company would sell the rest of its electricity on the open market,=
=20
presumably at higher prices--and not necessarily in California.
?????Suggesting that the facilities may not fit the definition of peaking=
=20
plants, outgoing Commissioner Robert Laurie called for more public disclosu=
re=20
about the implications of Davis' emergency order.
?????"They may be large; they may be small," Laurie said. "They may operate=
=20
300 hours; they may operate 8,000 hours."

?????Measures Focus on Cutting Consumption
?????The conservation bills that lawmakers addressed Wednesday--supported b=
y=20
environmentalists and the business community alike--represent the largest=
=20
such investment in history and are designed to get Californians to cut ener=
gy=20
consumption this summer.
?????The measures would provide everything from rebates for buyers of new,=
=20
efficient refrigerators to free power-saving lightbulbs for poor people. Al=
l=20
told, the measures are expected to save California roughly the amount of=20
electricity produced by eight power plants.
?????Legislators had hoped to get the bills to the governor's desk by the e=
nd=20
of this week, but some turbulence slowed the progress.
?????The trouble began Tuesday, when Assembly Democrats and Republicans fro=
m=20
agricultural areas said they would not vote for the Senate bill, SB 5X, unt=
il=20
it was amended to include programs to help agriculture. Concluding that=20
opposition might stall the bill in the lower house, Assembly leaders agreed=
=20
to the amendments, including one that protects agribusiness from blackouts.
?????That move infuriated the bill's author, Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford),=
=20
and started a war of words between the houses.
?????"What they did and the way they did it I found a little untoward," sai=
d=20
Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), calling the agricultural=20
interests "greedy."
?????In the end, the bill cleared the Assembly by a vote of 74 to 1=20
Wednesday. It now returns to the Senate. A second conservation bill, AB 29X=
=20
by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego), containing more than $400=
=20
million more for conservation programs, also awaits action there.
?????While the governor has been pushing for the bills, their price tag=20
exceeds what he has pledged to spend on conservation, and he is expected to=
=20
trim the legislation once it arrives on his desk.

?????Concerns About Depleting Treasury
?????Angelides, meanwhile, sent a letter to Davis outlining his problems in=
=20
issuing the $10 billion in bonds needed to repay the state for the power it=
=20
has been buying on the spot market. To avert mass blackouts, California mad=
e=20
its risky foray into the power-buying business in January after the state's=
=20
two largest utilities said they were nearly bankrupt and generators would n=
o=20
longer sell to them.
?????The state has been buying power at the rate of roughly $50 million a=
=20
day. A Davis-sponsored plan calls for the $10 billion in bonds to repay the=
=20
state; the bonds, in turn, would be retired by utility customers through=20
their monthly bills.
?????That plan was based on the premise that the state would be able to=20
stabilize, and eventually lower, the price of electricity by entering into=
=20
long-term contracts with power suppliers. Those lower prices have yet to=20
materialize, raising increasing questions about whether $10 billion will be=
=20
enough.
?????"I think there is no doubt that if we continue to chunk out general fu=
nd=20
money without end, what's going to happen is that we're going to deplete ou=
r=20
treasury, we're going to harm the very programs that we care most about, an=
d=20
our credit rating will come down," Angelides said.
?????The governor's finance director, Tim Gage, said such fears are=20
unfounded. Officials have planned all along to release some details on=20
California's power purchases to the Public Utilities Commission so the pane=
l=20
could determine how much money is needed to repay the bonds, he said: "I=20
would think that any information required to sell the bonds will be provide=
d.=20
. . . I don't know how specific it's going to have to be."
?????Also on Wednesday:
?????* The Assembly and Senate passed a bill placing price caps on large=20
power users in San Diego, currently the only area in California where some=
=20
are feeling the full sting of the deregulation law adopted in 1996. San Die=
go=20
was the first and only area where state regulators lifted price caps, the=
=20
expected outcome of deregulation. The result last summer was that bills=20
doubled or tripled virtually overnight.
?????The bill, SB 43 by Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), would protect medium=

the full cost of electricity on the open market. Homeowners and other small=

?????* Lawmakers in both houses announced legislation that would place a=20
windfall profits tax on power companies that sell electricity to California=
=20
at excessive prices. "It's time to gouge the gougers," said Assemblywoman=

Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), a sponsor of the Assembly proposal.
?????In the upper house, a bill (SB 1X) that would tax power producers'=20
profits at an unspecified rate and rebate the money to taxpayers cleared it=

legislation.
?????Power producers said a windfall tax would do nothing to solve the=20

House GOP Moves to Draft Plan to Give the West Summer Energy Aid=20

such possible measures as aid to ease a notorious bottleneck in the=20

?????The move came as Democratic criticism of the Bush administration's=20

?????"We can't just say, 'Let California take care of California,' " Barton=

?????Although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by Democrats=

said. "I don't think the votes are there, but I see no reason why [supporte=

?????A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a range of ide=

such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor's request;=20
increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; firing up=20

?????Some of the ideas are more practical than others. Referring to a=20
proposal to connect nuclear ships to the electricity grid, Barton said: "Do=

?????On the issue of relaxing clean air rules--another sensitive point for=

Democrats--Barton said his bill would not make permanent changes in=20
environmental requirements. Instead, it would grant governors the flexibili=

?????That, he contended, would be less harmful than one likely alternative:=

individuals and companies relying on their own generators during blackouts.=
=20
"It doesn't make a lot of sense to allow diesel generators to kick in and=

?????But Democrats said that without price controls, Republican-sponsored=

California's Electricity Woes Power Up Northwest=20

Bonneville agency's sales to Golden State keep rates low for customers up=

By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer=20

?????PORTLAND, Ore.--As California searched last summer for surplus=20
electricity to keep its air conditioners humming, the Bonneville Power=20
Administration stepped forward to help.
?????How much did the marketing agency charge for each of the 489,000=20
megawatt-hours it shipped south, power generated by the massive federal=20
hydropower dams in the Northwest?
?????If you guessed $22.39, the amount BPA charges public utilities in=20
Seattle, think again. The average price was three times that. And at the=20
height of the power-marketing frenzy, Bonneville got $750 a megawatt-hour, =
33=20
times what public utilities and private firms in the Pacific Northwest were=
=20
paying.
?????As power generators throughout the West profited from California's=20
energy appetite last year, so too did Northwest customers: BPA netted $400=
=20
million from sales to the Golden State, which helped hold down rates for=20
private electricity users here who already pay the lowest rates in the=20
nation--half of what Californians pay.
?????And major aluminum, steel and chemical companies across the=20
region--which not only pay lower rates but also have the right to purchase=
=20
certain allotments of energy produced by the federal dams--stand to pocket=
=20
$1.8 billion in the next few months by reselling or exchanging their shares=

so Bonneville can help California out of its crisis.
?????How long, Northwestern politicians wonder, can the region hold onto th=
e=20
exclusive benefits of a multibillion-dollar network of 29 federal dams on t=
he=20
Columbia and Snake rivers--legendary edifices such as Bonneville and Grand=
=20
Coulee?
?????How long, others ask, should it be able to?
?????California's two Democratic senators--Dianne Feinstein and Barbara=20
Boxer--have questioned the fairness of locking in low power rates "for a=20
select group of consumers, to the detriment of tens of millions of others=
=20
whose taxes also paid for the facilities that generate and manage that powe=
r=20
source."
?????Said David Luken of the Edison Electrical Institute, a coalition of=20
investor-owned utilities: "It would be as if California took all the revenu=
es=20
from offshore oil and used it to hold down gasoline prices in Los Angeles."
?????Critics estimate that BPA routinely sells its power to customers in th=
e=20
Northwest for about $1 billion a year less than it could earn at market=20
rates. Last year, the gap spread to about $3 billion. The BPA is the major=
=20
reason homeowners in Seattle are paying 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour for=20
electricity; Southern California Edison customers pay 10.2 cents.
?????After suspending sales to California late last year because the power=
=20
the BPA was able to generate in the face of an extreme drought was needed i=
n=20
the Northwest, the agency briefly resumed sending electricity south last=20
month--dispatching between 600 to 1,000 megawatts an hour for about eight=
=20
days between March 7 and March 21.
?????Although officials would not disclose the negotiated price, the market=
=20
rate for power then ranged from $210 to $350 a megawatt-hour.
?????Despite the windfall sales to California, however, the BPA has its=20
problems. With contracts to deliver much more power than it can generate, B=
PA=20
has said it would have to institute rate increases totaling $3 billion a ye=
ar=20
or more unless it can wean substantial blocs of customers off of federal=20
power.
?????The belt-tightening threatens the region's aluminum industry and=20
ratepayers in Washington state, Oregon, Montana and Idaho--some of whom=20
already have seen their electric bills rise 50% or more over the last few=
=20
months.
?????The looming fiscal emergency is so severe that Oregon Gov. John=20
Kitzhaber recently proposed seeking a temporary reprieve from most of BPA's=

annual $732-million debt repayment. That is money to reimburse federal=20
taxpayers, who funded the region's massive system of concrete and generator=

?????Most Northwestern political leaders are loath to miss a Treasury=20
payment--as many believe that would leave the agency ripe for plunder.
?????That is the region's greatest fear: that California's hefty=20

?????The debate over who controls BPA--and who benefits from it--promises t=

.
?????Several Northwestern legislators have proposed buying BPA back from th=
e=20
federal government in an attempt to lock in benefits for regional ratepayer=
s.=20
Congressional lawmakers last year countered with a proposal to force=20
Bonneville to sell low-cost power to private utilities in California. Some=
=20
also proposed auctioning BPA power at market rates--ending the cost-based,=
=20
regional-preference formula.
?????BPA contracts with about a dozen users--companies such as Alcoa, Kaise=
r=20
and Reynolds--that have guaranteed the energy-intensive aluminum industry=
=20
access to a fifth of Bonneville's power at rates lower than those paid by=
=20
other customers have come under particular scrutiny.
?????The contracts are so lucrative that Kaiser is expected to earn up to=
=20
$500 million this year by shutting down its factories and remarketing its B=
PA=20
power allocation.
?????BPA cites the aluminum industry's value as a reliable, steady-load=20
buyer--as opposed to residential utilities, whose fluctuating loads are=20
harder to serve.
?????But Seattle energy analyst Kevin Bell calls the industry contracts "an=
=20
incredibly bad deal." Unable to generate enough power to meet its=20
commitments, the BPA has been forced to buy power on the open market at 40=
=20
cents a kilowatt-hour, supply it to firms such as Kaiser for 2 cents, and=
=20
watch Kaiser sell it again for 40 cents.
?????It is, in fact, only the recently deregulated electricity market that=
=20
has made BPA power an attractive deal. In the mid-1990s, clients were=20
flocking away from Bonneville to cheaper generators. Aluminum companies at=
=20
the time agreed to prices that were higher than what was available elsewher=
e,=20
gambling that the market price would go up.
?????"If we're going to talk about why Bonneville has preferential rates in=
=20
the Northwest, shouldn't we also talk about why California has preferential=
=20
rates for federal power in California?" said acting BPA administrator Steve=
=20
Wright. "Federal policy is, in general, the indigenous electrical power=20
resources in a region are dedicated to the loads in that region. The power=
=20
from Hoover Dam goes to the people in the Southwest. The Central Valley=20
Project goes to people in Northern California."
?????Bonneville for years has enjoyed a mutually beneficial power exchange=
=20
with California. Although the agency often profits from surplus power sales=
=20
to California, the majority of the power it has sent south over the years h=
as=20
been either at low, long-term rates to such cities as Burbank, Glendale and=
=20
Pasadena, or as part of an exchange program in which California returns twi=
ce=20
as much as it borrows.
?????And while Bonneville ratepayers profited from the brief period of=20
sky-high wholesale power rates last summer, its sales represented less than=
=20
1% of the California power market and probably had the effect of lowering,=
=20
not raising, overall market rates, BPA officials said.
?????Indeed, Bonneville often sold power to California at less than its own=
=20
cost-based rates during the first two years of deregulation after 1998.
?????And Northwestern legislators point out that the hydropower dams, for a=
ll=20
their advantages, have come at considerable cost to the region: Two wild=20
rivers now are throttled. The price for trying to bring back endangered=20
salmon has reached nearly $4 billion so far, most of it borne by BPA=20
ratepayers.
?????The question of sharing the hydropower bonanza outside the Northwest=
=20
never came up until the 1960s--with the construction of two major power=20
arteries linking Bonneville's transmission grid with California. The=20
846-mile-long link between Celio, Ore., and Sylmar is the world's biggest=
=20
direct current power line.
?????Before agreeing to the transmission links, Northwestern politicians=20
insisted on a "regional preference" for BPA power, giving the Northwestern=

?????It is no different today.
?????"Unless we control the destiny of Bonneville, we're not going to contr=

Until this week, most Democrats simply scratched their heads over talk abou=
t=20
who might be crazy enough to launch a primary challenge to Gov. Gray Davis =
in=20
2002.=20
After all, the Democratic governor has amassed $26 million in campaign cash=
,=20
had 60 percent approval ratings and was being talked about as a guy on the=
=20
2004 Democratic presidential list.=20
That was before the phrases "rolling blackout" and "Stage 3 alert" came int=
o=20
the California lexicon.=20
Davis again found himself on the defensive last weekend over the energy=20
crisis -- but it was in front of a home crowd of Democrats gathered at the=
=20
state party convention. Democratic Controller Kathleen Connell opened fire =
on=20
the governor, urging him to get off the dime and stop blaming the GOP for t=
he=20
power crunch.=20
Meanwhile, grumbling among the party faithful was rampant -- the result of=
=20
his failure to cultivate relations with Democratic legislators and grassroo=
ts=20
activists alike, some said.=20
So, in the semidarkened Anaheim arena where a Stage 2 alert was in effect,=
=20
the Demo buzz turned to what might happen in the event the governor's polls=
=20
tank, the lights continue to flicker -- and the pressure is on to throw him=
=20
over the side and save themselves.=20
It's all just talk -- but here are some of the names being floated as=20
possible opponents:=20
-- State Treasurer Phil Angelides: Angelides, a strong supporter of state=
=20
acquisition of power utilities, got national media attention last month whe=
n=20
he announced his proposal to fix the energy crisis -- including the creatio=
n=20
of a state public power authority to provide new generating plants. He talk=
ed=20
tough, and won an enthusiastic response at the convention, when he warned:=
=20
"Out-of-state generators: If you do not take your foot off our throats . . =
.=20
you may leave us no option but to (take) your power plants."=20
A successful developer, Angelides is one of the few Democrats who may not b=
e=20
intimidated by Davis' $26 million war chest. "If he's invested wisely in th=
e=20
past few years, that'd be chump change," said one insider.=20
-- State Controller Kathleen Connell: Connell blasted Davis last weekend,=
=20
telling The Chronicle that "the emperor has no clothes" on the energy crisi=
s=20
and that voters will soon tire of him putting blame on former Gov. Pete=20
Wilson.=20
The governor's people say the talk was born of desperation: She faces term=
=20
limits as controller and is lagging in the polls in her race for Los Angele=
s=20
mayor.=20
-- State Sen. Don Perata: Yes, a real longshot, some delegates said, but th=
e=20
politically hungry and talkative East Bay pol has been offering tough=20
assessments of Davis' performance on energy recently. He'd have a lot of wo=
rk=20
in getting more name ID statewide, but Perata is a master at corralling fre=
e=20
media. Lately, he's been on the tube, morning and night, far more than Davi=
s,=20
with proposals on energy and education -- two of the governor's favorite=20
topics.=20
In addition to the governor's race, candidates are maneuvering for so- call=
ed=20
"down ballot" stateside contests next year.=20
No widely known Democrat is expected to challenge Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante =
or=20
Attorney General Bill Lockyer for their current spots.=20
But term limits will be putting plenty of politicians out of work, and the=
=20
Democrats' sweep of statewide offices in 1998 has left few open spots for t=
he=20
ambitious.=20
Some of the Democratic primary races shaping up:=20
-- Secretary of state: March Fong Eu, who held the job from 1974 to 1994,=
=20
before term limits, has announced she's running again. John Garamendi, the=
=20
state's first elected insurance commissioner and a former longtime=20
legislator, is in, as is Michela Alioto, who lost to incumbent Republican=
=20
Bill Jones four years ago. San Francisco Assemblyman Kevin Shelley also is=
=20
considering a run.=20
-- Insurance commissioner: Judge Harry Low has not yet decided whether he=

Sacramento -- On the eve of a statewide television address by Gov. Gray=20
Davis, action by lawmakers stalled on nearly $1.4 billion in state programs=
=20
to stimulate energy conservation.=20
Penalizing generators for huge profits they have raked in during California=
's=20
energy crisis is just one point Davis may bring up during tonight's speech.=
=20
"I'm of an open mind about that subject," he said after a two-hour meeting=
=20
with Assembly Republicans. "I generally don't think making a profit is wron=
g,=20
but these profits have been excessive."=20
The governor also is expected to discuss recently approved rate increases,=
=20
sweeping conservation efforts and new power plant construction when the=20
cameras come on at 6:05 p.m.=20
The unusual address -- the first by a California governor in nine years --=
=20
comes amid growing criticism that Davis has not done enough to solve the=20
deepening crisis as well as his perceived refusal to keep Californians=20
informed.=20
"A lot of what he has been doing and what he's set in motion is not=20
particularly well known to the average person out there," said Garry South,=
=20
Davis' chief political adviser. "It's hard in a state like California to=20
project specific bits of information outside the context of a paid media=20
campaign."=20
Others see the address as a strong indicator that Davis realizes he is losi=
ng=20
favor with voters.=20
Earlier this year, Davis was widely seen as a leader in resolving the mess.=
=20
DAVIS SLIPPING IN POLLS
That has changed. Recent polls by Assembly Democrats and the Service=20
Employees International Union have shown Davis' popularity -- and that of=
=20
other incumbent lawmakers -- dropping like a stone.=20
As the crisis deepens, there are mounting calls in Sacramento for the state=
=20
to use the power of eminent domain to take over private power plants.=20
California's flawed 1996 deregulation plan required major utilities to sell=
=20
many of their power plants to private companies. State Sens. Don Perata,=20
D-Oakland, and Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, are among those calling for t=
he=20
state to start seizing them.=20
Such a drastic measure is little more than talk right now.=20
Drawing just as much attention is a bill by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-=
=20
San Leandro, that would impose a windfall-profit tax on the generators.=20
GENERATORS' PROFITS UP
Many generators have seen their bottom lines swell as wholesale electricity=
=20
prices skyrocketed. Lawmakers have yet to define "windfall profits," but so=
me=20
favor penalizing generators that sell electricity at rates higher than=20
regulators deem "fair and reasonable."=20
The tax would allow some of the profits to be returned to consumers or to t=
he=20
state, which has spent around $4 billion buying electricity since Jan. 17.=
=20
Although any windfall-profit tax has a long way to go before reaching Davis=
'=20
desk, the governor said yesterday that it is an idea worth considering.=20
"I'm not saying I would sign it or not sign it," Davis said, "but having a=
=20
bill working its way through the Legislature is not an entirely unpleasant=
=20
effect."=20
Anything that might help consumers is sure to please Davis, who is taking=
=20
heat because of a Public Utilities Commission decision allowing utilities t=
o=20
raise rates by an average of 40 percent.=20
TIERED INCREASES
The increase would be tiered, meaning those who consume the most would pay=
=20
the most. Davis, who frequently said he did not want rates to go up, has=20
denied knowing about the PUC increase.=20
Davis told Assembly Republicans yesterday that he would mention the increas=
e=20
during tonight's address. That prompted some lawmakers to speculate he may=
=20
endorse a smaller increase and soften the blow by touting subsidies and=20
rebates for those who conserve electricity.=20
Conservation has long been the keystone of Davis' energy plan. The governor=
=20
is pushing lawmakers to pass nearly $1.4 billion in energy conservation=20
programs so he can sign the bills before tonight's address. Such an effort =
is=20
sure to go down to the wire, however, because the bills sputtered yesterday=
.=20
The bills are a cornucopia of grants, rebates, low-interest loans and other=
=20
expenditures intended to reward Californians who cut down on consumption.=
=20
"This is aimed at giving Californians commonsense tools to begin energy=20
conservation as soon as possible," said Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe, D-Sa=
n=20
Diego.=20
But the bills stalled yesterday amid partisan squabbling. The Senate held u=
p=20
an Assembly bill that would spend $408 million on various conservation=20
efforts because it objected to changes the Assembly made to a Senate=20
proposal.=20
The $1.1 billion Senate bill would set aside $240 million in cash and=20
conservation assistance for the state's poorest ratepayers. The Assembly=20
passed the bill yesterday after adding several provisions benefiting the=20
agriculture industry. Senate Democrats complained the amendments penalized=
=20
urban consumers.=20
Davis has become a tireless cheerleader for conservation, but he realizes i=
t=20
won't be enough to end the crisis.=20
Yesterday, he indicated for the first time that he would support allowing=
=20
private companies and other large users to cut the utilities out of the loo=
p=20
entirely by contracting directly with generators for power.=20
Lawmakers in January passed legislation barring such contracts amid fears t=
he=20
state would have no one to sell power to. But Davis said yesterday that suc=
h=20
a move could preserve the state's creaking electrical grid during the dog=

days of summer.=20

San Jose Looks Past the Energy Crisis=20
Big server farm OKd in hope the electricity will be there=20

Even as the blackouts roll and state budget reserves are drained to purchas=
e=20
electricity, some Silicon Valley officials are confident that California's=
=20
energy crisis will be relatively short lived.=20
That may explain why a proposal to build the world's largest server farm=20
sailed through San Jose's approval process this week, despite the fact that=
=20
the project will consume as much electricity as all the homes in Bakersfiel=
d.=20
"The state is predicting that there will be a whole bunch of new electrical=
=20
power being generated in the next two or three years," said San Jose=20
Councilman Chuck Reed. "We could eventually be back in the position where=
=20
(generators) are begging people to buy their power, like they did in the=20
1980s. "=20
The fact that San Jose-based U.S. DataPort wants to build here at all=20
indicates that even energy-dependent businesses are betting on a rapid=20
solution to California's energy crisis.=20
"I am confident about that, and I think the rest of my colleagues in the ar=
ea=20
are as well," said Grant Sedgwick, president and CEO of San Jose based U. S=
.=20
DataPort. "It won't happen overnight, but in practical terms, we are=20
embarking on a five- to six-year project right now. I think that halfway=20
through, this (energy crisis) will be a part of history."=20
The project approved by the San Jose City Council Tuesday night -- industry=
=20
insiders prefer the term "Internet data center" to the less-dignified "serv=
er=20
farm" -- will be the world's largest, able to handle as much as 15 percent =
of=20
global Internet traffic.=20
The $1.2 billion project will comprise 10 huge air-conditioned warehouses o=
n=20
174 acres, stacked with the computers that run the Internet. The facility i=
s=20
expected to consume 180 megawatts of electricity when fully built out. Ther=
e=20
are scores of smaller server farms in the Silicon Valley area, but none tha=
t=20
comes close to the size, scope and energy draw of the U.S. DataPort facilit=
y.=20
What is significant about all such data centers is that any interruption of=
=20
power wreaks havoc on their equipment. In recognition of the current=20
precarious state of California's electricity grid, U.S. DataPort will build=
 a=20
small natural-gas fired power plant capable of producing 30 megawatts of=20
reliable power to supply phase one of its project. That supply will be back=
ed=20
up more than 80 enormous diesel generators capable of switching on without=
=20
missing a beat.=20
But in order to acquire city permits for additional buildings, the company=
=20
will have to devise a plan for additional energy generation on-site, and co=
me=20
up with a way to eliminate the backup generators that run on highly polluti=
ng=20
diesel fuel.=20
The company will not necessarily be required to build the extra generating=
=20
capacity, or to eliminate the generators. Everything depends on what happen=
s=20
to California's economy and energy situation in coming years.=20
"We will be self-sufficient (in energy) for the first couple of years," sai=
d=20
John Mogannam, senior vice-president of U.S. DataPort. "After that, we do=
=20
believe that the energy problem will be behind us, and there will be=20
sufficient energy available on the grid.=20
"But the City Council has given us a very strong message that we need to se=
ek=20
ways to (eventually) remove those diesel engines from the site. Building a=
=20
full-sized power plant is one option that we will be looking into."=20
U.S. DataPort is now building a similar-sized data facility in Virginia tha=
t=20
will be powered by a 250-megawatt gas-powered turbine, Mogannam said.=20
Something similar might work in San Jose, although any final decision on=20
whether to build will be years away.=20
Company officials will also study a variety of alternative energy sources,=
=20
with the hope that improved technology may make such options viable in the=
=20
coming years.=20
Opponents of the San Jose server farm charge that key portions of the proje=
ct=20
are illegally vague. The Santa Clara Valley Chapter of the Audubon Society=
=20
may consider a lawsuit challenging the council's approval of the project.=
=20
"The biggest potential issue here is that the law doesn't allow you to brea=
k=20
a project into little segments and sneak it into a community," said Craig=
=20
Breon, executive director of the group. "If your true plans are to build a=
=20
250-megawatt plant in the Alviso area, you have to inform the community. Yo=
u=20
have to study it in the environmental documents."=20
Especially troubling is the suspicion that council members approved the=20
project with an eye on uncertain future scenarios, Breon said. "They are=20
talking about a single power plant, but in the meantime we are getting more=
=20
diesel with this project than at any other single site in the Bay Area," he=
=20
said. "Any way you look at it, it's a major air pollution source."=20
Mogannam acknowledged that plans for completing the project, including=20
construction of a power plant, were vague, but pointed out that the city ha=

final say over any plans for the site.=20

More Unpaid Power Plants Face Closing=20
Owners slam PUC silence about bills=20

U224271.DTL=20
As state officials struggle to reduce California's mounting energy debts,=
=20
smaller power companies warned yesterday that more plants will shut down --=
=20
increasing the likelihood of blackouts -- until they get paid all the money=
=20
they are owed.=20
The California Cogeneration Council, an association of small, gas-fired pla=
nt=20
owners, appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for help in=20
recouping sky-high operating costs from utilities.=20
The council's move followed a lawsuit filed Tuesday against PG&E Corp. by o=
ne=20
plant operator, Dynamis Inc. The company charges that it was forced to shut=
=20
down because PG&E has yet to pay for more than $3 million worth of power.=
=20
"You're going to see more lawsuits and more plants closing," council=20
Executive Director Ann MacLeod said in San Francisco. "The blackout situati=
on=20
is just going to get worse."=20
Smaller generators -- known in industry parlance as "qualifying facilities"=
=20
or "QFs" -- are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by PG&E and Southern=
=20
California Edison for electricity received since last fall.=20
Half of the roughly 600 QF plants were shut down last month, contributing t=
o=20
rolling blackouts throughout the state. The plant owners said they were=20
unable to pay for the natural gas needed to keep their facilities running.=
=20
In response, the California Public Utilities Commission voted last week to=
=20
require utilities to pay the QFs for all future power purchases. However, t=
he=20
PUC avoided the thornier question of money already owed to the generators.=
=20
It also changed the way smaller generators calculate their costs, lowering=
=20
the amount that can be charged for natural-gas expenses.=20
Moreover, the PUC has yet to determine how the limited funds collected from=
=20
ratepayers will be divided among the various parties now in line with their=
=20
hands out -- QFs, utilities and the state itself, which has spent more than=
=20
$4 billion purchasing juice on behalf of PG&E and Edison.=20
A final decision still may be weeks away. Nevertheless, PUC members trumpet=
ed=20
last week's order as a solution to all the QFs' troubles.=20
"At a time when every megawatt is needed, we cannot afford for any producti=
on=20
to be lost due to lack of payment," Commissioner Carl Wood said.=20
"This allows us to get supply back online," PUC President Loretta Lynch=20
agreed. "It will get the lights back on in California."=20
Or will it?=20
"The PUC is dead wrong," MacLeod said. "It doesn't add up. There's still th=
e=20
gaping hole of the bills that are past due."=20
For example, Berry Petroleum Co. near Bakersfield operates three small plan=
ts=20
that provide 100 megawatts to California's electricity system -- enough pow=
er=20
to light 100,000 homes. The company estimates it is owed $27 million by PG&=
E=20
and Edison.=20
Jerry Hoffman, Berry's chief executive officer, said he has had to shut dow=
n=20
four of five generating turbines at his plants, and expects the fifth turbi=
ne=20
to be idled by the end of this week.=20
"We just can't cover our costs," he said. "And we're not alone. There are a=
=20
lot of other QFs shutting down."=20
Hoffman said he was bewildered by assertions from Gov. Gray Davis' office=
=20
that the state is entitled to recoup its energy expenses before anyone else=
.=20
"I don't understand how the state can just step to the front of the line wh=
en=20
all this money is owed to us," he said. "We ought to be paid first because =
we=20
were generating power first."=20
In the case of Dynamis, the company shut down its 42-megawatt plant in=20
February after PG&E paid only 15 cents on the dollar for more than $3 milli=
on=20
in outstanding bills.=20
"Dynamis simply does not have the financial resources to continue extending=
=20
credit to PG&E, particularly given PG&E's refusal to make any past due=20
payments and with no assurance of payment for any future deliveries," said=
=20
Michel Gaucher, the company's owner.=20
Dynamis is suing for its back payments as well as suspension of its long-=
=20
term contract with the utility.=20
An average 40 percent rate increase approved by the PUC last week will resu=
lt=20
in an additional $4.8 billion being collected from consumers each year.=20
But not one cent will go toward paying off about $14 billion in debt racked=
=20
up by PG&E and Edison because of soaring wholesale electricity prices.=20
That debt has prevented the utilities from making good on their obligations=
=20
to QFs, and it may be months before PG&E and Edison are once again on firme=
r=20
financial footing.=20
Until then, many of the generating firms say they will be closing their=20
doors, which will only exacerbate California's approaching summer of energy=
=20
discontent.=20
"The PUC's decision not to pay back payments was like a 2 by 4 over the=20
head," MacLeod said. "It told the plant owners that things are just going t=
o=20
get worse."=20

suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.=20
Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy=
=20
prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a=20
windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune sellin=
g=20
power to California this year.=20
A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It=20

it at much higher rates.=20
``We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap=20
enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This=20
profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.=20
Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected=20

For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy thei=

Some programs also can have unintended consequences, he said.=20
Installing energy-saving air conditioners, for instance, can result in a=20

Thornberg said, ``I have a feeling that eventually I'm going to have to sit=

Gov. Davis prepares to address state on energy=20
Posted at 6:40 a.m. PDT Thursday, April 5, 2001=20
BY JENNIFER COLEMAN=20

Associated Press Writer=20



SACRAMENTO (AP) -- While California Gov. Gray Davis prepared to address the=
=20
state Thursday night on energy, economic forecasters predicted his=20
constitutents will pay higher taxes, watch out-of-state investments evapora=
te=20
and suffer scrapped public projects because of the ongoing power crisis.=20
The UCLA Anderson Forecast says the worst economic threat could come from=
=20
state government itself and its scrutiny of private power suppliers, which=
=20
along with blackouts and brownouts, could scare new businesses away.=20
Davis addressed some commercial concerns Wednesday by breaking with his=20
appointees on the Public Utilities Commission by saying private companies a=
nd=20
other large power users should be allowed to contract directly for power wi=
th=20
generators.=20
Critics of allowing direct access include PUC President Loretta Lynch and T=
he=20
Utility Reform Network, who say residential customers and small businesses=
=20
unable to garner such contracts will get stuck with the bill for the billio=
ns=20
of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customer=
s=20
of three cash-strapped utilities.=20
Word came from California's treasurer Wednesday that the state had secured=
=20
$4.1 billion in loans to help pay back the state's power buys.=20
Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy=
=20
prices, Davis reassessed the tools at his disposal Wednesday, saying he is=
=20
open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on=20
electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California th=
is=20
year.=20
Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro, introduced a windfall-profits t=
ax=20
bill Wednesday that would tax gross receipts that ``significantly exceed''=
=20
the cost of producing power.=20
It would also tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and late=
r=20
sold it at much higher rates. The rate of the tax was not specified in the=
=20
bill, and Corbett said she expects the details to be worked out later.=20
``We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap=20
enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This=20
profiteering must stop,'' said Corbett.=20
Senators on the Revenue and Tax Committee have also inserted similar langua=
ge=20
into a pending bill.=20
Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said he doubted a tax on a selecte=
d=20
industry would be legal. The tax would discourage generators from building=
=20
new power plants in California, he said.=20
``The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can =
to=20
increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.=20
Windfall profits taxes do neither of these,'' said Williams.=20
``Clearly it would have an adverse affect on our decisions on new investmen=
t=20
or following through on our planned investments,'' he said.=20
Davis said Wednesday he generally opposes treating profitable companies in=
=20
that manner, ``but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The=
=20
only things companies understand is leverage. I'm not saying I'll sign it a=
nd=20
I'm not saying I won't sign it.''=20
For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy thei=
r=20
power from generators instead of going through the utilities.=20
A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly=
=20
bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts.=20
``That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power=
=20
and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,'' Davis said. ``But=
=20
our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the=
=20
grid, we should encourage, not discourage that.''=20
The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors fo=
r=20
more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized=
=20
his handling of the energy crisis.=20
``I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve=
=20
this challenge,'' Davis said. ``There were a lot of suggestions in there I'=
m=20
willing to adopt.''=20
For instance, he agreed that San Diego Gas and Electric customers should ha=
ve=20
a different benchmark for receiving 20 percent rebates under his program fo=
r=20
consumers who cut their energy use by 20 percent this summer.=20
Unlike other Californians, San Diego residents faced soaring rates last=20
summer and began conserving then, so Davis said they should have to cut 20=
=20
percent from 1999 energy use levels instead of using last summer as a=20
starting point.=20
Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute=
=20
address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television=20
stations to carry live.=20
However, he said he will ``share with them (viewers) the progress that we'v=
e=20
made and what we have to get through.''=20
He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approv=
ed=20
last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and=20
Southern California Edison Co.

Too much hot air about too little power=20
Thursday, April 5, 2001=20
To deal more directly with the energy crisis, Assembly Republicans last wee=
k=20
replaced Assemblyman Bill Campbell of Orange as their leader with Assemblym=
an=20
David Cox of Sacramento. Mr. Cox has some good ideas, but we would urge him=
=20
not to use the energy crisis, tempting as it may be, for pure political gai=
n.=20
His mission should be to fix the mess as much as possible before the summer=
=20
crunch is upon us.=20
Mr. Cox is a former Sacramento County Supervisor and served on the Sacramen=
to=20
Municipal Utility District Board of Directors, giving him some experience i=
n=20
the electricity field. In an interview, he outlined the party's main goals,=
=20
which we found encouraging:=20
l "We will continue to introduce plans and bills that expedite new supply,"=
=20
he said. He criticized Democratic solutions, including Gov. Gray Davis'=20
proposal to buy the power grid and Assembly Bill 1X, which gave the=20
government the authority to use bonds to buy power. Neither creates any new=
=20
energy, Mr. Cox said. "There is one solution, putting more electrons into t=
he=20
system," he insisted. He said some Democrats also understand that fact.
l "Get the QFs back on line in a contractual situation," he said. The=20
qualifying facilities are small producers, usually of alternative sources=
=20
such as wind and geothermal power. "They have to see some prospect of getti=
ng=20
the money that's owed to them" by the utilities, which have withheld paymen=
ts=20
because of their strapped financial situation. The QFs limited their=20
production during last month's blackouts. The QFs supply one-third of the=
=20
state's power and are crucial to limiting blackouts this summer.
l Conservation.
And, he said the GOP opposes rate increases. He believes natural gas prices=
=20
will decline as the weather moderates in Western states and demand slackens=
.
He said, of course, that the attempted 1996 "deregulation" was flawed. But =
he=20
believes real deregulation can work, as it has in other states "if you have=
=20
12 percent to 15 percent more supply than demand. You then have competition=
=20
and competition brings down rates." By contrast, California has to import=
=20
about 20 percent of its power.
Republicans are a minority in both houses of the Legislature. But they=20
obviously hope to score political gains against the reigning Democrats, who=
=20
so far have not been able to shape and communicate an approach to weatherin=
g=20
and recovering from the crisis. Mr. Cox's ideas generally are good -=20
obviously increasing supply is key - but the Republican opposition to retai=
l=20
rate increases seems as na<ve (and unbelievable) as the governor's.=20
The hard truth is that energy prices everywhere have risen, including not=
=20
only natural gas but gasoline and diesel fuel.
We would reiterate to Mr. Cox and to the GOP to minimize politically=20
motivated positions and focus on the merits of a strong recovery plan.=20
California needs to move beyond politics and toward solutions. Mr. Cox shou=
ld=20
help lead the way.

More pain predicted in electric crisis=20
Most economists say increases in utility bills will take some toll on the=
=20
state's condition - sooner or later.=20
April 5, 2001=20
By MARY ANN MILBOURN
and KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register=20
Californians haven't yet felt the full economic effect of electric rate=20
increases, but it's coming, many regional economic experts said Wednesday.=
=20
The rate hikes are like a $5 billion tax, said economist Anil Puri, dean of=
=20
the school of business and economics at California State University,=20
Fullerton.=20
"It will have a negative impact on consumer confidence as well as on the=20
pocketbook," he said. "Prices in general are going up, there are fewer jobs=
=20
and falling incomes. Every little bit adds to that misery. You can't ignore=
=20
it."=20
Economists differ about when and how strongly the effect of rising=20
electricity prices will be felt. That's in part because the effects aren't=
=20
yet showing up in economic surveys.=20
Businesses and consumers, however, report that they are already hurting=20
because of rising power costs.=20
Steven Zimmerman, managing director of the Standard & Poor's bond rating=20
agency, said it's hard to determine right now how much of the state economy=
=20
is already being affected by the rate increases and how much is just the=20
overall slowdown.=20
"If the energy crisis goes on for some length of time, it will affect the=
=20
economy," said Zimmerman, speaking Wednesday at the quarterly UCLA forecast=
=20
conference.=20
Economist Esmail Adibi, director of the Anderson Center for Economic Resear=
ch=20
at Chapman University in Orange, said the 9 percent electricity rate increa=
se=20
in January had little effect because it was offset in large part by a=20
quarter-percent sales tax cut.=20
"But the newest increase will be about $4.8 billion in extra cost," said=20
Adibi, who released his own economic forecast in December. "It's going to=
=20
have some negative impact."=20
The economist who foresees the smallest effect is UCLA visiting Professor=
=20
Christopher Thornberg, who told the quarterly UCLA economic forecast=20
conference that electricity prices would have relatively little economic=20
effect on the long-term economy.=20
Thornberg said electricity is such a small part of the overall cost of doin=
g=20
business that even the companies that have to bear the greatest burden,=20
paying up to 36 percent more for power, will see little effect on their=20
bottom line.=20
Consumers, he said, will be paying more, but it should not affect their=20
overall spending.=20
"Certainly it's going to sting. Certainly it's going to decrease profits, b=
ut=20
it's not that big a hit," he said.=20
Puri, who will release his own economic forecast in May, said Thornberg=20
appeared to be understating the short-term effect of the rate increases.=20
UCLA economist Tom Lieser expects that the electricity crisis will have an=
=20
effect not only on business, but also on government services, because of th=
e=20
$14 billion in bonds the state is expected to sell to pay off its electrici=
ty=20
purchases.=20
"It's nothing that will bankrupt us, but it's money that could have been us=
ed=20
on something else," Lieser said.=20
UCLA economists, for example, believe what remains of the state surplus wil=
l=20
be used to finance K-12 education, but budgets for universities, prisons,=
=20
health care and welfare will not get the funds that had been expected.=20
Locally, the rate increases are affecting the Orange County budget.=20
Diane Thomas, county spokeswoman, said only $13.3 million was budgeted for=
=20
this fiscal year for electricity and natural gas, about the same as what wa=
s=20
spent last year.=20
But by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the county expects to have=20
spent an additional $2.6 million on electricity and natural gas. Officials=

ICF Consulting Study Predicts Turning Point in Wholesale Power Markets




FAIRFAX, Va., April 4 /PRNewswire/ via NewsEdge Corporation -=20
ICF Consulting recently completed the Fourth Edition of its Bulk Power=20

wholesale power markets is at a turning point. After years of generation=20

ICF Consulting does not believe this turning point will occur everywhere at=

potentially serious shortages this summer. "California faces potentially=20

New York City for this summer."=20
ICF Consulting's previous three editions of Bulk Power Outlook strenuously=

warned that the lack of construction would result in extremely high prices=

reaching thousands of dollars per MWh. "Since 1995, we advised everyone to=

Today a different approach is needed."=20
Using the same ICF Consulting IPM(TM) power model from previous studies, th=

Outlook predicts that the current level of plant construction is enough to=
=20
solve shortages. Since construction takes two to three years, relief will n=

Worldwide energy consumption is projected to grow by 59% over the next two=
=20
decades, according to International Energy Outlook 2001 (IEO), a report=20
released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The=
=20
IEO is an annual projection of worldwide energy trends for the subsequent=
=20
20-year period.=20

A whopping half of the projected growth is expected to occur in the=20
developing nations of Asia (including China, India and South Korea) and in=
=20
Central and South America, where strong economic growth is expected to spur=
=20
robust demand for energy.=20

The report predicts, in a base-case scenario, that oil prices will remain a=
t=20
current levels of $25 to $28 per barrel until 2003 when they return to the=
=20
price trajectory anticipated in last year's outlook for the mid-term. Last=
=20
year, the agency forecasted world oil prices would be $22 per barrel in=20
constant 1998 U.S. dollars ($36 per barrel in nominal dollars) at the end o=
f=20
the projection period.=20

"Persistently high world oil prices, stronger than anticipated economic=20
recovery in Southeast Asia and robust economic growth in the former Soviet=
=20
Union (FSU) have all impacted the mid-term outlook for world energy use," t=
he=20
current report said.=20

Natural gas will dominate
The report forecasts that natural gas will remain the fastest growing=20
component of primary world energy consumption. Over the next two decades, g=
as=20
use is projected to nearly double=01*reaching 162 trillion cubic feet in 20=
20.=20
Natural gas is expected to account for the largest increment in electricity=
=20
generation (accounting for 41% of the total increment in energy used for=20
electricity generation).

"Gas use surpassed coal use (on a Btu basis) for the first time in 1999, an=
d=20
by 2020 it is expected to exceed coal use by 44%," said the report.=20

While the official forecast is that natural gas will dominate world energy=
=20
growth and realize substantial market growth based on extrapolation of=20
current fundamentals, concern is percolating among some industry players=20
about the potential demand destruction that could accompany high gas prices=
,=20
at least in U.S. markets.=20

"If we continue to see $5 and $10 gas prices over any extended period of=20
time, the likelihood that natural gas will capture the market opportunities=
=20
that are presented is remote," said Bill Hobbs, president of energy marketi=
ng=20
and trading at Williams Cos. Inc.=20

In the U.S, high natural gas prices have industry insiders pondering the=20
possibility of new coal or nuclear plants, an option that just last year=20
would have seemed politically infeasible.=20

"I think a healthy gas price is in the $2.50 to $3 range," said Hobbs, as=
=20
reported by Reuters, after addressing the Ziff Energy North American Natura=
l=20
Gas Strategies Conference in Houston.=20

Recent EIA projections for the domestic gas industry are above these levels=
.=20
It is "unlikely that wellhead prices will decline to the level of $2 per=20
thousand cubic feet of one year ago," Mary J. Hutzler, EIA's director of=20
forecasting, told a House committee late in March. "In 2001, the average=20
wellhead price is projected to be about $4.70 per thousand cubic feet."=20

Nuclear grows, renewables slow
Worldwide, nuclear power will continue to remain viable during the forecast=
=20
period, said the IEA report. Global consumption of electricity generated fr=
om=20
nuclear power is expected to increase from 2,396 billion kWh in 1999 to 2,6=
36=20
billion kWh in 2015 before declining to 2,582 billion kWh at the end of the=
=20
forecast period.=20

"Most of the growth in nuclear capacity in the reference case is expected t=
o=20
occur in the developing world (particularly developing Asia), where=20
consumption of electricity from nuclear power is projected to increase by=
=20
4.9% per year between 1999 and 2020," said the report. Nuclear growth from=
=20
new plants in the industrialized world is not anticipated except in France=
=20
and Japan.=20

Renewable energy use is projected to rise by 53% between 1999 and 2020, but=
=20
its current 9% share of total energy consumption will drop to 8% by 2020. T=
he=20
agency attributes this to the fact that renewable energy will remain costli=
er=20
than fossil fuel alternatives. "Despite recent high prices, over the long=
=20
term energy prices are forecasted to remain relatively low, constraining th=
e=20
expansion of hydroelectricity and other renewable resources," the report=20
said.=20

"Much of the growth in renewable energy over the next two decades is=20
attributed to large-scale hydroelectric projects in the developing world,=
=20
particularly developing Asia, where China, India and other developing natio=
ns=20
(Malaysia, Nepal and Vietnam, among others) are already building or plannin=
g=20
to build hydro projects that each exceed 1,000 MW," concluded the agency.=
=20

Energy intensity improves=20
In the IEO forecast, energy intensity=01*energy consumption per dollar of g=
ross=20
domestic product=01*in the industrialized world is expected to improve=20
(decrease) by 1.3% per year between 1999 and 2020, about the same rate of=
=20
improvement observed between 1970 and 1999.=20

"Energy use per person generally declined from 1970 through the mid-1980s,=
=20
and then tended to increase as energy prices declined. Per capita energy us=
e=20
is expected to increase slightly (in the U.S.) through 2020, as efficiency=
=20
gains only partially offset higher demand for energy services," said EIA's=
=20
Hutzler in her congressional testimony. Energy intensity is also projected =
to=20
improve in the developing countries=01*by 1.4% per year=01*as their economi=
es begin=20
to behave more like those of the industrialized countries as a result of=20
improving standards of living.=20

Extrapolation of all these trends leads to predictions of growth in carbon=
=20
dioxide emissions of 5.8 billion metric tons carbon equivalent in 1990 to 7=
.8=20
billion metric tons in 2010 and 9.8 billion metric tons by 2020.=20

"The rate of worldwide energy and carbon emissions growth would be=20
considerably higher, except for continued improvements in energy intensity,=
"=20
the report said.=20

Not surprisingly, much of the rise in carbon emissions will occur in the=20
developing world, where emerging economies are expected to produce the=20
