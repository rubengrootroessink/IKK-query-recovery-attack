continue the relationship that we have established with you. We are currently 
in the process of contacting you by phone. Please feel free to contact us at 
your convenience to discuss why we feel that this change will provide a 
mutual benefit for both yourself, and to the Emery Financial Group in terms 
of the service it will allow us to provide for you. Following is a list of 
our new phone numbers:
