Johan:

Rebecca and I have reviewed the statement.  We are not comfortable that we 
understand the purpose of the statement at this time and the message we are 
trying to send.  Rebecca would like to have a telephone call to make sure we 
fully understand the reason for and purpose of the statement.  I will ask 
Loretta Brelsford to coordinate this for tomorrow morning.

Rebecca / Jim:

Attached is a final draft media statement on DPC's reaction to the 
recommendations of the Godbole energy review report. As you know, the report 
was submitted last week to the Government of Maharashtra and has generated 
widespread media interest both in India and internationally.

Wade and the India legal team have approved the statement but we would be 
grateful if you could let us know if you are comfortable with the statement 
before we distribute it to the Indian media, currently planned for Wednesday 
morning (late evening Tuesday in Houston). 

Thanks,

Johan
