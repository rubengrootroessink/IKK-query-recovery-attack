Attached is a quick blurb on the major protests filed in the PGE/Sierra 
merger.  There's good news and bad news.  The good news is that there were 
only a couple of significant protests filed.  The bad new is that the 
protests are quite significant.  In addition to the two protests Adam 
addresses, there was a protest filed by the Nevada Public Service Commission, 
and an additional protest filed by Truckee Donner.  The Nevada Attorney 
General's Bureau of Consumer Protection also filed a brief protest.  

We are getting a copy of the rest of the protests now and will have a more 
detailed summary of all of the protests early next week.  

Adam has been in touch with the Scadden attorneys and Peter Fox-Penner, the 
economic consultant who performed the Appendix A market power analysis.  We 
will be working closely with them to develop an answer to the protests.  
Answers are due on May 18.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah

 <<85876_1.DOC>> Attached is a summary of the substantive interventions and
of responses to the arguments.  Regarding the Truckee-Donner intervention, 
Matt
Estes (Scadden) points out that the FERC will either require or not require 
the hold
harmless extension, but won't go to hearing or otherwise delay the
proceeding to deal with it.
