Attached please find a (confidential) team list that has just been put 
together for Project California.  Please review it and let me know as soon as 
possible, via e-mail, if there are any revisions at all that need to be 
made.  This is the first draft of this team list, and I am sure will be a 
work-in-progress, so please bear with us!
Thanks, Stacy
