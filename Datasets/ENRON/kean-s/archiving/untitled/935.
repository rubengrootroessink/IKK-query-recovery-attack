Steve:

Your angle is much better for the corporation, and a lot of the below might 
be "mastering the obvious," but here it is.

-----------------------------------------------------
 The petroleum, natural gas, and electricity price situations have a 
different set of facts but a common demoninator--very tight infrastructure 
relative to energy demand.  Here is a general set of conclusions with a few 
"sound bites."


* The current energy price situation is "all about economics."  It is 
economics 101--supply and demand.  Demand has been rising faster than supply 
with a predictable response.  This is the bad news for consumers.  The good 
news is that there is reason to believe that prices for oil and natural gas 
are at the top of their commodity price cycle.  The NYMEX futures market 
shows a "backwardation curve" for both--look in the daily Wall Street Journal 
in Section C under "Futures Prices"  that usually is around page 14.  Look at 
the settle price for the different energy commodities and the prices after 
the prompt month (October) fall over the next months and years except for 
this winter's natural gas price.

* Big oil did not suddenly get big or greedy with petroleum prices any more 
than "big gas" has with natural gas.  Many of the same players were 
profit-maximizing during the previous price slump.

* The constraint on energy markets is not the resource base but the 
infrastructure to produce, refine, and transport supplies.  Infrastructure 
constraints have had a cumulative effect of slowing the great engine of 
market supply,    reflected siting issues and also low profitability (partly 
the result of rapid implementation of new environmental requirements).

* The solution is to stop taking supply for granted and build more 
flexibility and incentives in the system to profitably meet ever-rising 
demand.  Energy investment must compete against many New Economy investment 
opportunities that have potentially high rates of return.

Oil

This is a global market so declining U.S. production is a very small part of 
the world supply, but the real constraint is domestic refining capacity.  
Since 1990, operable U.S. refineries have declined from 205 to 159 when 50 
refineries closed and only 4 new refineries entered the market.  [National 
Petroleum Council, "U.S. Petroleum Refining," June 2000, p. 23.  Other 
refineries have been able to expand to increase overall capacity, but 
capacity utilization has risen rapidly in recent years and is above 95%--a 
tight situation.  EPA permits to allow further expansion is a major issue to 
making sure that domestic infrastructure keeps up with demand (p. 27).  A 
number of proposed requirements to further improve the environmental quality 
of gasoline has raised profitability questions as well (pp. 27-30). 

The two actions the U.S. can take in the short run to increase crude supplies 
are to lift the embargo on Iraq and withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve (up to 3 mmbd).  Liquidating the reserve could be part of a 
privatization program to get support from the free market community, and the 
proceeds could be used to help low income energy users this winter.  The days 
don't get much more "rainy" than now given that without price controls price 
and not supply is in question in an "emergency."

A longer run approach must be to encourage domestic and international 
drilling to make the supply response as elastic as possible to higher 
prices.  Alaska activity such as drilling at the Arctic National Wildlife 
Reserve (ANWR) would be a major contribution to world supplies.

On the gasoline side, much has been written about "boutique fuels" where 
certain environmental requirements are required for certain regions that 
makes the supply/demand balance very sensitive to interruptions (such as 
refinery downtime or a pipeline closure).  The key to prevent price spikes 
for consumers is to not let new environmental requirements outrace technology 
or infrastructure constraints.  This discontinuity happened earlier this 
summer in Chicago, for example, where gasoline prices rose well above $2 per 
gallon.

Electricity

This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more 
efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued 
uses.  California in particular has followed a "soft" energy path where 
conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants.  
The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances 
(such as refrigerators) are using less power.  General economic growth also 
means many new appliances, traditional and new, are being produced and used, 
adding to power demand.

Natural Gas

 Natural gas supplies (and infrastructure to some degree) must catch up to 
high demand after many years of slumping gas prices and reduced incentive.  
Over 200 Tcf of potential gas reserves is in areas that are off limits to 
drilling--something that should be corrected given the advances in drilling 
technology that make exploration and production much less invasive to surface 
area than ever before.  Other public policy drivers should be a continued 
emphasis on expedited certification for new pipelines and avoiding new short 
run regulatory "fixes."  Past this winter, however, gas prices are expected 
to decline, so consumers can lock in long term prices that are below current 
prices.


Conclusion

Energy supply and infrastructure have been taken for granted for too long.  
It was assumed that low prices would continue despite increasing 
disincentives to increase supply and infrastructure to meet demand.  Demand 
has also increased faster than thought due to economic prosperity and the 
"wealth effect."  Market forces can correct the imbalance over time without 
regulatory quick fixes and with reasonable incentives for industry 
performance.
