FYI -- When Dan Larcamp was here last week, we discussed access to 
information.  He stated that he does not think that any utilities, including 
marketers, are providing enough real time data to FERC.  (We have given FERC 
EOL passwords.)  Lloyd told Dan that FERC should get access to the NERC 
information for a start and Dan said that FERC was reluctant to do that 
politically because FERC doesn't like signing non-disclosure agreements, but 
they may go ahead and sign to get the process started.

We discussed the TLR issues this summer and FERC staff's finding on lack of 
transmission utility data noted in the Investigations.  Dan told me that FERC 
is currently at "one of my favorite utilities" [must be Entergy or SOCO] 
taking depositions and making the utility go through boxes of TLR data.
