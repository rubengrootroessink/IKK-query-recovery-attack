Re:  Administration's electric
restructuring bill, evaluate the feasibility of a national electric grid,
help advise the administration on the steps necessary to help solve our

crisis, work with Congress, and help craft many other policies that will
positively impact the competitive electric industry.  This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity that I felt I could not pass up.
