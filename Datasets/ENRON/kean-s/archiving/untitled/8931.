Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---"regret" of the slimy 
variety:

My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality 
of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and 
has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison 
rape is proper punishment for criminals. 
My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my 
lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly 
reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender 
database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My 
office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at 
Corcoran State Prison. 
I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary 
corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of 
Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful 
corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark. 
Bill Lockyer 
Attorney General 
Sacramento
