Since terminations are processed in lag, here is the report as of 5/20.   
Thanks.



Major takeaways :  The number of good performers leaving in recent weeks is 
increasing.  Although termination activity is highest seen in recent years at 
1,300 ytd, there have been 1900 new hires (including acquisitions) - a net 
growth of 600 employees.  More details in the attachment.  Thanks.
