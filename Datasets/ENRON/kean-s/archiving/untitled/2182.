Steve,

In addition to Perot Systems, I would contact:

ABB
Ralph Masiello
Vice President & General Manager
Systems Control Division in Santa Clara
408-988-3200

Siemens - I am still working on the right person to contact.

These guys are major global players in the power industry and have a lot of 
investment in software  and systems.  They clearly would have an interest in 
setting the rules.  

If you would like me call them and begin the dialogue, let me know.

Jeff
