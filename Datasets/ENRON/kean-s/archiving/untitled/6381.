Hi Don,

It was great meeting you this morning and I look forward to working with you! 

I wanted to follow-up on the two most critical outstanding issues currently 
and get an idea on when you expect to have some information.

(1) City counsel (Anthony Hall?) - Would I be exempt from access by the 
public and be considered a private entity similar to executive recruitment 
firms?
(2) List of names and telephone numbers of Fire Department personnel we 
should speak to

The telephone message I left for you earlier today was also regarding this 
matter. 

Thanks,

Lisa Connolly
