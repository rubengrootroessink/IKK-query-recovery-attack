Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency powe=
r=20
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001)=20
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a=
=20
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order=
=20
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state=20
without guarantee of payment.=20
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect b=
ut=20
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plan=
t=20
off-line for maintenance.=20
On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California=
=20
landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction=
=20
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.=
=20
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20=
=20
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell fou=
nd=20
that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat."=20
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals=
=20
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a hi=
gh=20
likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal.=20
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the=20
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel=20
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in=
=20
July.=20
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least=20
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which=20
maintains and controls power transmissions.=20
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down a=
ny=20
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.=20
"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change=
=20
anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a=20
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely=
=20
could have a system emergency."=20
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but=20
declined to specify their next move.=20
"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company=
=20
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate."=20
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. Distric=
t=20
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,=
=20
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and=
=20
production of electricity.=20
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of=
=20
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n.=20
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sale=
s=20
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,=
=20
and that goes directly to an appellate court.=20
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two=
=20
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even thoug=
h=20
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopeless=
ly=20
in debt.=20
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't p=
ay=20
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales =
to=20
the utilities.=20
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houst=
on=20
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &=20
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue=20
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required =
to=20
sell to companies that are not creditworthy.=20
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators c=
an=20
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.=20
"My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however,=
=20
that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to=20
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to=20
emergency demands for power.=20
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no=20
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generator=
s=20
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must=20
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.=20
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special=
=20
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.=20
"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court=20
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he=
=20
said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short=
=20
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially a=
t=20
risk."=20
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for=
=20
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amen=
d=20
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its=
=20
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge h=
as=20
jurisdiction.=20
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.=20
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for=20
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the bi=

utilities and sell its power on the open market.=20
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants=
=20
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in=20
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell=

its power to PG&E.=20

In TV address, Davis embraces rate increase
By Dan Smith
BEE DEPUTY CAPITOL BUREAU CHIEF
(Published April 6, 2001)=20
Seeking to ease Californians' energy fears, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday=20
proposed a tiered electricity rate increase that would hit the heaviest pow=
er=20
users the hardest.=20
The Democratic governor, whose popularity has been plummeting, told a=20
statewide television audience in a five-minute speech from his Capitol=20
office: "It's become increasingly clear ... that some rate increases now ar=
e=20
necessary to keep our lights on and our economy strong."=20
The address came as California enters its fifth month of acute power woes=
=20
that have resulted in periodic electricity blackouts.=20
In embracing a rate increase as part of the solution to California's energy=
=20
nightmare, Davis joined a long list of financial and energy experts --=20
including members of his own staff -- who for months have said a rate=20
increase is imperative.=20
The state Public Utilities Commission last week approved a $4.8 billion a=
=20
year, average 30 percent rate increase for customers of cash-strapped Pacif=
ic=20
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &=20
Electric.=20
But Davis said his plan, which he will ask the PUC to approve instead, is=
=20
better. Administration officials said the governor's plan goes easier on=20
commercial users and conservation-minded residential users, but preserves t=
he=20
largest rate increases for heavy residential users. Sacramento Municipal=20
Utility District customers would be unaffected by Davis' proposal.=20
The 55 percent of PG&E residential customers who use less than 130 percent =
of=20
the "baseline" amount of power, for instance, would see no increase. Medium=
=20
users -- those using between 130 percent and 200 percent of the baseline=20
amount -- would see an average bill of $70 rise to $77. But heavy users wou=
ld=20
see their bills go from $138 a month to $189.=20
"Here's the point," Davis said. "The more you use, the more you pay. The mo=
re=20
you conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon=
=20
against blackouts and price gouging."=20
The rate increase would come on top of an average 9 percent residential rat=
e=20
increase imposed in January. Davis advisers said the proposed increase woul=
d=20
eliminate the need for an additional 10 percent increase scheduled to take=
=20
effect next year.=20
Davis said his plan would raise enough money to "restore the utilities to=
=20
financial stability" if the companies agree to sell their transmission line=
s=20
to the state, drop their lawsuits against the state and promise to sell che=
ap=20
power for 10 years. The administration has been negotiating to buy the powe=
r=20
transmission lines for weeks, and has made little progress with PG&E.=20
Even though the governor's rate proposal would raise about 15 percent less=
=20
revenue than the PUC plan, administration officials insisted it would provi=
de=20
the utility companies enough money to cover future power purchases and redu=
ce=20
their debts over time. They said they discovered that the state can buy pow=
er=20
more cheaply than the PUC thought it could and presumed greater savings=20
through conservation.=20
Davis' plan relies heavily on floating billions of dollars in bonds,=20
essentially stretching the impact of a rate hike over as many as 15 years.=
=20
Not only would the state borrow about $12 billion to pay for its purchases,=
=20
but the utilities would borrow about $8 billion. They'd repay the $8 billio=
n=20
through a slice of the money generated by the rate increase. The utilities=
=20
also would get a cash infusion of something less than $7 billion from the=
=20
sale of the transmission grid.=20
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said=
=20
Davis' numbers, while apparently offering a "bailout" of utilities' debts=
=20
designed to please Wall Street, simply don't add up.=20
"He's cooking the books to lower the apparent price to the public, and then=
=20
they're going to figure out a way to ram this down our throats after the 20=
02=20
election," he said.=20
Analysts called the plan long overdue and questioned whether it would work.=
=20
"It's definitely a plan from the Wall Street cookbook, but can he get it=20
done? Can he get it done in a believable time frame?" said bond analyst Sha=
wn=20
Burke of Barclays Capital in New York.=20
Davis' speech disappointed nearly all other parties.=20
"Unfortunately, the steps the governor announced tonight still do not appea=
r=20
to offer a comprehensive solution to resolve California's energy crisis,"=
=20
PG&E said in a prepared statement.=20
Davis continued to blame power generators for "ripping us off" and federal=
=20
regulators for failing to stop them, and spent much of his speech detailing=
=20
the steps that he and state lawmakers have taken to confront the crisis thu=
s=20
far.=20
"Those around (the Capitol) have heard the speech," said Senate President P=
ro=20
Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "He was talking to 34 million Californian=
s=20
who hadn't."=20
Some gubernatorial advisers had been pushing for the speech for weeks,=20
arguing that Davis needed to explain his actions -- and his intentions -- a=
s=20
the onset of warm weather enhances the prospect of power blackouts.=20
Davis has come under increasing criticism, including from some members of h=
is=20
own party, for failing to stem the crisis. Detractors say Davis has been=20
indecisive -- even inattentive -- in his handling of the crisis, while his=
=20
proposals falter in the Legislature and at negotiating tables with=20
near-bankrupt utilities.=20
Consumer groups, meanwhile, say Davis' failure to more forcefully take on=
=20
power generators has allowed the crisis to fester, and they blame him for t=
he=20
rate increases. As the 2002 re-election campaign looms, some private polls=
=20
now say support for the once-popular Davis is eroding.=20
Davis didn't make believers out of Republicans. Assembly GOP leader Dave Co=
x=20
said the speech was more talk than substance. "Frankly, he didn't offer any=
=20
new solutions to the problems," said Cox, of Fair Oaks. "What we heard=20
tonight was the governor saying, 'Oops, I guess we're going to have to rais=

rates,' while all along he'd been saying a rate increase wasn't necessary.=

Governor's speech transcript


(Published April 6, 2001)=20
Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' remarks on energy:=20
Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most=20
difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.=20
Simply stated, we have two problems: Supply is too low and costs are too=20
high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created back in 1996.=
=20
But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. An=
d=20
that's what I'm doing.=20
The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also cut=
=20
back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall and=
=20
supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume=
.=20
Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant wa=
s=20
built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed 12=20
major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this=20
without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.=20
Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants =
to=20
independent generating companies. The generators are free to charge whateve=
r=20
they want because they're governed only by federal regulators who refuse to=
=20
control wholesale energy prices.=20
This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the roo=
f,=20
driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.=20
In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California steppe=
d=20
in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy. We=20
didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the power on a=
nd=20
the economy strong. That's not all:=20
We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower=20
prices.=20
I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts the=
=20
utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.=20
We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.=20
We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of pow=
er=20
plants.=20
We're launching an $800 million conservation program.=20
We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power. If=
=20
the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs, we'll=20
build them ourselves.=20
And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off,=20
we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct.=20
We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real progress=
.=20
Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates. It's=
=20
become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas prices, th=
e=20
feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of supply, that some=
=20
increases now are necessary to keep our lights on and our economy strong.=
=20
But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate=
=20
hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that=
=20
will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and motivate the=
=20
biggest users to cut back.=20
Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the=20
rest, the average increase will be 26 and a half percent. But many in that=
=20
group will pay only about a 10 percent rate increase. The heaviest users wi=
ll=20
see their rates rise 34 and a half percent on average. That includes busine=
ss=20
paying their share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've al=
l=20
been paying since last winter.=20
But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.=20
Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more you conserve=
,=20
the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon against=20
blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll help secure our=
=20
energy future.=20
Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financia=
l=20
stability -- if they agree to three main conditions:=20
They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years. Agree=
=20
to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuits which seek=
=20
to double your electricity rates.=20
My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power, stabilizes=
=20
the utilities and promotes conservation.=20
Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through the=
=20
summer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.=20
Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, and reduce=
=20
consumption in office buildings, supplies and government facilities.=20
My friends, we do have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We a=
re=20
34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimize=20
disruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We've withstoo=
d=20
earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.=20
Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'll ge=
t=20
through this as well.=20
Thank you and good night.=20

Dan Walters: Davis finally acknowledges 'crisis,' backs a rate increase


(Published April 6, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis -- under fire from the media and other politicians for his=
=20
passive, incremental handling of the state's deepening energy crisis --=20
unveiled Thursday what he said was a comprehensive scheme to resolve it,=20
including a hefty increase in power rates paid by most consumers.=20
It was a full-court press by Davis and his administration, including a brie=
f=20
statewide television address and a turnout of aides to sell the scheme to t=
he=20
media. Davis -- for the first time -- even used the term "crisis" to descri=
be=20
the situation after weeks of insisting it was merely a "challenge."=20
Clearly, a major motivating factor in the governor's new activism is that h=
is=20
own re-election in 2002 is now in peril if the energy crisis persists and h=
e=20
continues to deal with it reactively. Editorial writers have been describin=
g=20
Davis' reactive approach as cowardly, and private polls have been indicatin=
g=20
that since an unexpected power blackout hit last month, Davis' approval=20
ratings have been plummeting, from well over 60 percent to perhaps half tha=
t=20
level. And certainly Davis' own nonstop polling has told him the same thing=
.=20
While much of Thursday evening's five-minute address was a truncated versio=
n=20
of what Davis has been saying publicly for the past few weeks, most recentl=
y=20
at the state Democratic convention in Anaheim last weekend, the one new=20
element was an endorsement of rate increases after months of insisting that=
=20
the problems could be resolved "within the existing rate structure." Davis=
=20
proposed a rate boost similar in structure, but apparently slightly less,=
=20
than the one tentatively endorsed by the state Public Utilities Commission=
=20
last week. Davis had insisted that the PUC, although controlled by his=20
appointees, had acted on its own, but the widespread skepticism about that=
=20
posture merely added to his image problems.=20
Like the PUC plan, the Davis rate scheme would concentrate the rate increas=
es=20
on heavy residential power users and businesses. "I'm urging the (PUC) to=
=20
adopt a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve=
=20
and motivate the biggest users to cut back," Davis said, adding that the pl=
an=20
will "restore the utilities to financial stability" if they agree to sell=
=20
their intercity power transmission system to the state, provide low-cost=20
power to the state for 10 years and drop federal lawsuits seeking=20
compensation for their immense debts.=20
It's unclear, however, whether the average 26.5 percent boost in rates to=
=20
customers of the three major privately owned utilities -- about 70 percent =
of=20
Californians -- will do all that the Democratic governor insists it will. H=
e=20
and his aides say it will cover the $5 billion or so that the state's gener=
al=20
fund already has spent on emergency power purchases since January, finance=
=20
future purchases and still provide enough "headroom" to pay off the=20
utilities' $13 billion in debts, part of which would be covered by the=20
transmission grid buyout. But the utilities and their creditors were alread=
y=20
complaining that the PUC's somewhat larger rate boost was too small to cove=
r=20
all the various costs and debts.=20
Davis aides refused to release specific numbers on how each cost factor wou=
ld=20
be covered by the proposed rate boost. The governor's hike would come on to=
p=20
of a 9 percent surcharge on power bills imposed in January and now being ma=
de=20
permanent.=20
Even if it pencils out and is implemented by the PUC, however, the Davis pl=
an=20
would leave Californians with some of the nation's highest utility rates an=
d=20
invite a backlash from consumer activists who have been threatening to=20
sponsor a 2002 ballot measure if there's a "bailout" of utilities. The plan=
=20
would also have to win the approval of Wall Street bankers, who would=20
underwrite and market the billions of dollars in bonds that Davis wants to=
=20
float to pay for past debts and future power costs.=20
Will it be implemented? Will it work? Will it arrest Davis' slide in the=20
polls? No one can say for certain -- and that includes the governor himself=

Davis Acknowledges Need for Rate Hike=20

Electricity: In a statewide TV broadcast, he says the average would be 26.5=
%.=20
For the first time, he calls situation a "crisis."=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--After spending months voicing opposition to rate hikes, Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis acknowledged to a statewide television audience Thursday night t=
he=20
need for an electricity rate increase that would average 26.5%.
?????For the first time calling it an "energy crisis," Davis enumerated ste=
ps=20
he has taken, then said he has fought "tooth and nail against raising rates=
."=20
But citing a need for increases, the Democratic governor called for a tiere=
d=20
system in which people who use the most electricity pay the most--as much a=
s=20
37% more if they use more than twice their minimum allotment.
?????"Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay," Davis said. "T=
he=20
more you conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term=
=20
weapon against blackouts and price gouging."
?????Davis said his proposed rate plan is sufficient to help reduce the=20
$13-billion debt of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.=
=20
Although the bulk of the rate increase would be used to help California=20
finance bonds for long-term power purchases, about 10% to 15% would be=20
earmarked for the utilities--so long as they agree to sell their transmissi=
on=20
lines to the state, according to the administration.
?????The decision to offer the utilities at least some rate hike monies=20
brought a sharp response from lawmakers. Consumer advocates also are sure t=
o=20
be unhappy.
?????"We are not in this business to bail out these guys," said Senate=20
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco).
?????Added Harry Snyder of Consumers Union: "Absolute giveaway . . . He is=
=20
going to pay them off completely for all their mistakes."
?????The governor took the unusual step of reserving air time on statewide=
=20
television at a time when he is slipping in polls and surveys show that the=
=20
public is increasingly concerned about the energy crisis. Gov. Pete Wilson=
=20
took a similar step during the recession in 1992 when he moved to raise tax=
es=20
and cut government spending.
?????The speech took on greater urgency as the California Independent Syste=
m=20
Operator, the entity that oversees power distribution, warned Thursday that=
=20
the state will face 34 days of rotating blackouts if consumers and business=
es=20
use the same amount of electricity this summer that they did last year. The=
=20
blackouts could be extensive enough to darken 5 million homes at once.
?????The governor's speech came hours after the Legislature approved a reco=
rd=20
$1.1 billion in energy conservation measures designed to provide consumers=
=20
with incentives to reduce electricity use.=20
?????In his speech, Davis renewed his call to Californians to curtail=20
electricity use by at least 10%, even as a new report was issued warning th=
at=20
the state faces repeated summer blackouts because of a major gap in the=20
supply of power during the coming months.
?????"We are 34 million strong, and if each of us does our part, we can=20
minimize disruptions and get through the summer," Davis said.
?????The governor did not speak in detail on any issue, including the rate=
=20
hike. The talk lasted a mere five minutes, delivered in fewer than 800 word=
s.
?????Under Davis' proposal, Southern California Edison residential customer=
s=20
would face an average increase of 2.21 cents per kilowatt hour. San Diego G=
as=20
& Electric customers would have a 2.57-cent hike, while Pacific Gas &=20
Electric would have a 2.44-cent boost. Business rates would rise slightly=
=20
more.
?????Davis blamed the rate hikes on rising natural gas prices, a lack of=20
adequate generation and the federal government's refusal to cap wholesale=
=20
power prices.
?????Rates for customers of the state's two largest utilities rose 9% in=20
January. That boost remains in effect. Legislation approved earlier this ye=
ar=20
bars further rate increases for those who use up to 30% more than their=20
so-called baseline allocation.
?????According to administration estimates, 53% of consumers would experien=
ce=20
no rate hike beyond the 9% boost approved in January. A fourth of all=20
households would face increases averaging 34.5%.
?????Under the proposal, which requires Public Utilities Commission approva=
l,=20
people who use up to 200% of their baseline allocation would see rates on=
=20
that portion of their electricity use go up by 9%, plus the 9% already=20
imposed for a total of 18%.
?????Electricity users who consume more than twice their baseline allocatio=
n=20
would pay between 33% and 37% more for kilowatts used beyond 200% of their=
=20
baseline allocation.
?????Davis' proposed rate increase is somewhat lower than that proposed by=
=20
the PUC, in part because he had more information, including the price that=
=20
the state is paying for electricity, his aides said.
?????"My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,=20
stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation," Davis said.
?????Although there has been wide news coverage of the crisis, the governor=
's=20
aides said Davis felt a need to talk directly to Californians to sum up the=
=20
steps that he has taken to solve the problem.
?????Perhaps adding to the urgency, utility customers could start seeing=20
increases in their bills as early as next month. Further raising the stakes=
=20
for the speech, Davis warned this week that supplies will be so short that=
=20
there could be blackouts by the end of the month, and continue into May and=
=20
June.
?????"The public is more aware of what is going on on this issue than any=
=20
other issue I have seen, ever," said Democratic political consultant Gale=
=20
Kaufman. "People have gotten three or four bills that they're unhappy with=
=20
and they may have been in a blackout or two. There is a concern for the=20
future.
?????"By not talking to the public for a long time," Kaufman said, "and=20
focusing it on one speech in one day, people will dissect this five minutes=
,=20
much more than if he would have had a regular dialogue."
?????In what some political consultants see as a reflection of Davis'=20
declining political strength, a recent Times poll showed that in Davis'=20
hometown of Los Angeles, only 14% are more likely to vote for a candidate=
=20
endorsed by Davis, while 21% would be less likely.
?????Several recent private polls show that a majority of Californians woul=
d=20
not vote to reelect Davis if he were on the ballot today, though Davis does=
=20
not face voters in a general election for 19 months, giving him plenty of=
=20
time to recover.
?????"People need to be reassured that there is a strong sense of direction=
,"=20
said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant. "I don't think people are looki=
ng=20
for a magic wand. But they need a sense that there is sense of direction."
?????Other political consultants said Davis used television to get his=20
message out because newspaper accounts have raised questions about his=20
handling of the situation. Also, voters who get the bulk of their informati=
on=20
from television news generally have less knowledge about the nuances of the=
=20
crisis.
?????"He is not doing well with the print story," said Republican consultan=
t=20
Wayne C. Johnson, "so he has decided to change venues."
?????Johnson, like many consultants, also said the governor's declining pol=
l=20
numbers likely influenced his decision to make the television appearance,=
=20
carried on most stations across the state during 6 p.m. news shows.
?????"Gray Davis doesn't do anything that the polls don't dictate," Johnson=
=20
said. "He is doing this because the polls show his support is in free-fall.=
"
?????Until Thursday, Davis had not characterized the situation as a "crisis=
,"=20
instead calling it a "challenge." That euphemism raised the hackles of many=
=20
legislators.
?????"It's pretty clear: The public is angry and scared," said state Sen. D=
on=20
Perata (D-Alameda). "They want a sense that someone is in control, and that=
=20
there is some certitude of where we're going. We're lacking both."
?????The Legislature, meanwhile, approved two measures touted as ways to cu=
t=20
the state's power needs this summer, when hot temperatures traditionally=20
cause demand to surge--a situation that this year could result in blackouts=
.
?????The bills had been bogged down in squabbling between the Assembly and=
=20
Senate. The delay raises questions about whether the conservation incentive=
s=20
will be in place long enough to have an immediate effect.
?????The bills, a $709-million measure by state Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford=
)=20
and a $409-million measure by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego),=
=20
contain a dizzying range of financial "carrots" designed to help people cut=
=20
power use.
?????There is $50 million to help low- and moderate-income consumers replac=
e=20
energy-wasting appliances such as old refrigerators with new, more=20
energy-efficient equipment, $60 million to help consumers replace older=20
lighting systems, $7 million to teach school children about energy=20
efficiency, and $50 million for electricity meters for businesses.
?????The Senate bill won final passage on a 31-6 vote; the Assembly bill=20
cleared the Legislature on a 55-15 vote. However, not everyone supported th=
e=20
concept of government subsidies to reduce power use.
?????Meanwhile, utility watchers issued gloomy reports early Thursday,=20
helping to drag down the stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp.,=20
parent corporations of the beleaguered utilities. Edison closed at $12.64 p=
er=20
share, down 34 cents or 2.6%, while PG&E fell to $11.38 per share, down 27=
=20
cents or 2.3%, on the New York Stock Exchange.
?????Standard & Poor's said it is unlikely that Southern California Edison=
=20
and Pacific Gas & Electric will regain a sound credit rating soon. The Wall=
=20
Street debt-rating firm lowered the utilities' credit rating to high-risk=
=20
junk-bond status in January when they began defaulting on debt.
?????Standard & Poor's cited a lack of action by Davis and state legislator=

electricity costs. Banks and other creditors will run out of patience befor=

?????You wouldn't think of this dilemma as a key part of California's=20

By embracing a rate increase lower than the PUC's, Davis tried to portray=

himself politically as a leader, but he also put himself in jeopardy should=

Last week, the PUC approved a rate increase that would average 40 percent.=
=20
That includes making permanent a temporary 10 percent average increase=20

Davis also would make that average 10 percent increase permanent.=20
The PUC's rate would lift the customer's price per kilowatt by about 3 cent=

"Gov. Davis blamed everyone but himself tonight," said Harvey Rosenfeld,=20
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.=20

The remainder of the debt would be erased by the state's purchase of the PG=

$14 billion to cover power purchases, said John Stevens, Davis' top energy=

All of this can be in a smaller rate increase because the governor's office=

Davis, but one widely seen as necessary.=20
The Democratic governor had come under increasing pressure to take decisive=

"The governor clearly has the authority to ask the PUC to do something."=20
Davis said he opposed the increase at the time, and denied having any=20

In his speech, Davis "urged" the PUC to consider the plan.=20

Sacramento -- After a long day of haggling, both houses of the Legislature=
=20
yesterday approved a $1.1 billion package of energy conservation measures=
=20
designed to cut California electricity use as quickly as possible.=20
Much of the money goes to existing state programs offering loans, grants an=
d=20
cash to business, agricultural, residential and low-income ratepayers. Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis is expected to sign the bills.=20
Programs include rebates on new refrigerators and air conditioners, as well=
=20
as grants to place reflective surfaces on roofs and replace traffic lights=
=20
with energy-efficient bulbs and weatherize homes.=20
"These are well-known programs," said state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto,=
=20
author of one of the bills in the package. "They have been very effective."=
=20
Lawmakers were divided over which consumers should get the most assistance,=
=20
and fights flared between urban and rural lawmakers over the size of=20
assistance to agricultural interests.=20
The final compromise gives the bulk of the money to the Public Utilities=20
Commission and the California Energy Commission, which administer a host of=
=20
conservation programs.=20
One-fifth of the $1.1 billion is devoted to programs helping the state's=20
poorest consumers.=20
Of the $240 million in low-income aid, $100 million will go to subsidize up=
=20
to 25 percent of gas or electric bills in low-income households.=20
A poor household is defined as one that is below 150 percent of the federal=
=20
poverty level -- roughly a family of four earning $25,000.=20
The program, known as California Alternate Rates for Energy, is administere=
d=20
by the utilities and paid for by $180 million in surcharges on other=20
consumers' bills. The $100 million will go to expand the program.=20
An additional $120 million is pegged for a program that helps households=20
below 60 percent of the state median income -- $33,000 for a family of four=
.=20
The program offers subsidies and grants for home-energy efficiencies like=
=20
insulation, weather-stripping and low-flow shower heads.=20
Among the other programs receiving more money:=20
-- $50 million to beef up new air conditioner and refrigerator rebate=20
programs run by local utilities.=20
-- $50 million in 3 percent loans to replace inefficient display=20
refrigerators like the ones that hold drinks in mini-marts, liquor stores o=
r=20
convenience stores.=20
-- $60 million to municipal utilities like those in Sacramento, Alameda and=
=20
Palo Alto to expand their conservation efforts.=20
-- $10 million for cities and counties to replace stoplights with energy=20
efficient light-emitting diodes or LEDs.=20
-- $35 million in grants to businesses that recoat the roofs of their low-=
