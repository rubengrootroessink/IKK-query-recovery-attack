Happy New Year and thanks again for your support on the Arena Prop.

A consulting group that I have worked with over the last 10 years in
California tells me there may be an initiative in 2002 (March or November)
to undo electric deregulation there.  This group is Woodward & McDowell.
They specialize in propositions.

In 2000, Baselice & Associates polled in their success efforts to defeat
Prop 25 (march) and pass Prop 35 (nov).  I highly recommend that any
coalition formed to defeat a proposition in California contact Woodward &
McDowell.  Call me if you would like to know more about them, or just call
Dave Fogarty at 650-340-0470.

Mike
