Melinda -

As always, we greatly appreciate your quick response to our emergencies.   As 
I mentioned earlier, Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz will be traveling to 
Japan on Monday and they will greatly benefit from this information.  Once 
again, the Corporate Security information in the Intranet has been extremely 
helpful.

Many thanks!
Nony Flores
