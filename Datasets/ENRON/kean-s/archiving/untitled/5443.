Hi all, 

1.? I have drafted an e-mail that should come from  John and should to go to 
the Board Members who have signed on to Energy for  California. This will go 
out with the attached information from Steve Lucas  about the legal/donation 
rules for the organization and the latest radio script  (Rick -please confirm 
this is it. We will re-name it.? Thanks).

Please confirm for me that all of the Board Members  agreed to write or raise 
$50,000.?
