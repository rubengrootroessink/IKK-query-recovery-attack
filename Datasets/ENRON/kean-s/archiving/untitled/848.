Gentlemen, we are in the final stages of development of the website. As you 
are aware, Anthony Dayao and I have been given the responsibility to develop 
the site. Anthony is generally responsible for the technical aspects, while I 
am covering the content. 

The content for the regulatory section (Japan Market) has now been finalized 
and final versions will be put onto the site shortly. In the meantime, I 
attach final versions in word format. The graphs for sections 1, 3 and 4 are 
set out in the attached excel spread sheet. 

  

We are aiming for site finalization by 13 October, Internal launch - 20 
October, public launch on 24 October and public announcement of the site on 
27 October  

The groups that we are looking for sign off from prior to 20 October are:

Legal - Alan Aronowitz/ Jane McBride
Public relations - Mark Palmer/ Jackie Gentle
Technical -  Corp. webmaster
Govt Affairs - Steve Kean/ Mark Schroeder
Commercial - Joe Hirl

I would be grateful if you could review the attached articles and let me know 
if you have any concerns or comments. You will see earlier drafts of the 
articles on the development site at  dev.enron.co.jp.

kind regards

Mark,

As foreshadowed last week, we gave a presentation to Mark Palmer this morning 
on the proposed Enron Japan website. Mark will be briefing Steve Kean 
tomorrow. We ran through a few background slides set out in the presentation 
and then went through the development site - dev.enron.co.jp. A copy of the 
presentation is attached.



In broad terms, we covered the following:

Why we are building the site
Who we are targeting
Reinforced that the site is commercially focused -  not brochure ware
Reinforced that the amount of material on the site is manageable and that we 
had procedures in place to regularly update the site
Sought ongoing support for new material.

I attach first drafts of articles which we propose including in the 
regulatory section . You can also view these articles in draft on the 
website  -  entry via the homepage pictures or in the Japan Market page.

 We clearly need to conform the graphs and recheck the facts and figures with 
a fine tooth comb. With that in mind, I would welcome your input on the 
content and the list of proposed future articles - set out on page 8 of the 
presentation.



We are proposing to have the website up and running by mid October with a 
view to launching the site to the public on 31 October, the date of the 
office opening. Between now and then we need to tidy up the drafts, translate 
them and then get sign off from PR, legal and Enron's web master.

I will try to give you a call  later today to briefly discuss.

kind regards
