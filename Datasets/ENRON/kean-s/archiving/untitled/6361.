FYI - Below are meeting notes from last week's Central Data Repository 
meeting.  

Summary.  
The challenge - there are many technical steps necessary to achieve a single 
data source for all of Enron.  Below are our team's immediate technical "To 
Do's".  
The good news - teams are continuing to work together to bring about a ONE 
Enron single source of data.

This note summarizes the discussion and decisions made in today's meeting.  
If your take on the meeting is different or if I have not accurately outlined 
the decisions, please let me know and I will correct the synopsis below.

1. Facilities room and work phone for Houston Headquarters personnel will be 
published in PeopleFinder and instructions will be provided on how to contact 
facilities to correct data if needed.  The verbage for these instructions 
will be developed with input from facilities.
2. The room and work phone in eHROnline will be display only for Houston 
Headquarters personnel and will show the room and phone on Infotype 1028 in 
SAP.  Instructions will be provided on how to contact facilities to correct 
data if needed.  Whether or not to make these fields display only in 
eHROnline can be determined by use of the SAP "z" table of Houston 
Headquarters personnel areas currently used in the paycheck distribution 
process.
3. SAP HR Houston will continue to process a nightly interface from 
facilities to update room and work number on Infotype 1028.  This interface 
can use either SS# or SAP ID.  The ISC will work with facilities to change 
the interface to use Apeture data when FMS is retired.
4. "Global Data" people located in Houston Headquarters who are entered into 
SAP in the new personnel area "Global Data" will have facilities data sent to 
PeopleFinder.  These folks will be able to provide facilities with an SAP ID 
instead of a SS# for entry into the facilities churn database.  
5.  Contractors and "Global Data" people who are not in SAP HR Houston will 
still be able to enter room and work phone in eHROnline.

For your reference, below is the original list of TO DO's from the 12/6/00 
meeting with regard to employee entered SAP data in eHROnline.  The above 
decision affects item 5.   

1. Proceed with the load of email and GIS# via the existing SAP I0105 
interface per the specifications provided on 11/16.  Tony Forrest will 
coordinate with the data mart team to work out processing details.  
ACTION ITEM FOR: Tony Forrest (coordinating with Data Mart Team)

2. Obtain cost estimate to provide for cell phone, fax and pager entry on a 
web page that will directly update SAP.  Exactly how the page should look and 
how to utilize the existing ESS transactions still needs to be finalized.  
Once implemented, perform a one-time conversion of eHROnline data into SAP. 
ACTION ITEM FOR: Kathy Schultea (eHROnline cost estimate)

3. Create an interim interface to keep "Known as" in sync between SAP and in 
the DataMart.   The issues which still need to be addressed here is how to 
keep the interface from overwritting changes entered in either eHROnline or 
in SAP. 
ACTION ITEM FOR: Tony Forrest  (coordinating  with Data Mart Team)

4. Since there is no current ESS functionality for employees to update this 
field, obtain a cost and time estimate for creating transactions direct entry 
into SAP by employees from an eHROnline web page. 
ACTION ITEM FOR: Geary Surratt (SAP cost estimate)/ Kathy Schultea (eHROnline 
cost estimate)

5. Meet with Steve Woods to work out the process to publish FMS data, allow 
employees to enter corrections which will be published until they move to a 
new phone, location, and publish new rooms/phone numbers from FMS upon 
processing a churn, whether or not the employee has entered a correction.
ACTION ITEM FOR: Geary Surratt/Kathy Schultea
