Attached are the BGE filings at the US District Court in Baltimore.  They are 
seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, both of which were summarily 
rejected by Judge Matsch in Denver, who is treating CSU's claim as an APA 
review. They are also making virtually identical legal claims as CSU - their 
central claim is that they have the exclusive right to operate electric and 
gas systems inside Fort Meade. BGE has also brought in the issue of state 
jurisdiction over other entities such as EFSI:  they cite an opinion letter 
from the General Counsel of the MD PSC as an "official decision"  - which it 
is not.  In any case, Randy Rich and I had  subsequent meeting with GC 
regarding that letter in which she "clarified" her position in various 
respects contrary to BGE's claims.  But I see that aspect of BGE's complaint 
as favorable from our standpoint - the District Court can rule on this issue 
instead of the state courts.  Vicki/Andrew, please let me know how you want 
to proceed.  I have a few ideas that we could discuss with whomever handles 
the case as outside counsel.    -Bob 3-3180
