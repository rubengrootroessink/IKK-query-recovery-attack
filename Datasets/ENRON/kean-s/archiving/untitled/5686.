Subject: Revised draft attributes paper



Please see attached.

We have tried to develop five basic market objectives, show why these
critical given Enron's strategic position, and describe some of the market
attributes that follow from the positions. I think these attributes will
lead directly to (at least our) proposed "ideal" RTO structure.

We can cut down some of the background discussion if you wish to circulate
it to any other audiences within the company. But I wanted you guys to have
a sense of where we are coming from with respect to some of the conclusions.

Unless instructed otherwise I will continue to circulate documents only to
the two of you, and you can forward to others as you see fit.
