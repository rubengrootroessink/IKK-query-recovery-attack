Teh rest of the parts for Phil's PC arrived today.  I'll build it over the
weekend and test it for a couple of days before I send it to him.  The
monitor is being shipped directly to him via mom & dad.  I sent our old PC
to Kathy today.  she should have it next week.  I set up a free internet
access account for her and her email address is kat.wedig@netzero.net (kat
stands for Kathy, Alan, and Timothy).

Phil's PC will be a PIII 600 with 128 mgs of ram and a 30 GB hard drive -if
you care about the details.  It should be a while before he outgrows this
one.  I got a great deal on the parts - I'll add them up and let you know
what it cost (nobody needs to payme until Phil's bd)

VIVA BUSH!
