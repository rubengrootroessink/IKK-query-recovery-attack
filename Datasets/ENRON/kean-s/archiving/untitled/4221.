Last year the Enron PAC launched a campaign to become a million dollar PAC.=

Enron employees responded and the PAC reached its objective, putting it on=

With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE, one time contributions whi=

The PAC needs your help.  Please join.  If you are already a member, please=

consider increasing your commitment.

Every year Enron deals with dozens of issues pending before hundreds of sta=

several key legislative battles affecting our domestic and international=20
businesses:

[Elizabeth is compiling a list - suggestions appreciated]

We face old and new opportunities and challenges this year:

? Efforts to regulate derivative instruments
? Federal electric industry restructuring legislation

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =
they=20

that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today =01) and please consider=
