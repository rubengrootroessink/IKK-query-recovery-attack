One of the things I'd like to talk about next week is setting up a process to 
funnel requests for Ken's time through ( Jeff andf Joe also), so that we're 
forwarding to him consensus  high priority requests. Thanks.

Subject: OECD Meetings June 26-28, Paris

Ken: While in Europe last week I arranged a meeting with Douglas Worth, 
Secretary General of the Business Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) to the 
OECD. Doug headed the Washington office of IBM until he retired a few years 
ago, then joined Carla Hills firm and two years ago became Secretary General 
of the BIAC. During his Washington service for IBM he headed up the Trade 
Committee of the United States Council for International Business to which we 
have long been a member. 

Doug and I discussed the promotion of energy services and he had several 
suggestions which I found to be excellent. He is a top level person who 
recommends policy to the OECD. He suggested that he would like to organize a 
meeting with you briefing OECD ministers and senior staff on business plans 
of today, changes in the market place and what is necessary to advance a 
business in today's atmosphere. Doug believes that having such a high level 
briefing advances the cause of business and competitive policies which is the 
priority of the OECD.

He also called my attention to the OECD Forum 2000 to be held June 26-28 in 
Paris. Doug has offered to contact Dennis Lamb, another former Washingtonian 
in the diplomatic service who is arranging the program and if you are 
available he would ask that you be a primetime speaker. It covers the type of 
issues that you addressed at the WTO in Seatlle and the World Economic Forum 
in Davos.  (I would dearly love to have a few minutes briefing from you on 
your Davos appearances).

I think these presentations at the OECD, one a private luncheon with 
Ministers that Doug thinks would be an informal presentation and the 
possibility of a slot on the June 26-28 program would be excellent for our 
cause and hope that your schedule either in June or later can accommodate 
this opportunity.

Joe

PS: Doug and his eco-staff director Ms. Hanne Rosenbaum (she knows and has 
worked with John Palmisano) told me that one of their main themes this year 
is eco-efficiency which seems to fit our Enron goals.
