Information Management Weekly Milestones Report =01) 02/09/01



Portal.=20
Portal development work continues for respective BU/FUs under Joe Wong's=20
direction.  This work is based on information collected from portal surveys=
. =20
Brandon Rigney's team committed to delivering the portal graphical treatmen=
t=20
by 2/16/01.  A new portal name is being discussed.  The decision for the=20
portal "look and feel" and the portal name will be made next week.  A=20
"progress before perfection" approach is planned for releasing the portal.

"Killer" or "sticky" applications for the new portal are being identified a=
nd=20
prioritized.  All task force members are required to identify five "killer"=
=20
or "sticky" applications by next week's IM Task Force meeting.

Some features of Hewlitt Packard's benchmark portal are being discussed and=
=20
targeted for development. =20

Tibco 2.0 version targeted as a requirement to provide personalized color=
=20
treatments for portal.  Allen Elliott to confirm licensing agreement for=20
Tibco 2 is in place.

Single sign-on capability will require changes to the producer portal=20
applications.  The single sign-on security task force has developed and=20
proposed a strategy to make this happen.  The portal development is working=
=20
this issue to ensure the eventual release of a single sign-on entry point f=
or=20
the portal.

Philippe Bibi was provided a project update.  Philippe re-emphasized the ne=
ed=20
to unveil a best practices portal that is simple, wanted by users, and=20
value-added for users. =20

UDM/ESE.=20
Inktomi and Verity appear to be the choice contenders.  Since Autonomy=20
requires an obtrusive amount of work on individual employees, interview=20
results predict users would not support this product type.  Consequently, t=
he=20
task force does not expect to pilot Autonomy.

Business Analyst Paul Timberlake collected high level pricing for each=20
vendor.  Below is a table of that information.  Paul is working with GSS's=
=20
Peter Goebel to gain additional pricing support. Note, Paul's final report=
=20
will have extensive licensing information for each vendor.=20

Vendor=09Initial Cost=09Annual Support & Maintenance
Autonomy=09$3,000,000=09$540,000 / year support
Inktomi=09$1,375,000=09$206,250 / year support
Verity=09$682,500
=09($487,500  +  $162,500 + $32,500)=09$130,000 / year support


IM Strategy Proposal.
Steve Kean attended the weekly IM Task Force meeting to get an update on th=
e=20
IM Strategy Proposal.  Although the task force was suggesting an executive=
=20
point person be identified, Steve reminded the task force of the value of=
=20
grassroots efforts.  The task force will remain focused on identifying and=
=20
developing sticky portal applications to improve the flow of information=20
which ultimately should increase the flow of revenue.  Steve's message to I=
M=20
Task Force:  do what it takes to make it happen.

During the discussion with Steve, the task force reviewed HP's best practic=
es=20
portal.  Steve would like to view the HP demonstration of their best=20
practices portal. =20

The Task Force team met with EES' Knowledge Management team to discuss a ON=
E=20
Enron approach to information management.  EES emphasized need for executiv=
e=20
management to encourage BU/FU IM/KM coordination.
