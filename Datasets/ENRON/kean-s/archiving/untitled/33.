This could be the Big Bang.  We need to be prepared for media.

Market Participants:

Be advised that there is a strong possibility that there will be 1000-3000MW
of firm load curtailed this afternoon.  In addition to ongoing issues
related to gas prices, some participants are now indicating that they cannot
sell into the markets due to credit concerns.

We are taking a number of actions to remedy the supply shortage, including
work with State and Federal government representatives.
