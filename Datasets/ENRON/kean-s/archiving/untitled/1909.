I am counting on  you NOT to share this with anyone.  Diomedes has seen it 
but David has not, and you never know if you are on the right track with 
David.  Again, I do not advocate the Diomedes version if that is our strategy.

Kelly:

Please email me the draft of the office of Chairman.  I'd like to have 
something concrete in mind (I don't intend to share a copy) when I talk to 
Jeff - - by the way, he's out this week on spring break with his kids.
