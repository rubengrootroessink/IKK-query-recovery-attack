Vanessa:

 Upon further review of Stan's business schedule, he has decided against 
attending the April 11 meeting, as his calendar is just really full!   He 
does still plan to attend the dinner on April 10.   Would you please amend 
the attendee list to reflect this, and if Mr. Lay or Mr. Skilling have a 
problem with Stan not attending the meeting on the 11th, please let us know.

Thanks,
Cindy
