----------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Energy Central Deregulation Public Forum Question is a feature of
* Energy Central's Competition and Deregulation Topic Center. Find this
* week's question and the previous questions and answers by pointing your
* browser to:
* http://www.energycentral.com/sections/surveys/

**********************************************************************
* NEW QUESTION (respond to dereg-forum@energycentral.com):
*
Although natural gas is used to make only 25% of the electricity
generated in the U.S., almost 95% of all power plants planned for
the future are expected to be fired by natural gas. However, shortages
caused by cutbacks in exploration budgets and restrictions on where
new drilling can occur have analysts predicting gas prices this winter
will be the highest they've ever been. Should there be a change in
policy to encourage exploration and production of natural gas on
federal lands and the continental shelf to help meet future demand
requirements?

SELECTED RESPONSES:


  I have been following the California story for some time. I have
consulted with CA utilities over the past 9 years and have spent
considerable time examining the recent events and their history. I
believe each and every person that reviewed and approved
California's deregulation should be required to go back to school
and take Economics 101. I don't believe the AG in California will
find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to
control the weather - and raise temperatures 10-15 degrees above
normal.  There is no significant baseline power in California. The
consumers, regulators and politicians in California that have been
pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the
flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics.
  The regulators in California, the NE part of the country, and
elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the 1980's and early 1990's.
We now are asking the same agencies, if not the same individuals,
that created the mess to fix it. Talk about the fox watching the hen
house, but its even better. The fox built a hen house and is being
asked to fix the problem now that we're noticing chickens are
missing.
  Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket, when demand
increases dramatically and supply is limited.  If you cap prices,
you'll almost certainly create shortages. I would have hoped we
would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist
rule in Russia. Can you say "RATIONING"?  Almost everyone has been
misled to believe electric prices will decline under "competition"
without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of
the electric industry compared to other "deregulated industries."
If you want your power at prices below those a free market will
support, be prepared to go without your electricity at times.
  After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other
deregulated industries, you will discover that in a "fully"
deregulated electric industry, retail electric prices will average
from 10 to 20 percent higher than existing prices. And prices will
reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during
demand spikes.

----------------------------------------------------

  The answer is Yes and No.
  Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last 6
months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity.
  However, those price increases do not cover the full extent of the
increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric.  My
sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major
IPPs servicing SDG&E which accounts for some of the other increases.
  SDG&E's mismanagement accounts for the rest.
  Carl R. Clark, President, Energetech Corp.
  cclark@energetech.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas
increased? Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if
the price of sugar or rice increased?
  The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch
between supply and demand.
  The consumers' concerns about this issue should be heard by
suppliers in the form of new peaking power units, cogeneration,
combined-cycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of
existing generating plants.
  If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue,
new suppliers will do so.
  "Market forces" work well enough in other sectors; they will work in
CA given time.
  David Whitehead, VP Sales - GENTRACK, Sanderson Computers

----------------------------------------------------

  The generators are closely following the rules set by the
independent system operator.  The solution would be to have the
consumers educated enough to demand, and pay for, a service that
provides them consistent pricing - this would be a niche for a
service provider to go to the generators and capture enough
generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands.
One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the
average price of electricity over a longer period, say the entire
year.  In addition, as I recall, during the transition period, the
ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates.
  Gary Hilberg, Vice President - Business Development, The PIC
  Energy Group
  ghilberg@picworld.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Competition is as competition does, usually with little thinking or
planning involved.  Some of us in California tried to bring various
forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public
eyes on thoughts on the future.   But scenarios of belief in the
grow-and-build era of the 60s-70s tended to over-forecast load
growth for nuclear power (7%a year), just as it was logical for
management to believe in low forecasts for the 90s (2% a year) in
the deregulation era.
  The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying "feet in ice and
hand in fire," i.e., the average temperature is pretty comfortable.
  Was AB 1890 a good thing?  No value judgement, it was a political
deal for $28 billion.  Remember Diablo Canyon.  Some CEOs and public
officials made their careers on this sort of thinking.
  Best wishes California, hopefully there will be light in the night
skies.   Place blame appropriately.

  Is this question a joke?  Of course they are. This behavior will
continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs'
shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets.
These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a
competitive market and will do anything to keep the "fat, dumb, and
happy" mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage
exploitation on deregulation.
  Randy Castleberry, CEO, Tempulse Information Management
  randy@tempulse.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not
the question and price caps are certainly not the answer.  The main
problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation
is the result of 2 years of deregulation, not the 100 years of
regulation that led to shortages of both generation and
transmission.  In addition, one must remember that the vast majority
of generation remains under regulatory and/or legislated prices --
only about 10% is actually "bid" and cleared; no wonder the market
thinness has lead to volatility.  Second price auction certainly
doesn't help, since everybody gets paid whatever (the one
manipulating?) is the highest bidder's bid.  Price caps will only
stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the
answer to price volatility.  The other half is meaningful demand
responsive behavior -- price caps will hide true costs from
consumers and stifle that too.  A little more patience is what's
needed.

  Oh sure, why not -- it worked for the phone companies, right,
well, didn't it?
  Okay.  Admittedly they're making over twenty-percent returns on
investments, but you've never heard about a phone brownout, have
you? ;)
  David Draper, Regulatory Analyst, Florida Public Commission
  DDraper@PSC.STATE.FL.US

----------------------------------------------------

  Power marketers (and utilities with generating capacity to sell and
traders to sell it) are not manipulating the market, just taking
advantage of the opportunities it is offering.  That's what a
market, unfettered by regulation, is about.  The answer to your
second question, then, is that price caps are clearly re-regulation
and anti-free market.  We either deregulate or re-regulate the
electric industry.
  Reginald Ankrom, President, EnNova Energy Solutions
  rankrom@rnet.com

----------------------------------------------------

  You reap what you sow.  CA rushed into deregulation without a
complete review of the impact.  Market value means profit and any
company, to remain in business, looks at the profit motive as the
primary driving force.
  Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of
guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation.
  The current system, like all systems in the past, will eventually
self correct.  Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau.  It
may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will
work it out.
  The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in
everything we have done.  From complete isolationism prior to WWII
to complete globalization in the 1950s and 1960s; from no
environmental controls to (what some people may consider excessive)
tight controls.
  I wish us a happy future.

  If coal is the least expensive fuel, install two used coal-fired
steam generators (boilers), each capable of supplying turbo-
generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load.
  As an alternative, install used boilers capable of burning waste
fuel to supply the turbo-generators; free fuel is a very good price.
San Diego can surely issue the various permits?
  Sell any surplus power, so the residents of San Diego can enjoy
free electricity, i.e., generate for 3 cents/KWh and sell it for 6.
  I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available?

  Market manipulation, no. Taking advantage of a somewhat silly
demand/supply imbalance situation, yes. The analogy that comes to
mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are
doing okay, so he can charge more for them. (We should remember that
this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where
supply exceeds demand.)
  A few additional points:
  1. The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes. What
about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDG&E
ratepayers got in the winter and spring?
  2. Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve
the California market, things may get uglier before they get better.
Then again, maybe Mr. Greenspan's interest rate hikes finally will
begin to take effect.
  3. Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot
market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the
New York area.
  4. How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some
additional generating and transmission capacity approved?
  5. Don't count out DSM completely yet (at least for peak-shaving).
  Phil Sisson, N/A, Sisson and Associates, Inc.
  pasisson@mcgi.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Price spikes in California, as in other parts of the country, are a
sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or
competitive.  In the specific case of California, the reasons for
this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the
market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to
control it.
  Cal-ISO's creation of the government-granted monopoly known as the
PX or power exchange helped to ensure that California's market could
never truly be efficient.  Many of California's generators are
forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the
development of a true, robust bilateral market for wholesale
electricity.  The introduction of further price caps not only
discourages power marketers from short-term sales into the state in
times of need, but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage
long-term entry as well as the development of independent generation.
  California needs real, robust competition -- not another step deeper
into the regulatory morass that they have created.
  Kevin O'Donovan, Director, Government Affairs, Industry Networks
  kmodonovan@hotmail.com

----------------------------------------------------

  I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high,
and at times higher, than southern California. Generators are
withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets
where they can sell, not in local service areas.    Why else would
generation be reduced "for economic reasons"?  Once again
opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for
a very small group.  The concept of deregulation was to enhance
competition through freedom of choice of the end user, NOT THE
SUPPLIER.  We are a captive audience.  Try to get by for just one
day without use of electricity.    When price controls were removed,
generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever
level they wanted.  There is not one single fuel source used by
medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of  $250 per MWh.
  A solution would be to cap prices, not at a fixed level, but at a
cost of service (fuels, maintenance, labor, etc.) plus a maximum
allowable profit margin.  Also, require generators to run regardless
of economics.  Under the "must run" would be a requirement to
satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power
outside of local service territories.  Let's get away from pricing
based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based
on cost of service.  Let the electric industry face the same
economic problems as the rest of industry.

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe that the current, deregulated, marketing infrastructure
invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because
the new laissez-faire market has no real constraints.  The new
arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are
living well by adding no value to the commodity...only extra cost to
the end user.  The trend of abuse is clear and I think price
ceilings are inevitable.
  Roy (Chip) Burton, Project Engineer, Multi-Level Technologies, Inc.

----------------------------------------------------

  As a market moves up the supply curve on peak, there is no doubt that there
is more supplier concentration, and the potential for market manipulation.
However, price caps are not a satisfactory long-term solution to high
prices. They will inevitably lead to blackouts. A better long-term solution
will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to
new peaking and base load generation, particularly distributed generation,
that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads.
  Peter Evans, Senior Vice President, Catalytica Combustion Systems
  PEvans@mv.catalytica-inc.com

----------------------------------------------------

  The two-part question goes first to motive, then to solution.
  No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system, versus
the system is working as it should.  The fact is that the result of
operating the open market system as presently designed is
unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market
in California is supposed to, and attempting to, operate in a
condition of supply-demand-price equilibrium that does not exist.
That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to
support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators
and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those
currently lining their pockets. That price caps are needed in this
ineffective or, as some people laughingly call it, imperfect market
goes without question. That generators or marketers cannot make a
buck at a $250 per MWh cap is laughable. This is five times more
than consumers ever paid for energy.
  The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps
should remain in effect. That answer should depend on when the
promised market-in-equilibrium can be brought to bear, and when a
workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for
California consumers.
  Otherwise, re-regulate. At any cost, it will be cheaper than where
we're heading.
  Joe Bongiovanni, General Manager, Hardwick Electric Department
  Joebhed@aol.com

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full
picture regarding deregulation of electric rates.  They were
proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of
competition, and on a yearly basis this is still possible.
  (1) Electricity was already high in California because of the
environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants.
  (2) Very few new plants are being built, and a perfectly good
plant at San Onofre (Unit 1) was shut down reducing our resource margins.
  (3) Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in
a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most
expensive unit on line.
  (4) Today, no one is talking about what happens during the low
demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very
high driving the price down to the point that some plants will
probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line.
  Thus, the situation of a free market system for electricity is not
good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power
producers that can make money only when demand is very high. It will
take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive
market for electricity.
  Bill Hannaman, P.E., Senior Staff Engineer, DS&S
  hannamang@ds-s.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Don't blame this situation on the market players - a utility
without generation is like a race car without tires. Until
investors, customers, and employees stand as one against utilities
selling off all their generation, this situation will continue to be
one of simple market economics (supply vs. demand). The only winners
are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the
high sale prices of the plants, while customers are exposed to
higher prices and lower reliability and, sadly, employees lose jobs,
pay level, and seniority that are hard, if not impossible, to replace.
  Frank Richards, Technical Sales Rep., Austin Energy
  Frank.Richards@austinenergy.com

----------------------------------------------------

  IF there is manipulation of prices, price caps are not the way to
penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single
seller, not the individual or handful of individuals who are
restraining the market and acting against the public interest. I do
tend to believe that price runups in California today aren't due to
market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory
neglect (and complacency bordering on hubris) CA has labored under
for the past 15 years (with no new plants being built while domestic
demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank).
  Returning to price caps, isn't it fairly simple to illustrate that
the California caps have served to do the following:  normal sellers
of power sell at x.  Let's say there are nefarious actors who
withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices, of
x + 10, rather than the market rate of x + 1 that would have arisen
as demand increased and supply tightened.  This is crude but bear
with me.  In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap
of x - 10, which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately
penalizes all of the other actors in the market, slam dunking them
in order to stop the few bad actors. Results:
  All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that
the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their
investment, are now penalized by caps that shave off money from
their profit-making times in the market, for what is so far an
unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors.  So how
many will want to build in this "market," with this new and highly
volatile form of risk?
  And, what California accomplished for fifteen years through
regulatory neglect, it will now persist to accomplish through
political intemperance.  Putting caps onto the market will not solve
shortages, it will not solve price problems, more plants will not be
built, transmission won't be built, reliability will get worse.
California is in for many more years of problems if they don't put
their energy problems in order.
  What is with California and price controls?  First President Richard
Nixon, who imposed national wage and price controls which failed
miserably, had to be pulled off because they only hid, not solved,
problems that continued to fester, and contributed greatly to the
inflation of the later 1970s.  Now price caps, which will do about
the same.

----------------------------------------------------

  The "Electric Wholesale Market" and "Deregulation" in general is
primarily in name only.  One of the regional issues is the allowance
of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production
in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase
wholesale production under non-regulated entities in the same
electrical region.  Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic
ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product,
while also owning non-regulated regional wholesale production of the
product, begs for market problems.   Placing caps on the wholesale
price of the product not only masks the real issues, but also could
prevent the entrance of new participants.
  Anonymous, Senior Domestic Marketing Manager, N/A
  N/A

----------------------------------------------------

  Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain
higher profits in San Diego?  Of course they are -- the bidding
rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers
receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected.
  Thus, there is a tremendous profit-making incentive to withhold
power until the price goes up.
  But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem.  The whole
premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big
lie.  Why?  As economist Eugene Coyle explains in "Price
Discrimination, Electronic Redlining, And Price Fixing in
Deregulated Electric Power" (Washington, DC: American Public Power
Association), a commodity product with high fixed costs will force
producers to discriminate between customers, to collude with each
other to maintain profits, and to merge to eliminate competitors.
The best examples are the airlines, which charge different prices
between leisure and business customers, who collude through their
ticketing computers, and who have merged into four or so major
carriers (and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to
about two or three).  The same is now happening in deregulated
 electricity.
  Many will argue that electricity competition hasn't been given a
fair chance.  However, even if you believe that competition can
somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs, who
will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale
markets, which will require true open access to the transmission
system?  Enron, the loudest promoter of open access, just got its
butt kicked by the big investor-owned utilities, which have proved
their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation.
And the big for-profit holding companies are very strong at the
state level as well.
  So, just as we have been saying for more than four years,
deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies, because of
the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself, and
because no one has the political power to enact the structural
reforms needed to overcome the power of the for-profit holding
companies that still completely dominate this industry.

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe the answer to the question is NO!  The problem is lack
of supply during peak demand periods.  The cry for re-regulation is
ludicrous.  Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of
wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price
signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and
innovate new forms of supply and demand side management.  And this
is precisely what is occurring.
  Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas
has at least doubled in the last several months, the electric supply
from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer
run-offs that supply the extensive hydro system, an unplanned
nuclear plant outage, as well as very hot weather covering the
entire West Coast.  All of the combined events have contributed to
the current problems faced in the West and, more specifically,
southern California.  Is anyone complaining, when during light load
periods, the price of power is low and at times almost zero?  Would
"regulation" have changed any of this?  I fail to see how.  As long
as consumption goes unchecked and the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY)
prevails when companies propose additional new generation and
transmission facilities, we will continue to have high prices during
peak demand. While the above is a simplification of the problems
being faced in the West, these are some of the basic issues that
need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been
implemented or not.

----------------------------------------------------

  Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes
and price caps now just prolong the pain.  The state of California's
actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of
politically motivated interference in the free market that will
ultimately harm consumers.  The price caps tarnish the allure of
investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for
electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively.  How many lotto
tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a $3
million prize is too extravagant?  Would reducing lotto winnings to
$1,000 make it a better producer of state revenue?
  There are market-based forwards, derivatives and other mechanisms
for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes
caused by summer supply shortages.
  The long-term answer is to let the market provide financial rewards
To those who take risk to build generating capacity.  When enough new
generators join in, the market will reach equilibrium.
  Eric C. Williams, Market Solutions Analyst, EPRI Market Solutions
  ewilliam@epri.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based
on capacity limits, then capping market rates confuses the situation
by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the
availability of alternative supply sources.
  The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its
comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa
1935. Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than
a few years. In the meantime, dealing with system peak loads is
where attention should be focused.  Reregulation and wholesale
market caps on prices harken back to the old system.  It's time to
begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively.
