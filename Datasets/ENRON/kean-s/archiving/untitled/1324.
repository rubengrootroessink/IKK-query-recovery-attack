 Oruru- the Bolivian Superintendence of Hydrocarbons fined Transredes 
$114,000 for failing to conduct proper maintenance to the OSSA-2 pipeline

The  Parotani and Chorety river oil spills have been cleaned up.  At Chorety

analytical tests.  Bolivian regulatory agency visited the Parotani site and 
found additional 
contamination.  A crew was sent to clean up the newly found contamination.  
Transredes at the request of the Bolivian Forestry Department planted 350 
trees in
 this area.
