Effective April 2, EnFile has been moved to a new server. If you are an 
EnFile user, you will have to upgrade your Netscape plugin, or you will be 
unable to access  EnFile. If you are not an EnFile user, please disregard 
this message.

Attached below are two different files, Communicator.exe and Navigator.exe. 
If you are using Netscape Communicator, you will need to use 
Communicator.exe. If you are using Netscape Navigator, you will need to use 
Navigator.exe.

To upgrade your computer:

1. Double-click on the appropriate attachment.
2. Click "Launch" in the window that will pop up.
3. You will be presented with a WinZip dialog box. Click "Unzip", and the 
upgraded plugin will be installed on your computer.
4. Click "OK" in the confirmation dialog box.
5. Click "Close" in the WinZip dialog box to exit. 

If you experience problems, please contact Tech Support at 1-888-853-9797.
