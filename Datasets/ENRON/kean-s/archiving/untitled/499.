GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS

RioGen/Eletrobolt PPs (Brazil)- Joe Kolb arranged a meeting to discuss=20
rerouting the pipeline. The consensus was that the orphanage/school must be=

operator, and Enron 20%. The due diligence has already been conducted. =20
Before the deal completed RAC review, Massey had a major spill of coal=20
slurry, resulting in contamination of surface waters and intake systems in=
=20
northern Kentucky.  Susan Worthen was contacted by RAC to evaluate the=20
potential cost of cleanup with Massey's estimation of damages and if they=
