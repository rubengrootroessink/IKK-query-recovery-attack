Attached is NARUC's letter opposing the MidAmerican transmission compromise.  
In addition, by mail, I have forwarded to you Southern Company's lobbying 
piece to also oppose the MidAmerican transmission compromise.  Chairman 
Murkowski told Ken Lay he would only support the compromise language if NARUC 
supported the language.  Well, we now have the answer.  We are lining up 
sponsors for our amendment package with Senators Bingaman and Fitzgerald 
agreeing to be lead sponsors plus others willing to cosponsor including 
Gorton and Nickles.  Staff confusion and locking down the exact amendment 
language are our immediate challenges now.  We do not expect the mark-up to 
conclude in the Senate Energy Committee tomorrow, thus, giving us time to 
pass our amendment package upon Congress' return from the Memorial Day break.
