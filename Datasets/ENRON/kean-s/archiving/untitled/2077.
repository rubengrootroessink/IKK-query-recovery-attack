I am planning to organize a kick-off meeting in Houston on January the 18th 
in the morning (8:30 to 11:00).  Please let me know if you will be able to 
attend or if the majority of you have conflicts with your agenda please we 
will reschedule the meeting.  Let me know how this date works for you.

What I would like to do that day is to present to all of you a first draft of 
a concept of what we want to achieve.  We will then discuss if and how we can 
achieve our objectives and finally we will come out of the meeting with a 
work plan with responsibilities for everyone.

Before that meeting (lets say by January the 12th) I would like everyone of 
you to send me some information about you in one page so that we can 
distribute it among the group so that we all know who everyone else is.  
Remember, this is the information resources group, we must be informed:

For example
Name:
Position/report :
Responsibilities:
Prior Experience:
Education:
Reason for you to be in the group: or how you think you can contribute 
something to the group

I am sure that with the committed participation of all of you,  we will 
accomplish our goals and develop Information and Knowledge tools to increase 
the productivity of our organization.

I am looking forward to meeting with all of you very soon.

Best regards,

Ricardo
