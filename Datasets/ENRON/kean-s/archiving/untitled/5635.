FYI. Joe's interview article was carried in the March edition of "Energy 
Forum", a well-known magazine in the Japanese energy industry. The interview 
was done in early February. The March edition has a special feature issue 
focusing on financial technology - entitled "Energy Big Bang and Financial 
Big Bang".
