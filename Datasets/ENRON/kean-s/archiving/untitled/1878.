It means that some people hear what they want to hear.  Michael Miller has 
been asked to complete the work on the IM because we are going to need that 
information at some point anyway.  Frank sees a far different process for the 
North, while I foresee another big effort, but with a sale of the North in 
smaller chunks.  Stay tuned....

Subject: Employee memo

Gentlemen--here is the revised draft of the all-employee memo that we could 
send from the Office of the Chairman.  Since Diomedes and David aren't 
pushing this, I'd rather just keep it in reserve right now rather than keep 
it moving.  (I am not sending this latest version to them.)  Mark, for your 
info I am including the version that Diomedes and I have tentatively agreed 
on that he would send to his region as well.

I am getting mixed signals on NoCal.  Michael Miller says he is still working 
on their IM, yet today Frank Stabler said that he doesn't want the news clips 
any more due to their "change in status".  What does this mean?
