Steve:  I want to thank you for recently creating the new Environment Health 
& Safety division.  I think the reorganization and dedicated focus will 
benefit the entire company.  I know that in the past I was often critical of 
the previous situation, and while I didn't necessarily enjoy complaining 
about it I thought it was important to show you the inefficiencies of what we 
were experiencing.  

But what a difference Mike has made!  In just a few weeks he has met on an 
individual and group basis with key people involved in "environmental" 
issues.  He appears organized, and is doing a great job at sifting through 
the issues and prioritizing them.  He seems genuinley interested in working 
with us as a team to develop goals and is enthusiastic and supportive of our 
ideas and suggestions.  

We had a Clean Air Act meeting in DC this week which was well attended by our 
commercial people.  The Environment Health & Safety Council also met 
yesterday and I think finally, this group will do more than just talk.  
Everyone was very excited at the end of the day.  

Having said all of that, I also want to share some news with you.  Ed 
Baughman and Greg Woulfe asked me to join the emissions desk and yesterday I 
accepted the mid-marketer position which will report to Ed.  The timing is a 
little ironic, given the changes you just implemented but I am looking 
forward to some much-needed commercial experience. 

Without getting too sentimental, I want you to know that I have really 
enjoyed working for you and Rick.  I had no idea what I was getting myself 
into three years ago but it has turned out to be a very positive experience.  
Both of you are the architects of a valuable, powerful and exciting Govt. 
Affairs group.  What I will remember and appreciate most is the diverse, 
talented and respectful group of individuals that you have hired these past 
few years.  Everyone has been a pleasure to work with.  But most of all, you 
and Rick have challenged me, encouraged me and given me the freedom to learn 
about an industry that I knew nothing about  three years ago.  Thank you for 
taking a chance on me and making me a part of Enron.  

I know that I will be equally challenged as a mid-marketer and hopefully, if 
I crater, you and Rick will let me move back home.  Thanks again for 
everything.
