Meeting Details.

The above group met to discuss the content strategy for the KM Task Force=
=20
portal.  Our intention is to synergize the collective intelligence of these=
=20
teams to develop a best practices portal.  The task force is in a unique=20
position because the portal we will develop from is Bryan Powell=01,s=20
mynetwork.com which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigney=01,s=20
my.home.enron.com, it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the=
=20
KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members.  The question to ask is=
:=20
are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and=
=20
task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal? =20
Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can=
=20
determine what to include in a portal.=20

The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop.  What is more=
=20
important and challenging is the process, established perhaps by a=20
centralized KM effort, by which information or content is made available to=
=20
all given portals. It is the content accessible through a portal which=20
determines the success of the portal.  Yahoo.com users, through a minimal=
=20
number of starting points, may access some 6000 containers of information. =
=20
For our project, it has not been determined what information (what content)=
=20
needs to be accessed from a portal.  The answer to this question should=20
predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial=
=20
dashboard of the portal. =20

Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what=20
specific content to make available through the portal?  No, we have neither=
=20
the time nor the responsibility to undertake this.  But, how then, does the=
=20
task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don=01=
,t=20
have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access? =
=20
The requirements phase should predict this.

What is most challenging about content?  The answer:  locking down the=20
containerable information (content) to bridge to portals.  Information need=
s=20
to be syndicated.  In order for it to be syndicated, it must be in an=20
appropriate container.  =01&Containerable=018 information is information th=
at can=20
be shown as a channel.  In other words, containerable information is=20
information that can be accessed from the portal.  Not all information on a=
=20
given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals. =20
Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained. =
 A=20
KM strategy should propose a method to identify, develop and maintain=20
information a portal can capture. =20


Meeting Conclusion.

The development of any business structure should be driven by business=20
needs.  Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and=
=20
person to person, the task of developing a portal as the single interface f=
or=20
all Enron Business Units is large. =20

Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to=20
develop the content strategy for a best practices portal. =20

Requirements Phase=09Design Phase=09Build Phase=09Test Phase =09Launch Phas=
e


We are currently in the requirements phase of this project.  Although=20
multiple, personalized portals have been developed, unveiled and implemente=
d,=20
we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal.  The=
=20
task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge=20
Management proposal.  In this proposal, we may consider the process through=
=20
which containerable information is identified, developed, and maintained.  =
In=20
the meantime, the content strategy team is available for the task force=20
members to consult.  The content strategy team will help Bryan Powell=01,s =
team=20
shape mynetwork.com.

With respect to content strategy, some of the responsibilities a KM proposa=
l=20
should review include:
? A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to=
=20
contain
? A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers
? A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers
? A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data
? A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites
? A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the =01&O=018 drive =
and=20
other assets
? A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby=
=20
specific needs of communities are identified and reflected in a best=20
practices portal
? A plan to develop a process for shutting off old channels (i.e. email fro=
m=20
Office of the Chairman) and turning on new channels (i.e. portal delivery o=
f=20
Office of the Chairman information)


Next Steps.

Identify content strategy =01&to do=01,s=018 for the requirements phase.
Identify owners of content strategy =01&to do=01,s=018 for the requirements=
 phase.
Establish weekly meetings for content strategy team.
Content strategy team members gain authorization from management to support=
=20
task force.
