The record high gas prices of this summer and fall and the questions
regarding supply adequacy for this winter have focused attention on
natural gas far beyond the confines of the direct market participants.
The national media, regulators, politicians, industrial groups, and
consumer advocates have all raised concerns about what will transpire
in terms of prices and availability this winter=01*and what can be done
about it. These conditions, however, are a culmination of trends that
have been developing in the gas market for five years or more; reversal
of these trends is likely to require more than one season or even one
year. In this environment, prices in the $4.00 to $5.00 per MMBtu
range have become the norm and will be sustained into the winter.
Equally important, further spikes to the $6.00 to $7.00 range cannot be
ruled out.
