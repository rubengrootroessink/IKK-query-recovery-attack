To get our message out we need to go electronic.

Please click on this link:   http://www.pecc.org/energy/esc.html

This was done in only a few hours.  A job done by professionals would look
much better.

But as our friend from the French embassy mentioned, we really should have
a web page to disseminate our information to a broader audience.  We can
put a great deal of our information up for public information.  We can even
create a "members section" where the coalition members use a password to go
for latest developments, information on progress on the working groups etc.
 We can have a "chat" section where we talk to each other, and again, where
working group members exchange information with each other and with Hills &
Co.

The possibilities really are endless.  But efficient!

Steve
