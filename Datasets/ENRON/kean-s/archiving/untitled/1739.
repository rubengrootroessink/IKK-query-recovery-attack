Attached are cryptic summaries of the current positions.  WPTF, APX, ISO and 
IEP are all fairly similar.  Enron is working with those parties to develop a 
common proposal.  The "Reform Coalition" (RC) is Hogan, sponsored by Sempra, 
with ORA/TURN/UCAN (they are all nuts), Reliant, Southern and WIlliams.  
Without the gens, they were going nowhere.  Southern has already left the 
coalition.  We and others have put a full court press on to Reliant (the 
source of the problem is John Stout in Houston).  The word is that Reliant 
will also leave -- we're hoping for a big splash saying both Southern and 
Reliant have left.

The other confusing issue is --why Sempra/San Diego G&E?  Terry Winter, ISO 
CEO and former officer at SDG&E, says that Sempra thinks nodalism is the only 
way to get prices high enough in San Diego to encourage construction of more 
power plants.  More power plants, more gas sales.  

The first item is a matrix from mid-April laying out all the positions at the 
time.  The RC has now introduced a slightly new proposal called "voluntary" 
-- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month-by-month 
basis.  This had not much support at the meeting at the ISO on May 10 and 11 
-- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway.

The next item is a VERY LONG (45 pps) ISO doc -- the ISO proposal is called 
zonal forward -- from late April.

I also included APX's "flowgate" model, which has some intriquing 
characteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications (it's 
very close to what we have proposed, and may be easier to use in a world with 
more parallel flows than we have today)

If you want more, more, MORE -- go to the ISO web site (caiso.com) then to 
Client Services, then to congestion reform, to see all the gory detail.
