Steve,
Attached is a copy of your group's latest AAP Utilization Analysis as of 
11/7/00.  Also attached is an explanatory memo of the report which can be 
used in the distribution of the report to your management team.  For 
comparison purposes, I have included the Utilization Analysis for 01/15/2000 
as well as the most recent Utilization Analysis.   

If you have any questions, you can call me at x37921 or Felecia Acevedo at

Sandra
