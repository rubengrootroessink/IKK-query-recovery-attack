> National Association of Manufacturers Chairman Tim Timken addressed the
> prestigious Economic Club of Detroit earlier this week.  His April 9
> speech, entitled "Amidst Economic and Market Jitters ... Manufacturing Is
> Still America's Best Bet for Growth," (attached) makes the case that the
> manufacturing sector has been the driving force behind the new economy and
> that manufacturing - aided by pro-growth policies - will be the sector to
> drive the economic recovery.
>
> I think you will find his speech of interest, and encourage you to draw
> from it in your own communications to your employees, your stockholders,
> your Congressional delegation, the media and other key audiences who need
> to be reminded or learn about how "manufacturing is still America's best
> bet for growth."
>
> I'm interested in your comments about the speech, so please feel free to
> respond to me by e-mail at jjasinowski@nam.org or by phone at (202)
> 637-3106.  I look forward to hearing from you.
