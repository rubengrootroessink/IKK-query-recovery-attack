Hey Steve; S
Sorry to bug you, but I'd like to ask howyou want us to include/review the 
MD's on 9 Jan, and whom among that group we should anticipate being reviewed, 
having profiles and data on etc?  We have the normal straight (for lack of a 
better description) MD's; we have the COO's who are also MD's (Lavorato, 
Sunde, Bowen, Mccarty, et. al); and finally we have the former EC members who 
are not Policy Committee (but were, and perhaps still are EC ( i.e. Haug, 
Bannentine, Sanjay, Tom White). 

Should they be :
reviewed all one group, 
divided so that COO's who are also policy committee and will be present on 9 
Jan remain in NR during the main review period, then excused for their reviews
How to handle the former EC members? Are they still EC or effectively MD's of 
another level to be reviewed separately?

Welcome your thoughts and advice on this,

Regards, Gina
