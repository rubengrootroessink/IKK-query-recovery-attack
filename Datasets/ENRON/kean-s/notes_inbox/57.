MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a=
=20
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of=20
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss=
ed=20
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller=
=20
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under =
no=20
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically=
=20
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly=
,=20
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the=
=20
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme=
nt=20
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to=
=20
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta=
ff=20
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p=
ro=20
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp=
ly=20
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and=
=20
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import=
s=20
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we=
ll=20
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that=20
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that=
=20
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could=
=20
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi=
cs=20
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with =
a=20
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the=
=20
commodity and services. =20

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such=
,=20
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic=
e=20
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff=
=20
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac=
k=20
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan=
ts=20
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. =
=20

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from=
=20
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. =
=20
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were=
=20
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even=
=20
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment=
,=20
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The=
=20
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are=
=20
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi=
on=20
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to=
=20
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission=
=20
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an=
=20
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I=
n=20
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase=
d=20
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie=
ve=20
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction=
=20
increased in the Midwest. =20

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati=
on=20
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo=
r=20
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a=
nd=20
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,=
=20
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs=
=20
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully=
=20
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers=
e,=20
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th=
at=20
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed=
=20
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching=
=20
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided=
=20
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp=
er=20
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al=
l=20
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and=
=20
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region=
=20
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th=
e=20
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. =
=20
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud=
it=20
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially=
=20
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are=
as=20
of non-compliance. =20

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,=
=20
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo=
w=20
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information=
=20
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under=
=20
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a=20
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption=
=20
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission coul=
d=20
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t=
he=20
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also=
,=20
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits=
=20
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha=
ve=20
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha=
ve=20
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide=
=20
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively"=20
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. =
=20
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,=
=20
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has=
=20
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the=
=20
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs=
=20
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d=
ue=20
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development=
=20
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and=
=20
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act=
ed=20
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the=
=20
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th=
is=20
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than=
=20
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to=
=20
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S=
E=20
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence=
=20
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes=
=20
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns=
=20
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio=
n=20
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In=
=20
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff=
=20
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. =
=20
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac=
k=20
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied=
=20
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.=
 =20
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati=
on=20
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais=
es=20
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv=
e=20
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d=
o=20
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs=
=20
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  =
In=20
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.=
 =20
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated=
=20
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the=
=20
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i=
e,=20
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio=
n=20
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la=
w=20
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of=
=20
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list=
s=20
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the=
=20
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park=
=20
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential=
.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin=
g=20
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan=
ge=20
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t=
o=20
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an=
=20
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not=
=20
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC=
=20
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine=20
competition.

NORTHEAST SUMMARY

Attached is a summary of FERC Staff=01,s November 1, 2000 report on its=20
investigation of the Northeast region.  The report is very encouraging=20
because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution=
s=20
that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging=
=20
because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast=
=20
markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked o=
n=20
this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report=20
(particularly sections 4 and 5) should be read in detail.  A copy of the=20
report is attached.
