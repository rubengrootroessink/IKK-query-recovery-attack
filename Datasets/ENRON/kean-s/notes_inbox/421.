Subject: Call memos regarding Sec. 201

The attached memo has been approved by Linda Robertson, Lisa Yoho, and Chris 
Long.  Additionally, we have a call memo for Ken Lay, that we will forward on 
early next week.

Chris Long will be in touch on Tuesday to help coordinate the recommended 
calls.  

Thanks,
