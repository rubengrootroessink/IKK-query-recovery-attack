Here is a working draft of the gas issues/diversion/penalties, etc. paper.  
Becky is working on the interstate pipeline tariffs and we will insert them, 
and Jeff Hidge will be sending something out about ENA legal issues, which I 
will add in.  I am also going to work on this tonite, to make the individual 
LDC diucssions follow a common template.  However, I wanted you to have 
something to look at before the meeting tomorrow morning.  I still have a 
couple of LDCs to add.  Thanks.
