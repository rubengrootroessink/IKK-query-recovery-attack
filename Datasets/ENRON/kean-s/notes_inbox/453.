Attached is the draft for the December agenda. The scenarios and attendees 
are a strong move in the direction of commodities, with less energy focus. I 
think this might be the right direction to go in though. Let me know your 
thoughts ASAP because we need to get moving on speakers. 

Thanks, MSA
