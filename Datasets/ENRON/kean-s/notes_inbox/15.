Mary --

Are you drafting responses to this?  I don't see the major issue.  I think we 
need to keep these in line with our larger response.  

Jim

This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!"  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

Attached is a list of questions Chairman Hoecker has proposed to parties that 
spoke at the Nov. 1 (I believe FERC means the 9th) meeting.  All but No. 3 
are  directed to Enron and the responses are due on Wednesday the 22nd.
