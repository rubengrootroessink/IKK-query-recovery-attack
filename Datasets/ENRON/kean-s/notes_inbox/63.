Hola!  Will you please take a look at this and let me know if you have 
suggestions?

We just got a new batch of shareholder resolutions (initiated by Friends of 
the Earth) because of Cuiaba.  As WWF told me, I guess it is "our Vietnam", 
even though they're pleased with the other actions we are taking...

FYI, I am also attaching the org chart we provided, which I think they have 
given the board.

Kelly,
Attached is the final version of the Board presentation that we need to send 
to Rebecca Carter and Terry West.  The only thing that has changes from the 
version we sent on Friday is I took out the parenthetical about 
industrialized countries in the upper left hand corner of the graphic as I 
thought it made it a little too busy and was extraneous information.
The last slide still has "placeholder" bullets under the "Expand Board 
Committee" - but you or Ken Lay can always explain the structure and scope in 
words.  

Rebecca asked me if "everyone had signed off on it - Steve Kean and all" and 
I said I would double-check before sending it.  Will you call me when you've 
reviewed this and then I'll be happy to send on the final version?
Thanks,
Catherine
