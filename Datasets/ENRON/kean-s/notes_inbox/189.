Jeannie drafted this op-ed in response to the situation in the California 
market.  Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with placement in a CA 
newspaper.  If so, we need to decide who should author and what is the ideal 
placement.  thx. kd

Karen, I've incorporated your suggestions. Still need to know current state
mw capacity and no. of peaking mw approved for next summer. Hope Jeff can
help or direct me to someone who can.

Sorry for this AOL transmission -- the system is running really slow.

Take care,
Jeannie
