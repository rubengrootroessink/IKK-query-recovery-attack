Subject: Gas Issues paper

For discussion during the conference call tomorrow, attached is a revision of 
Leslie's paper with an attachment illustrating the type of tariff information 
we are capturing for the interstates.  If you think we need to capture any 
additional information, please advise.

Here is a working draft of the gas issues/diversion/penalties, etc. paper.  
Becky is working on the interstate pipeline tariffs and we will insert them, 
and Jeff Hidge will be sending something out about ENA legal issues, which I 
will add in.  I am also going to work on this tonite, to make the individual 
LDC diucssions follow a common template.  However, I wanted you to have 
something to look at before the meeting tomorrow morning.  I still have a 
couple of LDCs to add.  Thanks.
