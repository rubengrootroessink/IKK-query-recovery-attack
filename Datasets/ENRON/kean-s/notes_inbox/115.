USA: Cinergy to buy two power plants from Enron.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Cinergy Corp. said Tuesday its non-regulated 
unit, Cinergy Capital & Trading Inc., would purchase two natural gas-fired 
power plants from Enron Corp. . 
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The two Enron units, the 494-megawatt (MW) Brownsville generating facility in 
Tennessee and the 504-MW Caledonia plant in Mississippi, would increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio owned, operated, or under construction, to 
about 21,000 MW, Cinergy said in a statement Tuesday. 
The Brownsville facility has four natural gas-fired combustion turbines, 
while the Caledonia facility has six. 
Both stations began operation in June 1999. They are located in the 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) and are interconnected to 
the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system, the statement said. 
The acquisition is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC), as well as other regulators, and is expected to be 
completed by the spring of 2001, Cinergy said. 
Cinergy Capital & Trading is an energy marketing and project development 
affiliate of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cinergy Corp. Cinergy's largest operating 
companies, Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co. and PSI Energy Inc. provide 
electricity to more than 1.4 million customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Cinergy Corp. (NYSE:CIN) today 
announced that Cinergy Capital & Trading, Inc. (CCT), a non-regulated 
affiliate of Cinergy Corp, and Enron North America have signed a definitive 
agreement under which CCT will purchase two natural gas-fired merchant 
electric generating facilities located in the southeastern United States. 
The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cinergy's earnings in 2001. 
Financial terms were not disclosed. Also, the transaction will increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio to about 21,000 megawatts (net owned, operated 
or under development) with the non-regulated portion being approximately 
15,000 megawatts.
"This acquisition in combination with our recently deregulated Ohio 
generation and the peaking capacity added early this year creates for Cinergy 
a significant and balanced generation portfolio of baseload and peaking 
capacity," said James E. Rogers, president and CEO of Cinergy Corp. 
"Importantly, these facilities can serve our large long-term customers in the 
Southeast, which is among the fastest growing areas in the country, as well 
as our Midwest customers." 
The acquisition consists of Enron's 494-megawatt Brownsville generation 
facility located in Haywood County, Tennessee and the 504-megawatt Caledonia 
generation facility located in Lowndes County, Mississippi. Brownsville has 
four natural gas-fired combustion turbines and Caledonia has six. Both 
stations entered into service in June 1999. Both facilities are located in 
the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) region and are 
interconnected to the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system. 
"Cinergy has created a regional leadership position in the Midwest power 
market and is focused on strategic opportunities to expand our footprint," 
said Michael J. Cyrus, president of Cinergy Capital & Trading. "With this 
transaction we will have added approximately 1,700 megawatts in the eastern 
interconnect and increased our non-regulated generating capacity in excess of 
30 percent in just over a year. It is indicative of our continued commitment 
to the growth and value of a balanced energy merchant business." 
The completion of the acquisition is subject to, among other things, receipt 
of approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and expiration of the 
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 
1976. Cinergy currently expects that regulatory approvals would be obtained 
and the transaction will close in Spring 2001.

project development affiliate of Cinergy Corp., one of the nation's leading 
diversified energy companies, with a total enterprise value of $8.5 billion

operating companies, The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and PSI Energy, 
Inc., serve more than 1.4 million electric customers and 478,000 gas 
customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 
Cinergy is active in U.S. power and natural gas markets and maintains a 
24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week trading operation. The interconnections of 
Cinergy's Midwestern transmission assets give it access to 37 percent of the 
total U.S. energy consumption. In 1998 the New York Mercantile Exchange 
selected Cinergy to be its transmission hub for Midwest electricity futures 
trading, which has become the most active hub in the United States. 
In addition to its U.S. operations, Cinergy owns and operates power 
generation, transmission and distribution assets in the Czech Republic,
