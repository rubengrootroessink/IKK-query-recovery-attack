PG&E, ISO agree to court order on power bills

specify that the Independent System Operator will not procure power except=

Peter Schrag: Turning up the heat in Houston and Washington


(Published June 6, 2001)=20

Behind all the palaver about the predictable standoff at last week's energy=

"summit" between President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, one major political=20
development was missed.=20
Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an=
d=20
maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20
handling of the mess to the generating companies, energy marketers and gas=
=20
pipeline companies that have richly profited from it, and thus to FERC, the=
=20
do-next-to-nothing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush=20
administration.=20
That wasn't all Davis' doing -- far from it -- though it's been at the hear=
t=20
of his message about energy industry "pirates" and "profiteers." Bush's=20
misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also=
=20
contributed mightily, not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to=
=20
get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20
More important, there's the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the=20
Republican Party and the resulting shift of control in the U.S. Senate, whe=
re=20
the next chair of the Energy Committee will be Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New=20
Mexico, a co-sponsor of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill capping wholesale=20
electric rates for the next two years. And chairing the Committee on=20
Governmental Affairs will be Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who's=20
already asked for an audit of energy prices.=20
Those changes will draw a lot more attention to recent studies showing that=
 a=20
handful of big generators -- Duke Power, Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy and the hu=
ge=20
energy-marketing firm Enron -- have gamed the market to drive wholesale=20
prices to levels that, in the year 2000, sometimes reached 40 times the=20
prices of the year before.=20
The findings come not merely from economists at the California Independent=
=20
System Operator, the agency that manages the state's grid, who estimate=20
overcharges resulting from market power at $6.2 billion for last year alone=
.=20
They come also from Severin Borenstein and his colleagues at the University=

of California Energy Institute, who "conservatively" calculate the=20
overcharges at $4.5 billion; from Paul Joskow, a widely respected energy=20
economist at MIT; and from Edward Kahn, an economic analyst in San Francisc=
o.=20
In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20
Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's "considerable evidence that the high=
=20
prices experienced in the summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplie=
s=20
from the market by suppliers [generators or marketers] exercising market=20
power." That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al=
so=20
at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those=
=20
spikes even more curious.=20
There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20
natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest=
=20
gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20
California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance=
=20
between supply and demand.=20
None of that may be illegal. If there's no collusion, there are no violatio=
ns=20
of antitrust laws. But it adds plenty of steam to the political argument. I=

a vigorous Senate investigation ought to be obvious.=20
The clincher is "Blackout," a "Frontline" program that both symbolizes the=

shifting emphasis and reinforces it. (The program is scheduled to be aired =
at=20
8 p.m. Friday on Sacramento cable Channel 7.) It isn't another recital of=

Californians worrying about their electric bills, or about the stupidity of=

the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20
crisis. It is about those generators and marketers in Houston and North=20

Is trading an insider's game?=20



Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is=
=20
stacked against consumers
By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 6, 2001=20
While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20
market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly=
=20
growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20
The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere=
=20
around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20
Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20
consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20

"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang=
e=20
the stock price," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess=
or=20
and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20
Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power=
=20
provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit=
y,=20
lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20
market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like=
=20
electricity.=20
But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.=
=20
In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t=
o=20
collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20
To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star=
s=20
in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20
uncommon.=20
The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20
commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20
Corp.'s California plants.=20
In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th=
at=20
gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,=
=20
the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia=
ms=20
Cos.=20
Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,=
=20
company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20
It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp=
ra=20
Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,=
=20
the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20
A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas=
ed=20
some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar=
d=20
their positions.=20
This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th=
an=20
5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the=
=20
wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for=
=20
consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20
Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi=
s=20
year.
Advance sales
All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20
In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie=
s=20
such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and=
=20
others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20
electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20
trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20
electricity inventory.=20
Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20
trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,=
=20
which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20
It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20
increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20
conditions.=20
Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One=
=20
of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20
competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio=
n=20
side of the business.=20
For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20
indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20
More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built=
=20
by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different=
=20
companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20
"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20
(one-thousandth of a dollar)," said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray=
=20
Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20
So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on=
=20
trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve=
n=20
better, rising sharply.
Little regulation
But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning=
=20
electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro=
m=20
energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least=
=20
little that has been of concern to FERC.=20
In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold=
=20
from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20
trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted=
=20
once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20
admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up=
=20
prices.=20
FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras=
t=20
to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20
Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission=
.=20
FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi=
am=20
Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.=
=20
"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up," Massey said. "It's a=
n=20
extraordinarily complicated market.=20
"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're=
=20
kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi=
ps=20
flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari=
ly=20
produce reasonable prices. They produce profits."=20
Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20
utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20
electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for=
=20
profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open=
ed=20
the market.=20
Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20
California's major utilities and Wall Street firms.
Market volatility
In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.=
=20
But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us=
e=20
is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20
When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20
budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that =
it=20
charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity=
=20
that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20
Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,=
=20
who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t=
o=20
collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost=

The governor's press secretary, Steve Maviglio, told reporters yesterday th=

the daily amount spent on power is now "well below" $50 million, which was=

A 12-day gap in the most recent notice to the Legislature that another $500=

Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state power purchasing agency, said that=

the average cost of power was under $40 million during the first four days =

Maviglio attributed the lower cost to conservation, the phasing in of cheap=

However, he said, "The average cost is still way over what we paid last=20

During a briefing on May 21, Fichera told reporters that the amount of powe=

contracts that had been agreed on in principle could increase those amounts=

to 73 percent in June, 67 percent in July, and 60 percent in August.=20
"We are still on target. There are risks," Fichera said yesterday, among th=

But under the terms of approval recommended by Energy Commission Chairman=
=20
William Keese, CalPeak's plant would be able to operate "up to 8,760 hours=

'Hi, My Name Isn't Justice, Honey,' and Shame on Lockyer=20
By TOM G. PALMER


?????Here's what California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said at a press=20
conference about Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay: "I would love to=20
personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooe=
d=20
dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey."'=20
?????Here's why Lockyer should be removed from his office of public trust:=
=20
First, because as the chief law enforcement officer of the largest state in=
=20
the nation, he not only has admitted that rape is a regular feature of the=
=20
state's prison system, but also that he considers rape a part of the=20
punishment he can inflict on others.=20
?????Second, because he has publicly stated that he would like to personall=
y=20
arrange the rape of a Texas businessman who has not even been charged with=
=20
any illegal behavior.=20
?????Lockyer's remarks reveal him to be an authoritarian thug, someone whol=
ly=20
unsuited to holding an office of public trust.=20
?????But his remarks do have one positive merit: They tell us what criminal=
=20
penalties really entail.=20
?????Contrary to some depictions of prisons as country clubs, they are=20
violent and terrible places. More and more politicians propose criminal=20
sanctions for more and more alleged misdeeds, and as a result ever more kin=
ds=20
of behavior are sanctioned by criminal penalties, perhaps now even selling=
=20
electricity. Those found guilty of such crimes are put into cages, where th=
ey=20
are deprived of their liberty and dignity and, as Lockyer so clearly=20
acknowledged, raped and brutalized. What's worse, Lockyer has indicated tha=
t=20
he believes that rape is an appropriate part of the system of punishments h=
e=20
administers.=20
?????Should it matter that Lay is a businessman? Imagine the outcry if the=
=20
head of Enron were female. What would Lockyer's fellow Democrats have said =
to=20
that?=20
?????Should it matter that Lay is chairman of an electricity generator? Doe=
s=20
the nature of his business justify threats to escort him to his own rape?=
=20
Lockyer told the Los Angeles Times that he had singled out Enron's chairman=
=20
because the Houston-based company is the world's largest energy trader.=20
?????So apparently singling out a man for a heinous threat is OK because he=
's=20
the chairman of the world's largest energy trading company. That's accordin=
g=20
to the man who, as a state senator, sponsored California's 1984 hate-crimes=

religion and sexual orientation feels no hesitation at all about intimidati=
ng=20
someone and threatening him with the brutal use of physical force simply=20
because he heads the world's largest energy trading company.=20
?????Lockyer and Gov. Gray Davis seem to think that the best way to keep th=

to offer to pay competitive rates in competitive markets. Are energy=20

WASHINGTON -- The wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas in=20
California have fallen sharply in recent weeks, and experts said Tuesday th=
at=20
the relief could be the harbinger of an energy turnaround.=20
Or it may be just a blip.=20
In the last couple of weeks, California power prices have plunged to the=20
lowest levels since April 2000, traders say, with electricity selling on so=
me=20
days for less than $100 per megawatt-hour.=20
At night, when demand slackens, power sometimes sells for less than $20 per=
=20
megawatt-hour. That is reminiscent of the days before prices went haywire=
=20
last summer.=20
It is a drastically different scenario than the $500 to $800 the state paid=
=20
during a spate of hot weather last month.=20
Meanwhile, wholesale natural gas prices at a bellwether pipeline junction o=
n=20
the Southern California -Arizona border dipped last week to their lowest=20
levels since November, according to a publication that tracks the industry.=
=20
Separately, Southern California Gas Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.=20
reported June rate cuts for their residential gas customers of 16% and 38%,=
=20
respectively.=20
Experts credited a combination of conservation, mild weather, a burst of=20
increased hydroelectric generation and lower natural gas prices for the dro=
p=20
in electricity costs.=20
"Conservation is starting to worry the generators, which is nice to see,"=
=20
said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20
Institute in Berkeley. Californians used 11% less energy last month than in=
=20
May 2000, according to the state Energy Commission.=20
"I'm worried that if we don't push harder on conservation, [prices] won't=
=20
stay down," Borenstein added.=20
On the natural gas side, experts said the price decline is due to replenish=
ed=20
storage within California , a nationwide drop in the cost of the fuel and=
=20
easing demand from power plants.=20
The number of shippers competing to get natural gas to the state has also=
=20
increased, with the expiration of a controversial contract on the El Paso=
=20
pipeline system last week.=20
But economists were reluctant to make sweeping predictions based on the=20
latest indicators.=20
"It's hard to draw specific conclusions," said Bruce Henning, who tracks th=
e=20
natural gas markets for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc., an Arlingto=
n,=20
Va., consulting firm.=20
How the summer turns out depends on the weather in the state, Henning said,=
=20
adding, "The weather represents the balance in the Southern California=20
market."=20
Natural gas fuels most California power plants. With wholesale prices=20
recently averaging three to four times the rates charged elsewhere in the=
=20
country, state and federal officials have despaired of chances for=20

Last Friday, however, the daily price for immediate delivery of natural gas=
=20
in Topock, Ariz., a pipeline junction near the California border, dipped to=
=20
$7.85 per million British thermal units.=20
According to Natural Gas Week, it was the first time since mid-November tha=
t=20
the price at that location had fallen below $8 per million BTUs. One millio=
n=20

t=20
$9.36 per million BTUs at the close of business Tuesday, still below recent=
=20
weekly averages.=20
Other industry publications have also picked up signals of price declines.=
=20
Platts, the energy information division of McGraw-Hill Cos., reported Tuesd=
ay=20
that the price for monthly gas delivery contracts to California fell 22% in=
=20
June, following a nationwide trend.=20
But Henning said the drop in California prices is attributable to both lowe=
r=20
prices around the country and a decline in the high markups for shipping ga=
s=20
to California . Those markups, which far exceed the cost of transporting ga=
s,=20
have drawn the attention of state and federal investigators.=20
Henning said the markups are declining as depleted storage levels in=20
California are replenished. "Storage levels have been filling very rapidly,=
=20
and that fact is reflected in prices coming down," he said.=20
The link between natural gas and electricity prices is a hotly debated=20
subject. Some experts say high-priced natural gas is driving up the cost of=

California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest lev=
el=20
in more than a year, partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices=
=20
for natural gas, which fuels most power plants.=20
Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in=20
months ahead.=20
But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last=
=20
summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may=
=20
have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs.=20
"California is not yet out of the woods," said Kelley Doolan, who tracks=20
natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. "But this is a very=
=20
significant decrease in costs."=20
Along with lower gas prices, the decline in electricity costs was attribute=
d=20
by state and industry officials to milder weather, which reduces demand for=
=20
power. They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and=20
better-than-expected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants.=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
energy-industry association, said these factors came together to produce th=
e=20
lowest wholesale electricity prices since April 2000.=20
Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as=
=20
little as $50 per megawatt hour, he noted, compared with more than $500=20
earlier this year.=20
"If the weather stays this way, we could have reasonable prices all summer,=
 "=20
Ackerman said. "We may also have fewer blackouts."=20
It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in=
=20
energy prices. If power companies manipulated prices on the way up, as=20
critics have alleged, might they not be up to some trick as prices head in=
=20
the opposite direction?=20
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San=20
Francisco, speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fa=
ll=20
so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in=
=20
the dysfunctional California market.=20
"They're trying to take the heat off," she said.=20
Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistic=
al=20
blip.=20
"This was just one month's decline," said Michael Shames, executive directo=
r=20
of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "We really have to s=
ee=20
how this plays out in the future."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor was very=
=20
encouraged by the lower energy prices. Davis announced Sunday that=20
California's power use was down 11 percent last month from a year before.=
=20
"We're not there yet," Maviglio said of whether an end to the state's power=
=20
woes is in sight. "But the trend is pointing in the right direction."=20
WHITE ELEPHANT
Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side: California cou=
ld=20
end up with a huge white elephant after spending about $40 billion in publi=
c=20
funds on long-term power contracts.=20
The logic behind the contracts, which are at an average price of $69 per=20
megawatt hour over 10 years, is that the state expected to pay below-market=
=20
rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and=20
California found itself paying above-market rates.=20
If current trends continue, though, California will find itself paying=20
consistently above-market rates much sooner than expected, making the long-=
=20
term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so=
=20
handsomely during the state's darkest hours.=20
"The contracts look really ugly right now," said Shames at the Utility=20
Consumers' Action Network. "They may be way overpriced."=20
Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said it is too early to conclude that t=
he=20
state did poorly negotiating dozens of long-term power contracts.=20
"No one has a crystal ball on this," he said.=20
CUSTOMERS' BILLS TO DROP
In any case, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that customers'=20
average gas bills will drop 26 percent this month to $26 and should stay ne=
ar=20
that level all summer.=20
Platts, which monitors average monthly spot prices, found that the wholesal=
e=20
price of gas at the California-Oregon border has tumbled nearly 42 percent=
=20
since the beginning of May -- from $9.98 per million British thermal units =
to=20
$5.81.=20
The wholesale gas price at the California-Arizona border fell 45 percent,=
=20
from $11.91 to $6.50. This compares with a 25 percent monthly decline in=20
average natural gas prices nationwide.=20
However, California gas prices are still about 50 percent higher than they=
=20
were a year ago, whereas national prices are now below year-ago levels for=
=20
the first time since last spring.=20
While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall, Doolan=
=20
attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge =
in=20
prices last month related to fears of a long, hot summer of rolling=20
blackouts.=20
"You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer," =
he=20
said. "That created enormous demand for electricity generation.=20
"What has changed is that we've had weeks of mild weather," Doolan observed=
.=20
"The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all=
=20
the gas."=20
This allowed utilities like PG&E to beef up gas inventories, which eased=20
demand and resulted in substantially lower prices, he said.=20
'BACK ON TRACK'=20
"We're back on track to be completely full for winter," said Staci Homrig, =

the winter. PG&E is forecasting that customers' average gas bills could ris=

to as high as $75 in December if current trends continue.=20
However, the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that=

In a clear sign that the political landscape has shifted because of the=20

for construction of a generating plant it had unanimously opposed in=20

at=20
Coyote Valley.=20
That pressure -- increased by the occasional rolling blackout -- has come=
=20
from nearly every corner of the state, from elected officials to high-tech=
=20
businesses and labor unions worried the power crisis will drain away jobs,=
=20
ruin the economy and lead to voter backlash over skyrocketing energy bills.=
=20
Even the local branch of the NAACP and environmentalists pushed the council=
=20
to approve the Calpine proposal -- despite overwhelming opposition from the=

plant's neighbors.=20
Council members did not hide their disdain yesterday for being forced to=20
reconsider their opposition to the so-called Metcalf Energy Center.=20
"I'm holding my nose to vote for this thing," said Councilwoman Linda=20
LeZotte.=20
"I'm just as unhappy as everybody else," Vice Mayor George Shirakawa said. =
"I=20
feel like no matter what happens, we can't win."=20
GOVERNOR OFFERED HIS SUPPORT
After the council's solid opposition in November, Calpine appealed to the=
=20
California Energy Commission, which has the final say. The controversial=20
plant then received a huge boost in April when Gov. Gray Davis threw his=20
support behind it.=20
San Jose officials conceded yesterday that the energy commission was likely=
=20
to override their opposition and grant approval within a few weeks. They sa=
id=20
the commission's likely approval was stripping them of their power to decid=
e=20
local land-use issues.=20
"What I think has happened . . . is the governor and the Legislature at the=

=20
"I don't think there's any chance at all the California Energy Commission i=
s=20
going to turn down the Metcalf Energy Center," Councilman Chuck Reed said.=
=20
CONSTRUCTION MAY BEGIN SOON
If given the go-ahead by the state, Calpine could begin construction as ear=
ly=20
as next month. The natural-gas fired plant would generate electricity by=20
mid-2003, company spokesman Kenneth Arbeu said.=20
At the urging of Mayor Ron Gonzales, the council yesterday approved a new=
=20
"cooperation agreement" with Calpine. The vote, with Councilman Forrest=20
Williams casting the lone nay, is preliminary while a final vote that is=20
scheduled for June 26.=20
Gonzales argued that the agreement did not amount to a flip-flop because it=
=20
differs from what Calpine proposed in November.=20
The agreement approved by the council calls for increased monitoring of air=
=20
pollution, the use of treated wastewater to cool the plant, which will redu=
ce=20
discharges into San Francisco Bay, and a $6.5 million "community benefits"=
=20
package, with the bulk going toward parkland acquisition, Gonzales said.=20
"This council has not changed its decision," he said. "What we've done is=
=20
change the facility."=20
Critics, incensed that the city was buckling to outside pressure, vowed to=
=20
change the council at the next election.=20
CONCERNS OVER HEALTH RISKS
They raised concerns that boiled wastewater steam wafting over their homes=
=20
from Calpine's plant could pose health risks. Jona Denz-Hamilton said more=
=20
controls are needed to ensure the safety of neighbors like herself and her=
=20
family and argued that new, cleaner-burning technologies should be installe=
d=20
at the plant.=20
"It's too great of a risk," she said.=20
Other critics said the state's energy woes will be solved and largely=20
forgotten by the time the plant opens in two years, while the Santa Teresa=
=20
neighborhood will be stuck with pollution for decades.=20
Approval seemed a given at the start of the more than three-hour hearing.=
=20
Much of the afternoon's debate focused around plans to extend a pipeline fo=

treated wastewater to the new plant.=20
Critics said Calpine was receiving a sweet deal by paying only $10 million =

Los Angeles -- These are flush times for the city's Department of Water and=
=20
Power and the energy executives are loving every minute of it.=20
As are their customers.=20
Private power companies throughout California have been raising rates and=
=20
warning customers about a long, hot summer filled with blackouts, but the=
=20
city- owned DWP has been keeping prices stable and the lights on for 1.2=20
million Los Angeles customers.=20
"Our customers are being really nice to us," said Angelina Galiteva, the=20
utility's strategic planning director. "They love the DWP."=20
Although Gov. Gray Davis' administration announced that the state had reduc=
ed=20
its energy consumption 11 percent from a year ago, those in Los Angeles had=
=20
cut back less than half that -- and polls show they view the energy situati=
on=20
less seriously than other Californians.=20
Public utilities such as Los Angeles water and power have seen their revenu=
es=20
increase during the energy crunch because they can sell their excess power =
at=20
higher prices than ever before in a market tilted toward sellers.=20
The rest of the state doesn't always feel that same warm glow. Davis has=20
accused the DWP and other California public utilities of putting exorbitant=
=20
price tags on the excess electricity they sell to the rest of the energy-=
=20
starved state.=20
It's a charge Los Angeles utility executives deny, arguing that their exces=
s=20
power is sold at cost plus 15 percent, which they say is a fair return for=
=20
their customers.=20
"Without our support, a million more homes (elsewhere in California) would=
=20
have suffered rolling blackouts, which is a powerful message," Galiteva sai=
d.=20
It wasn't supposed to be this way. When the power industry was deregulated =
in=20
the late '90s, energy giants like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern=
=20
California Edison were expected to be the big winners. Now, PG&E is in=20
bankruptcy and Edison is a short step away.=20
"When deregulation came, the experts said that the investor-owned utilities=
=20
would become lean, mean machines that would be better able to operate in th=
e=20
new environment," Galiteva said. "But now public power has shown it can ser=
ve=20
customers more efficiently at lower rates."=20
While much of the state worries about electrical supply, Los Angeles=20
residents have been saved many of those concerns.=20
In a survey done last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, 4=
8=20
percent of the people in the Bay Area thought that electricity cost and=20
availability were the most important issues facing the state. In Los Angele=
s,=20
however, only 33 percent put the energy crunch on top. When questioned abou=
t=20
the size of the power problem and the effect it would have on the state's=
=20
economy, Los Angeles residents were consistently less concerned than people=
=20
elsewhere in California.=20
People in Los Angeles have been "somewhat isolated" from the energy crisis,=
=20
concluded Mark Baldassare, who conducted the survey.=20
That doesn't mean the state's energy problems haven't had an effect. The DW=
P=20
has seen a 3 percent to 5 percent reduction in some uses, which officials=
=20
have dubbed "sympathy conservation." The utility also is offering its bigge=
st=20
customers financial incentives to cut back on their power use.=20
"Our average annual load growth is about 80 megawatts," Galiteva said. "By=
=20
this summer, we expect to have saved 40 megawatts through conservation. By=
=20
December, we expect 60 megawatts in savings."=20
The utility also is making a major attempt to create a conservation ethic=
=20
among its customers. DWP's comfortable situation has made it possible to=20
offer them the carrot without the need to show them the stick.=20
"Conservation no longer means doing without," Galiteva said. "Beer can be=
=20
just as cold with a superefficient refrigerator. Rooms can be just as brigh=
t=20
with superefficient light bulbs."=20
A "Green Power" program also is promoting the use of renewable energy=20
resources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. About 75,000 custome=

are paying an extra $3 per month to increase DWP's use of renewable power=

"We're trying to give our customers a choice and a voice in determining the=

now or see it being mandated later."=20
Los Angeles power officials -- and their customers -- know the DWP isn't=20

Councilman Forrest Williams, who represents the Santa Teresa neighborhood=

Still, Councilwoman Pat Dando and some of her colleagues raised questions=
=20
about the deal they said they want answered before the final vote. Their=20
issues could be incorporated into the final deal.=20

Gonzales agreed to have the city build to accommodate the project, $10=20
million of which would be reimbursed by Calpine over 30 years.=20
Pipeline possibility=20
Dando said that a private company, Great Oaks Water, may be willing to buil=
d=20
the pipeline extension itself, saving the city the $50 million expense.=20
Officials at Great Oaks were unavailable Tuesday.=20
Council members peppered staff with other questions. Many were alarmed by=
=20
claims of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, which said that using treate=
d=20
sewage water to cool the power plant could allow dangerous chemicals to see=
p=20
into drinking water aquifers. An environmental services director said the=
=20
recycled water meets federal specifications, but that there is no protocol=
=20
for testing other chemicals not included in those standards.=20
Councilman Ken Yeager asked why Calpine should be allowed to spread a $3.9=
=20
million water connection fee over 10 years -- an arrangement that would=20
mandate an amendment to city law.=20
LeZotte, meanwhile, said she wants to hold Calpine accountable to install=
=20
ammonia-free technology at the plant. Ammonia is highly hazardous, and=20
residents say the use of the chemical to clean the plant is among their chi=
ef=20
concerns.=20
The agreement requires the company to install technology to reduce or=20
eliminate the use ammonia when it becomes ``technologically and economicall=
y=20

included in the deal.=20
Tuesday's vote marked a stark departure from the council's November vote to=

President George W. Bush's energy package encourages the use of biomass fue=
ls=20
for both transportation purposes and electricity generation. "They can=20
provide a reliable source of energy at a stable price, and they can also=20
generate income for farmers, landowners and others who harness them," his=
=20
administration's report said.=20

Despite this warm and fuzzy language, however, the administration offered n=
o=20
tangible funding for the fledgling biofuels industry=01*other than an exten=
sion=20
of an existing ethanol tax credit that was not due to expire until 2007=01*=
a=20
significant disappointment, and surprise, to advocates of renewable=20
transportation fuels.

The report did recommend expanding tax credits for biomass energy projects =
to=20
include forest-related and agriculture fuel sources and threw its weighty=
=20
support at a new credit for electricity produced from biomass co-fired with=
=20
coal. These recommendations are already included in the president's 2002=20
budget.=20

"We are pleased that the administration included expansion of the biomass t=
ax=20
credit and hope that, with congressional leadership, we will see this=20
expanded provision signed into law this year," said Katherine Hamilton,=20
co-director of the American Bioenergy Association (ABA).=20

Unlike other portions of the recommended energy policy, biomass energy=20
probably will not suffer under the recent change in Senate composition, giv=
en=20
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's (D-S.D.) agricultural constituency and=
=20
his previous support of the biofuels industry.=20

According to the National Energy Policy Development report, biomass account=
s=20
for about 76% of non-hydropower renewable electricity generation,=20
representing a total of about 1.6% of total U.S. electricity supply.=20

Biopower advocates, however, envision an even greater market penetration in=
=20
the coming decades and point to its environmental and ancillary advantages.=
=20
For example, given that biomass combustion can be carbon dioxide-neutral (i=
f=20
the growth and use cycle is managed sustainably), environmental groups=20
support an expanded role. Farmers with marginal lands that could grow bioma=
ss=20
fuel could enjoy economic benefits. With large amounts of wood residue, the=
=20
forest industry also stands to benefit from wider use of wood as a power=20
source.=20


Renewable energy offers a particular advantage to the lumber and paper=20
industry, and many analysts project that the industry may soon become a net=
=20
seller of electricity.=20

"In the lumber and paper industries, wood scraps are sometimes directly fed=
=20
into boilers to produce steam for their manufacturing processes or to heat=
=20
their buildings. For that reason, renewable energy offers a particular=20

policy report.=20

Co-firing with coal
Biomass=01*usually wood or wood residue=01*has traditionally been burned di=
rectly=20
in the industrial sector for heat or on-site electricity generation.=20
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the existing 10 GW of=20
installed capacity are based on this direct-combustion technology.=20

For utilities and power-generating companies with coal-fired capacity,=20
however, biomass co-firing may represent one of the least-cost renewable=20
energy options, said the DOE. The process involves blending different=20
materials in varying amounts with coal.=20

Not only does mixing biomass with coal reduce emissions, it is likely to be=
=20
cost-effective. Southern Co. estimates that a biomass plant alone could=20
generate power, depending on its location, at 4 to 11 cents/kWh. Given that=
=20
the lower range of this corresponds to coal generation costs, there are=20
clearly circumstances where biomass-coal co-firing would be economically=20
attractive today. Plus, the environmental public relations benefit for=20
utilities with coal-fired capacity would be valuable.=20


Domestic biomass generation capacity could reach 20-30 GW by the year 2020 =
by=20
co-firing at existing U.S. coal-fired power plants.=20

According to a recent report prepared by five National Laboratories, domest=
ic=20
biomass generation capacity could reach 20-30 GW by the year 2020 by=20
co-firing at existing U.S. coal-fired power plants.=20

A recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel for Climate=
=20
Change (IPCC) also cites the potential of coal co-firing with biomass. The=
=20
IPCC report concludes that co-firing in coal boilers results in the lowest=
=20
cost and least technical risk of the examined approaches for biomass=20
conversion to electricity.=20

Working out the technical kinks
Already, said the DOE, six power plants in the U.S. are currently co-firing=
=20
coal and wood residue products on a regular basis. Another 10 plants have=
=20
successfully tested co-firing over the last decade, and at least six more=
=20
plants are now conducting or planning tests.=20

For example, Southern Co. is working with DOE, the Southern Research=20
Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute to study ways to grow a=
nd=20
harvest switchgrass to blend with coal as a fuel for power generation.=20
Ideally suited for the southeastern U.S., switchgrass is a rugged grass tha=
t=20
can be grown on marginal agricultural land. Reaching heights of up to 12=20
feet, it requires little fertilization and herbicide and can be harvested=
=20
twice a year.=20

Harvesting methods, co-milling of switchgrass and pulverized coal,=20
pilot-scale co-firing tests, and a full-scale demonstration of co-firing at=
=20
Alabama Power Co.'s Plant Gadsden are part of Southern Co.'s collaborative=
=20
project.=20

The U.S. Agriculture Department is also taking a role in exploring the=20
potential of biomass and coal co-firing as a means to give farmers new=20
markets, especially for currently idle land. The agency recently authorized=
=20
funding for three co-firing demonstration projects.=20

In Iowa, the Chariton Valley Biomass Project is a cooperative effort to=20
develop warm and cool season grasses (such as switchgrass) to co-fire with=
=20
coal at Alliant Energy's Ottumwa Generating Station. The project is designe=
d=20
to generate a sustained supply of 35 MW of biomass energy. Eventually, the=
=20
grass could substitute for as much as 5% of the coal currently burned at th=
e=20
plant.=20


In addition to reducing coal emissions, the Chariton Valley Biomass Project=
=20
will support the local farm economy.=20

In addition to reducing coal emissions, the project will support the local=
=20
farm economy because the grass and trees will come from acreage taken out o=
f=20
production under the Agriculture Department's Conservation Reserve Program=
=20
(CRP). CRP land is generally marginal land that the government subsidizes=
=20
farmers to leave idle to both prevent erosion and protect commodity prices=
=20
from product surpluses.=20

The Pennsylvania Switchgrass Energy and Conservation Project will produce=
=20
switchgrass on CRP land for sale to a local cooperative's coal-fired=20
fluid-bed combustors.=20

In New York, the Agriculture Department project will fund willow biomass=20
crops and switchgrass on CRP acreage in the central and western part of the=
=20
state. The primary markets for the willow biomass are two coal-burning powe=
r=20
plants and a small university central heating facility.=20

Land conflicts, transportation may be obstacles
As these pilot projects illustrate, biomass conversion efforts may have the=
=20
most significant potential in rural areas. "Since biomass is widely=20
distributed it has good potential to provide rural areas with a renewable=
=20
source of energy. The challenge is to provide =01( conversion and delivery =
of=20
bioenergy to the marketplace in the form of modern and competitive energy=
=20
sources," said the IPCC report.=20

A potential drawback to co-firing is transportation. Transportation of=20
wood-based energy products is more costly, per unit of energy, than coal, f=
or=20
example, and most analysts believe it will prove most economical to site=20
generation plants near biomass sources.=20

"The generating plant or biorefinery must be located near to the resource t=
o=20
minimize transport costs of the low-energy-density biomass as well as to=20
minimize impacts on air and water use," the IPCC report said. However, note=
s=20
the report's authors, economies of scale may be significant enough to offse=
t=20
the transport costs involved.=20

A potential drawback over the long term, however, for biomass conversion is=
=20
land use conflicts. The IPCC report notes that by 2100, the global land=20
requirement to feed the growing world population will increase substantiall=
y.=20
"Up until this time there may well be sufficient land to supply all demands=
=20
for food, fibre and energy, but at some stage after that, land-use conflict=
s=20
could arise and before that, competition for water and irrigation may be a=
=20
constraint."=20
