Subject: Ask Why? Campaign

 I have worked for Enron for 8 1/2 years.  For what it is worth, I really 
enjoyed the recent "Ode to Why" commercial.  The imagery of past struggles 
shown with short video-clips was first class.  When I saw the ad on TV, it 
caught my attention and I knew I liked it even before I realized it was an 
Enron commercial.  Congratulations on what I believe is the best 
advertisement I have seen yet for Enron.  

  I read a brief article this morning that you may find of interest.  The 
name "Enron" will appear in Microsoft's spell-check dictionary in its Word 
2000 release.  Enron is certainly becoming a household name!
