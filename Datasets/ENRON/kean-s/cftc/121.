As I mentioned earlier to Mark, Jeff Girth of the NYT again today contacted=
 Lee Sachs about Enron.  You recall Lee was Asst Secretary of Treasury for =
Financial Markets during the Clinton Administration.  From his conversation=
, Lee reports the following items were raised by Girth:  a) the state of en=
ergy trading products and investment climate; b)  Enron's role in this mark=
et; c) whether and how financial energy products drive pricing and supply o=
f physical energy products (Lee told him emphatically no); and, c) whether =
government regulators understand these issues.  Lee said this is clearly an=
 Enron specific story.  Lee thinks Girth came away from the conversation wi=
th more of a right perspective (namely that these are important markets and=
 that we play a vital role).  Lee said that Girth was less focussed on pass=
age of the CEA and the politics than Girth had been in an earlier conversat=
ion; almost all  of today's conversation was forward looking.  Girth told L=
ee that he had not told Lee "all" that is behind this story, but did say th=
at there is an interesting twist (Lee thinks Girth perhaps something specif=
ic either on a document front or source).   Lee gave Girth a list of expert=
s to talk to who are unbiased but clearly right thinking on the subject.  L=
ee suggested that Girth to:  Pat Parkinson at the Fed (the godfather of the=
 "hands off" regulatory perspective for the OTC market), Bill Rainer, and E=
d Rosen (a prominent attorney in NY).  Lee expects Girth to keep calling hi=
m.
