Rebecca and Kelly:  I've attached the letter from Ken to the Board notifying 
them that we were named "Most Innovative Company in America" for the sixth 
consecutive year.  Ken has approved the letter and it contains his electronic 
signature.  I've formated the letter and left room for names and addresses.  
You can adjust as needed.

Please mail it at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.

Mary
