Elizabeth --

Thanks for continuing to keep us informed.  While I can appreciate this is
out of your control, you are one of our voices left there in Houston.  It
seems to me that there is, frankly, no excuse for the continuing delay on
expenses.  It is baffling that the company has not even asked the court for
permission to pay them.  We read of people getting millions to work 90 days=
,
yet the rest of us with much smaller bank accounts can't repaid for expense=
s
we incurred and had approved while employees.  American Express just
announced their own layoffs of thousands so I doubt they will be very
forgiving.

Anything you or others can do in Houston, particularly at this time of year=
,
would be appreciated.

Finally, who on the official creditors committee is there to represent
employees and ex-employees -- anybody?
