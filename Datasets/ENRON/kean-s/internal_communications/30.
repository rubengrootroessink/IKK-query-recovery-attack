If the expenses are not attributable to BUs then they're attributable to our Corp. cost centers.

I just learned of another one this morning - Luiz Maurer has over $8,000.  I'm trying to get a  list from the expense system so that I can give you exact numbers and a complete list.

Thanks!

Elizabeth,

Are you saying that for those with expenses not attributable to BUs they are personal?  If so, we are not focusing on that, only business expenses.

Kalen - Per your conversation with Steve Kean, I'm aware of the following employees have expenses in excess of $5,000.

Henry Van - Total of $11,926.99 (individual reports of $10,504.19 and $1,422.80)  None is attributable to business units.

James Rountree - Total of $6,275.27 (individual reports of $6,208.18 and $67.09)  Approx. $2,000 attributable to Japan.

Chuck Goode - Total of $74,781.36 (individual reports of $10,688.50, $46,361.32 and $17,728.54)  At least part of this is attributable to business units, I'm working on getting that breakdown.
