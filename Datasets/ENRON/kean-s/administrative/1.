Jeff, Gerry - 

Below is data on Houston's office lease market which you may find of 
interest.  The alternate to a "new" suburban lease is space Enron controls in 
Three Allen Center, levels 38 and 39.  Our term runs through Dec. of '05, 
with options to extend.

I will call to set a meeting and we can explore all options.  Thanks - Bill
