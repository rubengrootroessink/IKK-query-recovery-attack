Here you go.  It's rough, but hopefully starts to scope out what we would
put into a presentation.  The two real missing pieces are the script -- we
are not proposing to do chapter & verse on each of these transactions but
rather to highlight the key points -- and Ken's introduction to the call.

Look forward to your comments (and appreciate your discretion!)
