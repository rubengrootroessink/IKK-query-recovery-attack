I talked with Chairman Schriber this morn to give him a heads-up on the 
meeting Barbara and I are having with the Governor's Chief of Staff in 
follow-up to Ken Lay and Governor Taft's conversation on transmission 
access.  (We are going to try and get Taft to push for Ken Lay to be the 
keynote speaker at the NGA in February).

Schriber indicated that beginning next month, he plans to make transmission 
issues a top priority since he believes that to be the largest impediment to 
competition.  He thinks we need to create a secondary market and that all the 
acamedicians are making this more complex than it needs to be.  We also 
talked about about the native load language in the settlements.  I  offered 
to have Enron come in and talk to him about our vision on how the 
transmission system should work and he was very enthusiastic and said he 
would give us a full day if we needed it.  

My assessment is that Schriber is a little naive about the ease with which a 
solution can be developed but that he is genuinely interested in being 
proactive and taking a position which potentially may not be very different 
from ours.  (The meeting with him will help ferret that out).

My recommendation is that we set up a meeting with him for mid-December and 
go through our issues in a Transmission101 format, since I think he needs to 
go up the learning curve.

Schriber indicated he would try to attend the Nov. 14th meeting in Indy, but 
may be conflicted.  He will make sure PUCO staffers attend.
