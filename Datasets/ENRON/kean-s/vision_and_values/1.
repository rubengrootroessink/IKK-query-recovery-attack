Team, 

Attached is the FINAL draft of the Executive Committee V&V presentation 
scheduled for May 15.

As we agreed to in our April V&V meeting, each V&V rep will meet with their 
Executive Committee member to review the presentation.  Any and all feedback 
concerning the presentation should be forwarded to me by Friday, May 5.  

If I don't hear from you by Friday, May 5, with feedback/changes to the 
presentation, I will assume that you and your Executive Committee member are 
OK with the presentation.  

The presentation will be sent to Ken, Jeff, and Joe on Tuesday, May 9.

Thanks for your immediate attention.

Gina
