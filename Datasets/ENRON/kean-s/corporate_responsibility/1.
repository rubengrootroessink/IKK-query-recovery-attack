Friends---I'm in quite a rush to catch a flight, so keep that in mind if my 
comments aren't as articulate as we might prefer (though I did today again 
speak personally with Lauren by phone, Paula Reiker [by coincidence of 
meeting her alone in the elevator this morning], Steve Kean in person and 
Mark palmer several times in person about this since our conference call 
Friday. I think everyone has a good idea, first hand, of my thinking on this 
matter.

Let's be careful not to try to pit the alleged Yakimas intervening in this 
matter, against the "real" Tribe (even though we know there is divergence in 
their respective  thinkings and radicalism).  This delicate situation can be 
managed and I'm happy to handle it if needed. 
 Keep in mind that Tribes work like most of our dysfunctional families: 
you can tell me something bad about your mother and your brother can give me 
a better opinion about her;  if I don't like your mother and try to use you 
to defend my position against your brother, it's likely both you and your 
brother will team up against me.  "sacred' grounds, even "alleged 'sacred  
grounds' " are somewhat moving targets and somewhat personal--no matter how 
wacky, one Indian wouldn't want to be put in a back-against-the-wall position 
of denying another Indian's claim of sacred grounds.  Yet again let me say, 
this situation between the groups is  manageable and I believe we can, when 
necessary, work with the "real" Tribe in the same, very amicable way we've 
been doing since 1997, to resolve this for the Wind Group should we ever 
decide to go forward.

Here's a red-lined version of my comments.

Thanks--I'll be travelling through Tuesday morning, but can be reached 
through all the usual alternative routes (phone mail is best--3-6117).

Thanks!!---Christie.
