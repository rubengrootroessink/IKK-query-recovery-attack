Steve,

We will get the financial details necessary to continue with the Rice proposal
on Tuesday afternoon.  Traci has set up a meeting with Wil Uecker, Associate
Dean for Executive Education (Jones School), on Tuesday morning where we will 
be
discussing the school's systems and streaming needs.  We should have a better
idea after the meeting on what their needs will be in order to generate some
numbers for you.

Robert Hoodis will be accompanying us during this meeting.  He will help us
assess the cost of e-powering the university and give us some suggestions on 
how
we can extract the necessary revenue out of the deal.

Any questions please call Traci at 3-3242 or me at 5-8141.

Regards,

Jaime E. Gualy
