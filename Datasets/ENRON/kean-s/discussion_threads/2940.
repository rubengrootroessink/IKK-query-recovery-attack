Future Looks Dark for New York Market;=20
NYSEG Outlines Energy Policy

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters] New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one o=
f=20
New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatts t=
o=20
support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSEG, in=
 a=20
report issued late Wednesday, warned there are "serious problems with (New=
=20
York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline=20
infrastructure." The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York=
=20
Independent System Operator (NYISO), which has run the state's wholesale=20
power market since 1999. The NYSEG report, titled ``New York State's Electr=
ic=20
Energy Crisis and NYSEG's Comprehensive Solution,'' criticizes the NYISO fo=
r=20
not giving power consumers "price certainty" in the transition from local=
=20
monopolies to an open, competitive market.=20

Analysis: New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener=
gy=20
markets, as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou=
t=20
an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season.=20
However, unlike California, which basically faces a power supply problem th=
at=20
can be improved over time, New York arguably suffers from a more severe and=
=20
permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved. Like its West=
=20
Coast counterpart, New York also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance a=
nd=20
local resistance that thwarts new generation development. However, even if =
or=20
when power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New=
=20
York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin=
ue=20
to take their own toll on the stability of the market.=20

Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o=
n=20
each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe=
r.=20
As noted, in its new report, NYSEG, a subsidiary of Energy East (NYSE: EAS)=
,=20
is especially critical of NYISO, which it says has contributed to soaring=
=20
wholesale prices in New York. NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining=20
unrealistic goals for new power supply, not providing accurate price signal=
s=20
to energy customers, and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems. =
=20

Yet, beyond the finger pointing, some essential facts can be established, o=
n=20
which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree. According to data included=
=20
in the NYISO report, between 1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New=
=20
York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity under contract in the state=20
increased only by 1,060 MW. New York has not brought a new plant online sin=
ce=20
1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven year=
s=20
since a 1,000 MW unit in Oswego, N.Y. marked the last plant to open upstate=
. =20

In addition, New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks. Deficie=
nt=20
transmission systems in central New York, around New York City and at the=
=20
outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than=
=20
can be imported into the state. New York City is relatively isolated from t=
he=20
transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o=
n=20
city-based power supply. New York City's load should reach 10,535 MW this=
=20
summer alone, requiring 8,428 MW of in-city capacity, along with imports, t=
o=20
meet demand and provide a reserve margin. With a current capacity of 8,132=
=20
MW, there is a potential 296 MW shortfall. These projections presume normal=
=20
weather conditions. If New York experiences a warmer-than-normal summer, th=
e=20
outlook gets even worse. =20

Further, according to a report from New York's State Attorney General,=20
between 1988 and 1998 capital improvements to New York's transmission syste=
m=20
dropped from $307.7 million per year to $90 million per year. At the presen=
t=20
time, only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is=20
scheduled. A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut=20
would provide Long Island with about 300 MW of additional power and increas=
e=20
its import capacity by about 4 percent. Unless this transmission expansion =
is=20
expedited, it is not scheduled for operation until 2002. =20

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York most=
=20
certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th=
e=20
use of air conditioners, pushing demand to annual highs. While NYSEG and th=
e=20
NYISO may agree on the nature of New York's problems, a contentious debate=
=20
has emerged with regard to finding a solution. In its own proposal, release=
d=20
in early March, the NYISO focused on building new generation, expediting=20
siting processes, improving transmission lines, and conservation efforts. I=
n=20
one of its key proposals, the NYISO urged the creation of 8,600 MW of new=
=20
electricity (roughly 30 percent of New York's peak demand) by 2005, with up=
=20
to 5,000 MW of that generation being made available by the end of 2001. =20

NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for "falling short in its assessment o=
f=20
the magnitude of the crisis" and issued its own proposals in its recent=20
report. For instance, NYSEG officials said that NYISO had "grossly=20
oversimplified the situation" and that, considering the tenuous state of=20
power construction in New York, the objective of establishing 8,600 MW by=
=20
2005 was "extremely unrealistic." In turn, NYSEG says that a robust wholesa=
le=20
electric market will not materialize in New York until 2008, assuming that=
=20
measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately. In earl=
y=20
March, NYSEG released the "NYSEGPlan," outlining six steps which it believe=
s=20
"contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition" to a=20
competitive market in New York. In summary, the NYSEGPlan includes:=20

Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants=
.=20
Adding to the state's transmission capacity. =20
Adding to the state's natural-gas supply infrastructure.  =20
Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity.=
=20
Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers, by encouraging=
=20
interruptible load where feasible, and building the technological=20
infrastructure necessary for real-time pricing.=20
Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan, in which electric rates would be=
=20
frozen for seven years, by July 1, 2001.=20

However, while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals, the=
=20
same obstacles inherent in New York's market might also thwart its own ener=
gy=20
plan. For instance, topping the list of NYSEG's six steps is an emphasis on=
=20
establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and=20
approval process. This may be easier said than done. As I mentioned in my=
=20
3/22/01IssueAlert, the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th=
e=20
lobbying force that community groups in California wield. In that column, I=
=20
discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in=
=20
Ramapo, N.Y. (from an 827-MW combined-cycle facility to a 510-MW peaking=20
unit) due to opposition raised by local residents. =20

In addition, just yesterday, a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort=
s=20
by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to build two 44-MW gas-fired=20
generators in the borough of Queens. The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to=
=20
"cease all construction on the units" and ruled that the power authority=20
violated state environmental-review laws to its efforts to rush the plant=
=20
into service by June. In response, NYPA has said that the plants=01*along w=
ith=20
nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York City=01*are need=
ed to=20
prevent power outages this summer. NYPA continues to face fierce opposition=
=20
from community groups (many of them launching lawsuits) who do not want the=
=20
generation units in their neighborhoods. =20

Consequently, the supply / demand imbalance in New York is a very serious=
=20
matter, and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless=
=20
blackouts occur. Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines=
=20
surrounding New York State and New York City are solved, adding new power=
=20
supply (assuming that generation development can move past community=20
opposition) would not be enough to bring more balance to the market. In the=
=20
interim, conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c=
an=20
user to abate power outages this summer, but again the general public may n=
ot=20
fully understand the need to reduce their power usage. =20

New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for near-term=
=20
problems. First, expedite the building of new generation sources (including=
=20
distribution generation alternatives). This assumes that gas lines will be=
=20
sufficient to import necessary fuel. Second, allow the economy of New York=
=20
City to stagnate as a result of the supply / demand imbalance, which will=
=20
drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand. And, third, focu=
s=20
on conservation efforts, which again may not work until residents are=20
directly impacted by outages. The city may choose a combination of all thre=
e=20
approaches or decide to focus on just one. However, to address the immediat=
e=20
concerns, it does not appear that New York has any options besides this=20
three-tier approach.=20

One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne=
w=20
York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture. Although =
it=20
is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated=20
divestiture, utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur=
e=20
to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most =
of=20
their power plants. NYSEG, the author of the new report on New York's power=
=20
problems, is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will=20
remain only in the transmission business. This most likely creates a=20
heightened sensitivity on NYSEG's part with regard to the power supply=20
shortages presently facing New York. Again, we now have two states that=20
represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility=
=20
model becomes dismantled. Of course, it is not fair to say that divestiture=
=20
is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York, but=
=20
taking away a utility's ability to effectively control is own power supply=
=20
costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states. =20
