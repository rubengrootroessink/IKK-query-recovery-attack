9th ANNUAL LECTURE ON ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, 6PM


"Easing California's Electricity Shortage with Buildings that Respond to
Real Time Prices"
Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Ph.D. , State of California Energy Commissioner


Currently, California utilities must buy their marginal electricity from
merchant power plants at prices that range from 10 c/kWh on a cool summer
morning to $1.00/kWh on a hot, stressed afternoon. Yet "retail" rates,
frozen since 1988, require them to re-sell to customers at 13c/kWh, all
afternoon, independent of scarcity.


On a hot day, California peak demand is ~50 GW, of which 29% is for a/c
(air conditioning) and 11% is for lighting in commercial buildings. This
summer supply may fall short by 2-5 GW (4-10%). If commercial customers see
an incentive to curtail their use (via real-time prices and real-time
rewards) they can set up their thermostats by 4 deg. F and dim their lights
to 1/2 (almost nobody notices) for a total ("no sweat") saving of 15%.


Buildings use 2/3 of all electricity. Dr. Rosenfeld will discuss short- and
long-term strategies to make them more efficient and price responsive, and
some other topics covered in a recent Wall Street Journal story at
