Linda:  As discussed before, Senate Energy Committee staff have already begun 
meetings to draft the bipartisan Energy Legislation they plan to introduce at 
the beginning of the 107th Congress.  Their bill will focus on three major 
categories including "supply" (including fuel diversity, and consistent 
natural gas prices regardless of world oil prices, etc.); "infrastructure 
development" (including pipeline construction for gas and liquids, eminent 
domain for electricity transmission, reliability including California plus 
heating oil reserves with concerns regarding the mandatory inventory levels 
precedence set by Massachusetts); and "efficiency" (including tax measures, 
renewables and distributed generation.)

They are working off of the 106th Congress bills S. 2557, S. 2904 and tax 
bills such as S. 2718.  In addition, they are meeting with RUS to discuss 
ideas to fund transmission builds in rural areas so as to eliminate capacity 
restraints.  Further, CRS is writing an "options" paper addressing various 
means to stimulate supply. Finally, they are awaiting BLM's official 
"inventory of the public lands available for development" which shall include 
listings of constraints to development, thus, enabling them to draft 
solutions.

They will likely do the tax issues first and then the access issues after but 
this is not set in stone.  Regardless, now is the time for Enron to supply 
input and innovative solutions to address the issues.  I would suggest the 
need to go over the existing legislation; decide which provisions we like and 
don't like plus offer legislative drafting solutions for provisions we deem 
missing.

As such, shall we proceed with a meeting, conference call, etc.??  Please 
advise.  We have the month of January to compile our legislative wish list 
and convey our ideas to staff.  

As an aside, the House is still addressing Committee Chair and staffing 
issues so are not as far along as the Senate.  However,  Chairman Barton 
expects quick action on energy issues in the 107th.  Thanks.
