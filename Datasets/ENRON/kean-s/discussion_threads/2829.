Steve & Cindy,

Below are a couple emails from our recruiters indicating an increase in Enron 
employees looking at other employment options.  The increased activity seems 
to be more prevalent for EES & EBS.  As I mentioned in my voicemail,  we have 
not seen a significant increase in voluntary turnover, in fact, for ENW it is 
lower this year than it was last year at this time. (Probably has to do with 
the softening of job market and decrease in other opportunities.)  

We are still checking with other recruiters and agencies and will keep you 
posted with updates and any increase in turnover. 

Robert

Spoke to Charles T. His contacts indicate a similar pattern - a definate 
upsurge over the last 4 weeks by around 20-30%. Candidates seem to be 
primarliy from EBS/ EES.

Guys:
As requested, I spoke with a couple of the external vendors that we use on 
the Corp side of the equation.  I posed the question to probe into the number 
of Enron candidates on the street.
According to one of my sources, the number of Enron people who have expressed 
interest in looking into opportunities has increased... although it was her 
feeling that the majority of the people interested in making a change were 
from the less established Enron businesses (Azurix, EES, EBS...).  She said 
that the Chronicle article seemed to trigger this increase.

I will follow up if I get any additional data to share.

Regards,
Tony
