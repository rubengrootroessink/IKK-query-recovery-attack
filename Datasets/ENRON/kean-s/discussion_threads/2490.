Chinese Firm Offers Clinton Two Million Dollars to be "Image" Envoy
BEIJING, Feb 18, 2001 -- (Agence France Presse) A major Chinese garments
firm unveiled Sunday a two-million-dollar offer to Bill Clinton to represent
the company and said he was considering the proposal.
Fapai, a firm specializing in men's garments and based in the freewheeling
Wenzhou city in eastern China's Zhejiang province, had asked Clinton to be
its "image ambassador," a company spokesman said, confirming a Beijing Youth
Daily report.
The company had written to Clinton in May 2000 but the offer was considered
premature by the then U.S. president, the report said.
When the offer was repeated after he left the White House, Hillary Clinton
acknowledged it in a letter, it said.
"Mrs Clinton thanked us on her own and her husband's behalf for the offer
and expressed readiness to discuss it face to face with the company
director," the daily said quoting the firm.
A company spokesman told AFP that Hillary Clinton's letter was received last
week.
Fapai has already roped in top Hong Kong film actor Tony Leung, who made a
name for himself in the French film "L'Amant" directed by Jean-Jacques
Annaud. ((c) 2001 Agence France Presse)
