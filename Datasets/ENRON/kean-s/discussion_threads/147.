Note they backed off on not lettting us be a sink but again changed the 
language relating to the 20 min.  They assure us verbally that they intend to 
honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed 
in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement 
again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also 
refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but 
replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  
Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement 
I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where 
they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and 
NERC.

Dick/Jim
Here is an agreement that we can accept if SERC and Enron approves.  It is
my belief that it is consistent with the agreement reached in SERC/Atlanta
last week.  We have tried to accomodate Enron's concerns related to
"non-binding" and "for IDC purposes only" in the lead-in paragraph.  We do
not think it is appropriate to address Gleason at this time -- we should get
some operating experience with the present sites and see where the CATF is
going.  Gleason will not be operational until next year.
Thanks

Gail -- please the FAX agreement and e-mail to Terry at his hotel
