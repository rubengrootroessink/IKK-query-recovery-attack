)

IM Strategy Proposal.
Steve Kean joined the task force for a project review and to discuss if one=
=20
executive sponsor and one senior coordinator for IM should be appointed.  P=
er=20
Steve's recommendation, the task force should consider Steve as the executi=
ve=20
sponsor for the project.  No senior coordinator for the effort will be=20
appointed until some incremental successes are achieved.  Steve referenced=
=20
the Louise Kitchen/Enron Online experience where Louise and team, independe=
nt=20
of their day jobs, developed and launched Enron Online without budget or=20
traditional sponsorship.  We should continue operating in this vein.  Steve=
=20
will be available to place calls to the BU/FUs to rally support.  Our focus=
=20
should remain on identifying and developing sticky portal applications to=
=20
improve the flow of information which ultimately should increase the flow o=

happen.
