Hi Maureen, 

I've tried to send an e-mail to Steve at S.Kean and Steve.Kean and both 
e-mails were returned to me as undeliverable.  Will you please forward this 
to Steve for me? 

Thanks.

Hi Steve,

Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on 
Enron's videos.

You asked me whether or not our new "Pro-Sumer" field production equipment 
can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has 
a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file 
storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download 
moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, 
you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know 
that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the 
technology and let you know when it has been developed.

I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet 
talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon.

I forgot to mention one thing to you about the "creative piggybacking" 
money-saving idea:  using a contractor to coordinate/piggyback video shoots 
is exactly what Microsoft does.  When we interviewed Steve Ballmer in 
January, we went to Microsoft's facilities and used Microsoft's crew.  Then 
they invoiced us for a whopping $1800.00 (for fewer than 15 minutes of 
shooting time).  

Steve, I hope that as your thoughts progress about Enron's video needs, 
you'll consider me to be part of the team.  I would like to help develop and 
be a part of the solutions.  

Beth Stier
