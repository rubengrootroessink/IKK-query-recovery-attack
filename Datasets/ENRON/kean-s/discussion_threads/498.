Richard,

Per our conversation please find attached a brief introduction to Downstream 
Originations, the crux of our efforts, and a contact list.
We continue to benefit from increased contact with your staff, and look 
forward to working together on more projects.

Kindly amend if necessary and distribute to all concerned.  I have confirmed 
to Ginger that I am available to make a presentation at your June 8/9 meeting 
as well.

Regards,

Wendy King
