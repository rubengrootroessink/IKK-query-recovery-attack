The attached filing will be made at the CPUC later today related to EES' 
claims on the Negative CTC - PX Credits.  The lawyers are continuing to 
refine the document.  The discussion about how big the $ is will be deleted.  

This does not get at PG&E's claim that the rate freeze had ended and 
therefore the PX Credit was not applicable.
