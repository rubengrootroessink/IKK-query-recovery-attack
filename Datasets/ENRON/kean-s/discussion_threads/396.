          - Investor Relations Magazine Recognizes Excellence in 
        Corporate Investor Relations At Fifth-Annual U.S. Awards -    

NEW YORK, March 31 /PRNewswire/ -- General Electric was recognized
for "Best Overall Investor Relations" by a mega-cap company at an awards
gala held in New York last night by Investor Relations magazine and
BARRON'S, the Dow Jones Business and Financial Weekly. The winners
were announced for the fifth-annual Investor Relations Magazine U.S.
Awards, which recognize excellence in investor relations among public
companies.

Winners were determined from a survey of over 1,800 U.S. portfolio
managers, securities analysts, and -- for the first time -- retail investors 
who
are subscribers to Barron's Online. Respondents were asked to rate
companies and investor relations officers in 20 categories ranging from
management of disclosure to IR web sites. The survey was conducted for
Investor Relations by Erdos & Morgan, using lists supplied by The Carson
Group. 

"Investor Relations Magazine is proud of our awards and the exhaustive
research that goes into them. They have quickly become known as the
worldwide barometer for investor relations practices," said Neil Stewart,
Investor Relations' Editor-in-Chief. "The need for strong communications
with investors in this ever-changing, fast-paced economy leads public
companies to rely more than ever on the expertise of investor relations
practitioners for the delivery of accurate financial information." 

The winner of the BARRON'S Grand Prix Award for Best Overall Investor
Relations for companies with a market capitalization of over $30 billion was
General Electric. 

Accepting the award on behalf of General Electric was investor relations
officer Mark Vachon. Also awarded the Grand Prix were Staples in the
large-cap category ($10-30 billion market cap), Exodus Communications in
the $2.5-10 billion range, and Calpine Corp. in the small-cap category. 

A free, one-hour teleconference seminar at 12:00 p.m. EST will feature the
award winners discussing the recent investment community survey,
strategies and tactics from their winning IR programs, and forecasts of
industry developments on the horizon. Those interested should dial
800-475-0222, using 'cyberseminar' when prompted for the passcode. For
the accompanying Internet conference, log onto
http://www.emeetings.wcom.com/cyberseminar. Participants will be
prompted to enter 'CYBERSEMINAR' (all caps) for the seminar name and
passcode.
