HEADLINE: SDG&E Seeks $16 Million for Energy-Efficiency Assistance for 
Customers 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, July 24, 2000 

BODY: 
 
To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next, San 
Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has requested from the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC) $16 million over the next two years to increase 
funding for energy-efficiency programs.
"Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and 
today's proposal will bring an additional $16 million funding to encourage 
energy conservation in our region," said Edwin A. Guiles, president of SDG&E. 
"This money can be used to help replace old, inefficient appliances, such as 
air conditioners and refrigerators, which will result in reduced electric 
bills and less strain on our state's electric-supply system."
Of the $16 million, SDG&E would allocate an additional $4.3 million 
exclusively for low-income energy-efficiency assistance programs over the 
next two years.  
Under the proposal filed Friday, the low-income assistance funds will be used 
to expand existing programs, such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler 
replacements, while introducing new programs, including room air-conditioner 
replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair. The program also 
includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air 
conditioners in rental units.
The rest of the money would go into other energy-efficiency programs to 
provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second 
refrigerators; refrigerator and room air-conditioner replacement; replacement 
of inefficient pool pumps; and increased incentives for a variety of programs 
to benefit small businesses.
Funds for these additional incentives come from 1999 programs that did not 
draw as much customer participation as expected. For instance, large 
customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed 
to provide energy-efficiency incentives to them.
Details on the programs are still being developed, but they should be in 
place in early September. The CPUC is expected to act on SDG&E's filing in 
late August.
In California's newly created competitive energy marketplace, SDG&E is a 
delivery-service provider. For those customers who have not chosen another 
energy service provider, SDG&E buys electricity from the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) and passes that cost directly onto its customers, with no 
mark-up. The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the 
open market. Over the last several weeks, SDG&E customers have seen their 
electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity 
costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states.
Friday's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDG&E has taken 
recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices.
On July 20, SDG&E and the Cal-PX proposed a new market-based power bidding 
solution to the CPUC that would allow SDG&E to procure power for customers 
with less price volatility over the next five to nine months.
On July 14, SDG&E filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of 
$100 million in customer money from a CPUC-controlled account. The CPUC's 
approval of SDG&E's request would release of money acquired from 
power-generating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other 
assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by 
$34, or $17 a month.
That proposal, combined with the deregulation-dividend checks most SDG&E 
customers will receive next month, will result in a total of about $500 
million benefit to them in August and September -- nearly$300 for the typical 
residential customer -- helping to ease cash-flow problems from higher 
electricity prices.
The company is actively promoting a level-pay program to all customers, which 
enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year, so 
they can manage better against their monthly household budget. Those 
customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are 
comparable to last summer's bills.
SDG&E also has increased communications to both residential and business 
customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace, available 
energy-efficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills.
Information about these programs is available by calling 1-800-411-SDGE.
San Diego Gas & Electric is a public utility that provides service to 3
