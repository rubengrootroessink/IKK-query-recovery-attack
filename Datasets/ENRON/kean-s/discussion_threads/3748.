Mark -

thanks for the response.

I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi=
th=20
either a specific asset (e.g., Sutton Bridge) or a trading book (e.g., UK=
=20
gas) is impossible.  We could have 50 people spending 100% of their time=20
sitting around dreaming up 'what-ifs' and still not see everything.  On the=
=20
other hand, as your team does now, once we have been able to identify=20
reasonable risks, it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute /=20
calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks. =20

On the flip side of the risk coin, the process of identifying Regulatory Ri=
sk=20
should also allow Govt Affairs, working with our business colleagues,  to=
=20
identify rule changes / policy changes that could positively impact our=20
bottom line.  For instance, we could push through regulatory action for a=
=20
retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin.

I don't disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business=
=20
risks.  But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli=
cy=20
(taxes, export/import, rates, etc.).  Because Enron is actively participati=
ng=20
in many regulated or semi-regulated environments, regulatory risks are=20
business risks. =20

Finally, it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in=
=20
assisting our business people in managing these risks.  To this end, the=20
Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of=20
responsibilities for Govt Affairs:

_ To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets.=20
_ To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks.=20
_ To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris=
k.
_ To assess and compute =01&value at risk=018 for each Regulatory Risk.
_ To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk (e.g., insurance).
_ To propose and/or plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks.
_ To assign EGA and/or commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati=
on=20
efforts.
_ To review mitigation efforts against existing plans.
_ To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk (e.g., BIT=
).
_ To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events (> $25 MM).=20
_ To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position.=20
_ To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron.

I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this=20
further.  Like you, I don't want to create some process that provides littl=
e=20
to no value.

yes, let's meet.  I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary.

I would suggest the hardest part is "anticipating" these changes.  here are=

some examples:  UK Climate Change Levy, even other Government Departments i=

the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor=20

modified without prior notice.  In Romania, Doug Wood met with the Energy=

Minister on the proposed Gas Decree, and 2 days later they passed another=

draft of the decree, which had been rejected before Christmas, verbatim.  T=

Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo, which=
=20
affects all of our UK assets, can swing up or down by 10% per annum, and=20
cannot be predicted/modelled (we and our consultants have tried).  Decision=
s=20
by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland, notwithstanding=
=20
our PPA, was another example.  The list goes on.  I remain a sceptic that a=
ll=20
of these risks, or even many of them, can be "identified" a priori.  Once w=
e=20

"business" risks, that the regulatory team responds to.   mcs    =20

Mark --

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of=20
Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory=
=20
Risk is a "legal" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies=
=20
Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in=
=20
the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxe=
s=20
and export - import policies.  Political Risk is a "supra-legal" action tha=
t=20
has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is tryi=
ng=20
to put in place a "standard" process to review and analyze regualtory risk=
=20
around the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Ri=
sk=20
Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements =
of=20
any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3)=20
mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that th=
e=20
most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri=
sk=20
event.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an=20
assigned person to "manage" our activities so that Enron does not face an=
=20
associated loss.

My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would=20
include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the=20
reason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals.=
=20

When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and=
=20
go through my thoughts with you. =20

Thanks.

Subject: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets

Rick & Mark --

One of the first steps in building our Regulatory Risk process is to=20
establish responsibility for the current assets owned/managed by Enron. =20
Having a point person that I can contact will help me immensely.

Attached is a listing of the assets that I have been able to pull together =
--=20
there may be more that you know about.

Is it possible for us to agree upon the person(s) who will manage the=20
Regulatory Risk with each of these assets?  Please feel free to call me to=
=20
discuss.

I would like to have this assignment process complete within the month.

The same type of effort will be necessary as we review pending transactions=
.

Thanks.
