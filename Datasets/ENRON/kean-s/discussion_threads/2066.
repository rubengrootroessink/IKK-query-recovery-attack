Attached is a picture of the latest addition to our family.  Cisco is a
boxer that we rescued last week from the Albq. animal shelter.  He appears
to have been mistreated, or at least not well cared for.  We seem to be
adjusting to him well...he has attached himself to Diane and follows her
every where.  He crys when he can't get to her or when she leaves.
