FYI - Below is a nice gesture from an Aquilla representative at the SERC 
Board Mtg.  He obviously agrees wholeheartedly with the position Enron staked 
out at the meeting.  

Jim - This is the same guy from Aquilla I was antoganizing at the FPL offices 
on Tuesday evening.

Kevin,

Thanks for the NERC letter you provided me yesterday.  I have share that
with some people around here and no one can figure out how anyone can
interpret it different that you did.  It appears to us the issue has clearly
been resolved.  I have passed your name onto our VP of assets should he want
to pick your brain on dealing with TVA on these issues.  Once again congrats
on your victory against TVA and thanks for the info you shared with me.

Regards,
Jeff
