CERA occasionally produces research directed to a particular set of issues, 
and seeks client feedback prior to the finalization of certain research 
Reports.? As one of our valued clients most directly involved with these 
issues, we welcome your comments and candid observations on the attached 
report titled "Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the 
State's Economy?".

This report, being produced with the involvement of UCLA's Anderson Forecast 
contains interesting and compelling conclusions about the long-term energy 
solutions for California and Western North America, and their related 
long-term economic effects.

We look forward to your comments and observations, and we strongly request 
that no part of this report be reproduced or furnished to the media in any
