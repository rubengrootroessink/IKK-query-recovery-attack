  The home page of Enron.com invites visitors to "discover the power of
why." It then asks them to click and enter a Shockwave movie that lays
out an argument for choosing Enron's products. Market context, solution
and benefit to customer are explained and then backed up with a
slam-dunk quote from a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. It's a smart
marketing approach by a company that is on a very good run.

  The cause of that good run -- Enron was rated Fortune magazine's Most
Innovative Company for the fourth consecutive year -- is the company's
belief in the inherent wisdom of open markets, said Mark Palmer,
VP-corporate communications for Enron Corp.
  "We are about reliability and price," Palmer said. "We believe in the
strength of markets vs. the strength of proprietary markets."

  That "open" brand is conveyed in its Web image -- informative, easy to
navigate and engaging even to those scared off by complexity. A reader
can learn much from a casual click-through.

  Enron.com has thrown existing markets for energy products wide open
and created markets for products such as weather derivatives that did
not exist a few years ago.

  One area of the site allows buyers and sellers to close deals in
850-plus flavors of energy. Called Enrononline.com, the section, which
opened last November, has already logged transactions valued at $125
billion.

  Enron is a "principal" that both buys and sells energy. Through the
site, the company can fulfill customized requests for energy delivery by
assembling the order from various providers. Enron operates horizontally
in the market, picking and choosing among various providers.

  Palmer offers this advice to others seeking to make a market online:
"First create the commercial business of the site, then focus your
communications around the commercial core."
