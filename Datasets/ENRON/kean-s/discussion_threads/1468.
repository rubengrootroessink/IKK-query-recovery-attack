Steve, I had some time this afternoon, so I have called the executive 
assistants myself.  Most have some sort of org charts (see ENA below), but 
many have only business unit "executive committee" charts and do not go 
further in the organization.  I'll forward to you what I've received (several 
e-mails will follow).  Once you've had a chance to look at them, let me know 
what you think.  SRS
