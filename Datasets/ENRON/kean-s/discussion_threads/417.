This is an excerpt from FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs 
(eventually became Rule 2000).  It references the 3/98 petition that Enron, 
etal filed at FERC (which includes examples).  I forwarded you the 3/98 
petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson.  I thought she may be 
interested in this.

Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 -         

     In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power

     industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on

     electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not

     addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that

     Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific

     allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the

     Petition asserts:

          Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles
          for obstructing and curtailing, rather than
          accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to
          deny new entrants access to critical, accurate
          information across control areas.  This can take the
          form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in
          some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. 
          Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability

          Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23.

     112/ Id. at 28.

     113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users,
          including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric
          Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power
          Marketing, Inc.

     114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry
          Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or
          Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket
          No. RM98-5-000.

          is physically available than is being released for
          sale. [115/]

     The Petition alleges the existence of "ATC exclusions,

     inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to

     evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable

     access to the grid." 116/  The Petition cited specific instances

     of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by

     the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in

     fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC

     but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/

          EPSA, the trade association representing certain power

     suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed

     many of the same experiences:

          EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists
          principally because of the continuing incentives and
          opportunity for transmission owning public utilities
          covertly to discriminate against other transmission
          customers, by, for example, minimizing reported
          available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or
          inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise
          manipulating market operations. 118/

     EPSA further stated that, "The manipulation of ATC -- whether

     with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS

     management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power

     suppliers." 119/

          At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told

     by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo

     City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered

     to be discriminatory treatment:

          Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first
          hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued
          ability to use its ownership and control [of]
          transmission to disadvantage competitors,
          notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of
          non-discriminatory transmission access. 

     The representative then went on to describe an instance where a

     marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of

     transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider

     offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative

     concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated

     undue discrimination and this will not be achieved "as long as

     transmission owners are allowed to fence in

     transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their

     transmission system to enhance the value of their generation

     assets at increased cost to competitors." 


     119/ Id. at 8.

     120/ Comments of Robert D. Priest on behalf of the Public Service
          Commission of Yazoo City, Regional ISO Conference (New
          Orleans), Transcript at 201-03.  After hearing this
          assertion, Entergy Services, Inc. filed a letter in which it
          stated that it was unable to identify any Entergy-imposed
          restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase. 
          See Letter in Docket No. PL98-5-000 (filed July 2, 1998). 


          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 75 -         

          One specific area where there have been allegations that

     transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant

     operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit

     Margin (CBM).  Although there is no single accepted definition,

     CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer

     capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to

     generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation

     reliability requirements. 121/  Some utilities subtract CBM from

     their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC.  There is

     no uniform method for calculating CBM.  The ability to withhold

     CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability

     advantage for the transmission provider, but may give the

     transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC

     over paths and interconnections useful to its generation

     competitors.  

          The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being

     considered in several cases pending before the Commission. 122/ 

     For example, with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO, the

     Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pool's

     historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface

     capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is


     121/ NERC, Available Transfer Capability Definitions and
          Determinations (June 1996), at 14.

     122/ The Commission recently noticed a technical conference, to
          be held May 20 and 21, 1999, on the issue of CBM.  See
          Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission
          Capacity, Notice of Technical Conference, Docket No. EL99-
          46-000.


          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 76 -         

     consistent with our open access policies.  The Commission

     observed that the load serving entities that own generating

     capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from

     this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load

     serving entities. 123/  The Commission set the issue for further

     briefing and it remains pending.  In another pending proceeding

     concerning WPSC's CBM calculation, two of the parties assert that

     CBM "removes firm transmission capacity from open access

     offerings, thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable

     barrier to competition," and "fosters discrimination by giving

     merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBM-related

     transmission access and by giving individual interface

     transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM

     is withdrawn from ATC." 124/  In the same proceeding, Electric

     Clearinghouse, Inc. asserts that "the CBM set-aside embodies

     undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission

     wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the

     reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of

     other firm transmission users." 125/

          As we stated above, we fully recognize that these are

     assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made

     suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for
