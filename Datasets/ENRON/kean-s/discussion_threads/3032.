Tough talk on energy: Many Democratic lawmakers push to seize generators.
By Jim Sanders
BEE CAPITOL BUREAU
(Published April 16, 2001)=20
Here's what some California lawmakers see as a trump card in solving the=20
state's energy crisis: Gouge the public, lose your power plant.=20
Faced with growing bills and dwindling options, many Democratic lawmakers a=
re=20
pushing for the use of emergency powers or eminent domain to force power=20
generators to negotiate lower wholesale electricity prices.=20
"Step One is to seize a few power plants," said Senate President Pro Tem Jo=
hn=20
Burton, D-San Francisco. "That would let (the generators) know we mean=20
business."=20
"There's no negotiation when generators say, 'Pay us what we want, or we'll=
=20
shut off California's lights,' " said Phil Angelides, state treasurer. "We=
=20
ought to levy an excess profit tax, and if they don't take their foot off o=
ur=20
throat, seize a plant or two to sober them up."=20
The increasingly tough talk about seizing assets, while motivated by an=20
immediate desire to extract concessions, fits into a longer-term push for=
=20
California to produce some of its own electricity to boost supply and prote=
ct=20
against spiraling prices.=20
Critics blast the notion of seizure, however, as a bargaining ploy or=20
political grandstanding.=20
"It's actually quite silly and a waste of time to consider these options,"=
=20
said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, =
an=20
association of wholesale generators.=20
"Seizure would mean the state would pay top dollar for an Edsel -- old, tir=
ed=20
plants that are past their prime," he said. "What happens if these people a=
re=20
wrong and they're taking the people of California down a dead end?"=20
But others say the time is ripe for radical reform, with the state paying u=
p=20
to $50 million a day for electricity and facing prospects of rolling power=
=20
blackouts this summer.=20
"The generators will only respond when we take their golden eggs: the plant=
s=20
they own," said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
=20
Rights. "They're the ones cheating us, and they're the ones we must target.=
"=20
Lawmakers have raised the following two seizure possibilities, each aimed a=
t=20
ensuring that more electricity is available at lower than spot-market price=
s:=20
Take over private power plants, perhaps contract with utilities to run them=
=20
and let the courts decide what fair market price should be paid to the=20
companies that now own them.=20
Leave the plants alone, but seize their contracts with marketers, thus=20
controlling where the power is sold while reducing price markups by=20
eliminating the middleman in spot-market transactions.=20
State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, chairwoman of the state Senate's=
=20
Energy Committee, recently suggested a third way for California to acquire=
=20
existing electricity assets, without seizing them: Purchase the entire=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in Bankruptcy Court.=20
Such a move could benefit the state and keep PG&E property out of the hands=
=20
of private companies that already have too much influence over the=20
electricity market, Bowen said.=20
All sides agree that takeovers would be an extraordinary, unprecedented=20
intervention into California's electricity industry.=20
But Burton said his support for seizures is "very serious." The state could=
=20
pay acquisition costs through revenue from electricity sales, he said.=20
"People make money on power plants," he said. "It ain't like they're loss=
=20
leaders."=20
Gov. Gray Davis hasn't ruled out the seizure of power generators' assets or=
=20
the acquisition of PG&E. But such possibilities raise a million questions,=
=20
ranging from taxpayer exposure to technical issues regarding use of any ass=
et=20
acquired, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.=20
Seizure, in particular, can be a "risky gamble" that should not be done in=
=20
haste, Maviglio said. Private companies targeted by the state could respond=
=20
by withholding power or deciding not to invest in new plants at a time when=
=20
California is scrambling for more electricity.=20
"Clearly, the governor doesn't want to send a message that California doesn=
't=20
want increased generation," Maviglio said. "Even though generators are=20
gouging us now, they're also the people that build plants."=20
While the Democratic governor has not committed himself to seizure, he=20
supports legislation -- SB 6x -- written by Burton and supported by Angelid=
es=20
that would create a public power authority to construct state-owned plants=
=20
and help finance conservation and renewable-energy projects.=20
"The notion that we should let electricity be traded by profiteers like a=
=20
sheer commodity is ludicrous and dangerous," Angelides said. "Public power =
is=20
the public's defense against the greed and dysfunction of a market run amok=
."=20
Power plants aren't cheap, but with the $5.2 billion it has spent or=20
allocated since January to buy energy on the spot market, the state could=
=20
generate enough electricity to serve more than 10 million homes. A=20
1,000-megawatt plant burning natural gas would cost about $500 million,=20
according to the California Energy Commission.=20
"We ought never again be in the position of having no ability to control at=
=20
least part of the supply and hedge the market," said Darrell Steinberg,=20
D-Sacramento, a member of the Assembly's Energy Committee.=20
S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water an=
d=20
Power and an adviser to Davis, said he solidly supports building public=20
plants. He likes the idea of a windfall profits tax but is less enthusiasti=
c=20
about asset seizures.=20
"All those things are worth considering and they're part of a common theme:=
=20
The state has to take control of its own destiny," Freeman said. "We need t=
o=20
conserve and build our way out of this mess. The Lord helps those who help=
=20
themselves."=20
But Republican legislators, who have long opposed Davis' efforts to buy=20
statewide electricity transmission, think the state would be making a big=
=20
mistake by seizing private plants or building its own.=20
"There's no reason to believe the state of California can run the power=20
business or the transmission business as good as, or better than, the priva=
te=20
sector," said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.=20
The concept of seizure is particularly controversial.=20
"How far can you take this?" Cox asked. "If we have a natural gas shortage,=
=20
do we then seize those pipelines?"=20
Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association said state=
=20
officials need to stop their "constant haranguing of generators."=20
"Seizing private property didn't work in Cuba, and I don't think it would=
=20
work in California," he said.=20
Private electricity companies are investing billions to generate more power=
,=20
and are running their plants as hard as possible to meet the crisis,=20
Smutny-Jones said.=20
Soaring electricity prices have been due largely to high demand, scarce=20
supply, extremely high costs for natural gas to run turbines, and financial=
=20
risks tied to the instability of PG&E and Southern California Edison,=20
industry officials say.=20
But state officials claim that market manipulation has contributed as well.=
=20
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the statewide=20
transmission grid, has accused power generators of overcharging Californian=
s=20
by $6.2 billion since May.=20
In response, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently threatened t=
o=20
order generators to refund a portion of the contested charges, $134.8=20
million, mostly covering state purchases in January and February.=20
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp., a North Carolina-based=20
company that operates four California power plants, said the company is=20
spending $1.6 billion to upgrade and expand those facilities in an attempt =
to=20
ease the energy crunch.=20
State seizures would discourage investment and hurt the industry, Williams=
=20
said.=20
"The governor has said that two things need to happen: The state needs more=
=20
supply and lower prices," he said. "Seizing power plants would do nothing t=
o=20
help those two objectives."=20
Any attempt to take Duke's property through eminent domain would spark a=20
lawsuit, Williams said. "We would fight it vigorously, I can assure you, to=
=20
ensure we got fair market value."=20
But Duke would not object to the state building power plants of its own, he=
=20
said.=20
"We support any effort, public or private, to add generation to California,=
"=20
he said. "The state needs it -- and needs it fast."=20

(Published April 16, 2001)=20
Gray Davis is, by his own description, a cautious, incremental and=20
consensus-oriented politician. One might expect, therefore, that he would b=
e=20
circumspect in what he says, as well as what he does.=20
The state's energy crisis, however, is offering new evidence of Davis' odd,=
=20
even inexplicable, penchant for saying things that don't square with either=
=20
reality or sensibility. It's not the same as President Bush's malapropisms.=
=20
Davis knows what he's saying; he just doesn't know, or doesn't care, how=20
ludicrous his words strike others.=20
Take, for example, something Davis said three years ago as he was announcin=
g=20
his candidacy for governor. In a feeble attempt to be inspiring -- not easy=
=20
for a politician whose name captures his personality -- Davis quoted from a=
n=20
inscription engraved into a state office building.=20
The inscription is "Bring me men to match my mountains," but Davis changed =
it=20
to "Bring me people to match my mountains" as a gesture to feminists, and=
=20
then placed it on the wrong building. To Davis, being politically correct w=
as=20
more important than being accurate.=20
Davis had been governor for just six months when he uttered something so=20
outrageous that it continues to reverberate. In a meeting with newspaper=20
editors in San Francisco, Davis castigated the Legislature, which is=20
controlled by his fellow Democrats, as having "a totally different view of=
=20
the world than I do, totally different," and then added: "People expect=20
government to reflect the vision that I suggested. Nobody else in the=20
Legislature ran statewide. Their job is to implement my vision. That is the=
ir=20
job."=20
To put it mildly, legislators were miffed by this pungent whiff of=20
megalomania, which also disregarded American concepts of government, and=20
Davis had to do some serious fence-mending in subsequent weeks. But did he=
=20
learn his lesson about saying things that implied he is the center of the=
=20
political universe? Apparently not.=20
Nine months later, Davis said much the same thing about the courts, telling=
=20
reporters in Washington that he expects his appointees to the bench to foll=
ow=20
his lead on the death penalty and other issues or resign. Davis said that=
=20
"while they (judges) have to follow the law =01( they're there because I=20
appointed them and they need to keep faith with my electoral mandate."=20
Another round of explanations and clarifications followed.=20
The governor has uttered so many odd, and ultimately unrealistic, statement=
s=20
about the energy crisis this year that a Republican group now collects and=
=20
distributes them. In January, he pledged that "there will be no rate=20
increases," even though he and a state Public Utilities Commission controll=
ed=20
by his appointees now say hefty rate boosts are necessary. Repeatedly, he h=
as=20
declared that an end to the crisis was in sight, only to see the state=20
plummet even further into the abyss. His promise of a short-term state powe=
r=20
purchase program has now become an immense and prolonged drain on the state=
=20
treasury. And projections of significant new power generation and=20
conservation savings to get the state through the summer are being downgrad=
ed=20
severely.=20
During one particularly effusive period in late February, Davis said=20
California is "on the back side of the crisis," pledged that "the combinati=
on=20
of rapid efforts to put more megawatts on line and conservation will get us=
=20
through the summer," and declared that the state is within a month of=20
completing all the "legislative fixes" needed to settle the crisis.=20
But perhaps Davis' most enduring February declaration was this one: "Believ=
e=20
me, if I wanted to raise rates, I could have solved this problem in 20=20
minutes." Maybe that was true in February. But Davis continued to dither an=
d=20
the rates are being raised now without any indication that the crisis will =
go=20
away anytime soon. Given his record, we should view all of Davis'=20
pronouncements with a strong sense of skepticism.=20

But hours before the scheduled departure came an unexpected twist: a blacko=

of his own.=20
Cardoza, a Merced Democrat, resides on a 36-foot Gulf Star watercraft=20
anchored along the Sacramento River during the week.=20
He and other lawmakers had planned to take a 5:30 a.m. chartered flight to=

While Cardoza woke up on time -- thanks to a battery-powered alarm clock --=

he faced other problems. "He had to take a really, really cold bath with=20

SDG&E has rebates for conservers of energy=20




By Karen Kucher=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 15, 2001=20
Doris Tuley of El Cajon no longer switches on her TV during the day. She=20
turns on so few lights she has to squint to read, and does her laundry only=
=20
at night.=20
"We are cutting back -- and yet the bill keeps going up," she said.=20
Last week, Tuley, 63, found another way to save. She took six halogen=20
torchiere lamps to La Mesa's Porter Hall to exchange for fluorescent lamps,=
=20
which use less electricity.=20

The replacements were free, provided by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. under =
an=20
outreach program for seniors.=20
It is one of many rebates and incentives offered by the utility, which is=
=20
spending about $50 million to encourage residents and businesses to conserv=
e=20
energy.=20
In the market for a new refrigerator? Consumers who purchase energy-saving=
=20
models can pocket up to $125. Buying the right dishwasher could get you a $=
50=20
rebate, while $75 is available for those who purchase qualified clothes=20
washers.=20
SDG&E also offers rebates for homeowners who install insulation,=20
energy-efficient windows, new gas water heaters or energy-saving swimming=
=20
pool pumps. Apartment building owners can get incentives to retrofit=20
appliances in units, and developers who build homes that don't waste power=
=20
can get money, too.=20
The utility has offered programs promoting efficiency and conservation sinc=
e=20
the 1970s, with rebates and other costs covered by ratepayer fees, said Yol=
e=20
Whiting, SDG&E's director of consumer programs and services.=20
Surge in interest
Such incentives have gained new importance in recent months, as skyrocketin=
g=20
prices and blackouts have become a reality for Californians.=20
Consumers have been flooding the utility's Web site (http://www.sdge.com) a=
nd=20
phone lines to find more information.=20
"In the past, I can remember when it was hard to convince folks that they=
=20
needed to save energy," Whiting said. "We are getting a lot of response and=
 a=20
lot of interest now."=20
SDG&E is trying to encourage its customers to reduce total demand by 75=20
megawatt-hours or more during 2001.=20
If it creates a 23 megawatt-hour reduction and meets other goals, it will=
=20
receive a $2.7 million incentive payment from the state Public Utilities=20
Commission, Whiting said.=20
The 23 megawatt-hours are enough to meet the demands of 17,250 households.=
=20
Managers of stores that sell appliances say they have seen a rise in=20
refrigerator sales in the first quarter of the year, which they believe is=
=20
related to California's energy crisis.=20
Consumers are particularly interested in finding appliances carrying the=20
Energy Star label of the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental=
=20
Protection Agency because those appliances save the most energy and qualify=
=20
for rebates.=20
"A lot of people don't understand Energy Star, but they do understand energ=
y=20
efficiency," said Harry Overlock, who manages the Sears store in El Cajon.=
=20
Energy expert Michael Lamb said a 10-year-old refrigerator may use twice as=
=20
much power as a new model.=20
"Modern refrigerator technology has come a long way in 10 years," said Lamb=
,=20
a certified energy manager at Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy=20
Clearinghouse, a program operated by the U.S. Department of Energy.=20
"As a general rule of thumb, a modern refrigerator of the same size with=20
similar features will use about half the amount of power as one made about =
10=20
years ago, and about a third of the power of one made about 15 years ago.=
=20
"The technology has just gotten a whole lot better," he said.=20
Lamb said newer models offer better compressor motors and evaporation fan=
=20
motors, more intelligent controls and better insulation.=20
Shop carefully
Although those models can be more expensive, consumers like them because th=
e=20
rebate defrays some of the initial cost and because the long-term energy=20
savings are attractive.=20
However, a representative from the Utility Consumers' Action Network=20
public-interest group warned consumers to research rebates before they shop=
=20
for appliances.=20
A UCAN intern who recently went to several local stores found that many=20
salespeople seemed unfamiliar with rebate programs and didn't know what=20
models qualified for them, said Jodi Beebe, an energy analyst with UCAN.=20
"The best thing to do is do it with foresight," Beebe said.=20
Sears' Overlock said he thinks rebates encourage consumers to replace=20
inefficient appliances -- and he'd like to see more offered.=20
Bill Walker, manager of the Home Depot in Grantville, says his customers ar=
e=20
buying everything in the store related to energy efficiency.=20

Utilities to Resume Paying Producers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--The state's two biggest utilities are scheduled to resume=

paying hundreds of small power producers this week, but at least some=20
producers say they plan to remain offline.
?????Jay Henneberry, an attorney representing a small gas-fired power plant=
=20
in Oxnard, said his client does not plan to start generating electricity=20
again for Southern California Edison today, because of a controversial new=
=20
rate plan that he said would force his client to operate at a loss.
?????The company, EF Oxnard Inc., sued Edison last week, alleging that the=
=20
utility owes it more than $13.5 million for past electricity deliveries. Th=
e=20
lack of payment, according to EF Oxnard officials, prompted natural gas=20
suppliers to cut them off in February, forcing Oxnard to stop producing=20
electricity.
?????Henneberry noted that the new rate plan fails to address the utilities=

billion.
?????"Those payments are only on a going-forward basis," Henneberry said.=
=20
"They do nothing for $13.5 million owed to my client."
?????The situation underscores the problems the state faces as it tries to=

get California's nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewable energy=
=20
paid and, in cases such as EF Oxnard, back in business.
?????These companies, which include producers of solar, wind and thermal=20
power, provide more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in Californi=
a.=20
But their output has been cut by as much as half in recent weeks due in par=
t=20
to the payment problems.
?????A new rate plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission last month=
=20
to help get those producers paid has triggered a growing number of gas-fire=
d=20
power producers to sue Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison to get out of thei=

force them to operate at a loss, because it does not adequately compensate=

them for rising natural gas costs.
?????"We are not going to run our plants if we can't run them profitably,"=
=20
said Marty Quinn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of=
=20
Ridgewood Power LLC, which owns three small gas-fired generators in=20
California that are not operating.
?????In a related matter, a hearing is scheduled today in a legal battle=20
between Edison and a small geothermal producer. An Imperial County judge=20
previously freed CalEnergy from its contract with Edison because of the=20
utility's failure to pay the company, which has since been selling its=20
supplies on the wholesale power market.
?????The court is expected to rule today on CalEnergy's request for roughly=
=20
$100 million in payments it is owed by Edison, and could also act on an=20
Edison request that Cal- Energy be required to resume selling power to the=
=20
utility.
?????"If Edison shows that it is credit-worthy and capable of making paymen=
ts=20
on a going-forward basis, I'm sure the judge will take that into account,"=
=20
said CalEnergy official Jonathan Weisgall. "But one of our concerns is how=
=20
long will Edison continue to make these payments."
?????An official with Sierra Pacific Industries, which received court=20
permission earlier this month to sell power generated by six plants it owns=
=20
in California to a buyer other than PG&E, said Sierra Pacific does not plan=
=20
to resume transmitting electricity to the utility.
?????"From our point of view we have terminated those contracts," said Bob=
=20
Ellery, Sierra Pacific's director of energy resources.
?????Henneberry said he doubts that Edison plans to pay EF Oxnard because t=

?????An Edison spokesman said his company sent payments totaling $206 milli=

ew=20
power plants in Southern California and asked the Gas Co. to develop a new=
=20
pricing system.
?????But the issue was reassigned earlier this year to a new administrative=
=20
law judge as the commission reshuffled its load to handle more pressing=20
energy emergencies. That judge does not expect a final ruling any time soon=
.
?????"The case is in limbo," said Carol Brown, the judge, who must sift=20
through years of transcripts before writing a draft decision. She predicted=
=20
that "we might all be old and gray" by the time a final vote is taken by th=
e=20
full commission.
?????Enacted in 1995, the so-called Residual Load Service tariff can levy=
=20
massive penalties against Gas Co. customers who choose an alternate=20
distributor but later have to return to the company's network.
?????If service on a competing pipeline is interrupted, a power plant that=
=20
had to switch back to the Gas Co. for a day of deliveries could be charged=
=20
what it would cost to reserve that capacity for an entire year.
?????For many power plants, the risk of leaving the Gas. Co. with the tarif=
f=20
in place is simply too high.
?????"If there's any risk that that might happen, there's no way you're goi=
ng=20
to sign up for another pipeline, because you'd end up paying twice for=20
natural gas service," said Tom Beach, a former PUC staffer and a consultant=
=20
for Crossborder Energy who testified against the tariff. "It just shows how=
=20
punitive this rate is and how it discourages people from bringing in new=20
pipelines and trying to compete with SoCal Gas."
?????Critics charge that the tariff is so punitive that not a single power=
=20
supplier has left Southern California Gas.
?????The tariff was approved with ratepayers in mind--and actually was=20
heavily endorsed by consumer activists. Without it, they said, Southern=20
California Gas could pass on any loss in business from competing pipelines =
to=20
its residential and other core customers.
?????Still, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., California's other top gas utility,=
=20
has never requested such a tariff to protect its Northern California=20
territory from competitors.
?????But as PG&E itself points out, the market is more competitive in=20
Southern California, where four of the five major interstate pipelines=20
serving California cross the state border.
?????"We never felt we needed it," said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman.=
=20
"There's not the same competitive situation up here as there is down there.=
"
?????The Gas Co. says the tariff is necessary to prevent power plants from=
=20
shopping around for the best pipeline deal and then using the company's lin=
es=20
as a backup system during emergencies. The company said that could disrupt=
=20
service to its regular customers.
?????"It's not really economical to have our facilities standing by--not=20
being used--and not being paid for it," said Steve Rahon, a Gas Co.=20
regulatory manager. "They want our facilities to be ready in case they can'=
t=20
receive all of their load from the Questar pipeline. We want this tariff to=
=20
be able to charge a fair price for that."
?????Furthermore, the utility says, its customers need to be protected from=
=20
higher rates and the utility needs to be able to compete on a level playing=
=20
field with interstate pipelines that play by different pricing and delivery=
=20
rules.
?????The pipeline companies agree that bypass customers should pay a price=
=20
for swinging back and forth between providers. But they argue that the=20
existing tariff is so high it is preventing fair competition. As proof of=
=20
that, they say, energy companies have resisted siting power plants in the G=
as=20
Co.'s territory. What's more, the tariff has never been triggered.
?????"It's important to note that no one has ever taken service under this=
=20
rate because it's such a risk," Beach said.
?????During a rate proceeding last year, the PUC found that "gas supply=20
competition is critical to the economic survival of both existing and new=
=20
electric generators" and agreed that the tariff may be discouraging the=20
siting of new power plants in the Los Angeles Basin.
?????The commission ordered Southern California Gas to come up with a new=
=20
pricing system that must "not be the equivalent" of the old one. The Gas Co=
.=20
has proposed two alternative rate structures, both of which do not impress=
=20
the pipeline companies.
?????It will be up to Brown, the administrative law judge, to choose betwee=
n=20
the Gas Co.'s proposals and those suggested by opposing parties. She could=
=20
also suggest yet another rate, or repeal the existing tariff altogether.
?????"I need to write a decision. And that's kind of a daunting project,"=
=20
said Brown, who inherited the case in January.
?????"I really can't give you a projection," she said. "It's one of those=

things that if the commission decides it's incredibly important and needs i=

Experts Doubtful About Rush to Build Small Power Plants
Energy: State wants =01,peaker=01, units to fill 40% of summer gap. But var=

factors make that seem unlikely.
By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer
?????Gov. Gray Davis has mobilized state government and invited developers =

avert blackouts this summer.
?????But, as California races against time, industry experts say the=20
logistics and uncertainties of power plant construction make it doubtful th=

state will have as much peaker electricity as it is seeking:
?????Generating turbines--which resemble giant jet engines--are in tight=20
supply. Design, engineering, construction and testing take several months.=
=20
And community opposition is sometimes a concern because the plants can be=

?????Without knowing how much people will conserve, state officials estimat=

the summer energy shortage at about 5,000 megawatts--enough to serve 3.7=20

providing 50 to 100 megawatts each, to make up about 40% of that shortfall.
?????But records and interviews with energy experts, state officials and=20
potential plant developers show that:
?????* A contracting program the state hopes will bring in about 1,100=20

?????* An effort begun last year to issue plant permits within four months=

led to approval of only one 50-megawatt plant at San Francisco Internationa=

?????The California Energy Commission approved two projects, and five more=

are being reviewed, for a total of about 500 megawatts. State officials=20
concede that not all the power will be available the entire summer because=
=20
developers have until Sept. 30--after summer ends--to get plants online.
?????During a recent workshop to promote the construction of peaker plants,=
=20
Roger Johnson of the energy commission said the panel is tracking an=20

expected to file in April.
?????=01+It is possible we can meet the goal,=01+ he said, adding that Sout=

California Edison has 20 requests for new power plant hookups totaling an=

?????Can those proposed Southern California plants, most of them designed t=

developers. =01+Chances are slim.=01+

?????=01,People Can=01,t Seem to Move=01,

?????After two weeks on the California market, the=20

?????To encourage plant development, the state has compressed the permit=20

?????=01+Nobody has ever moved this rapidly, still being mindful of all=20
environmental standards, to put power online,=01+ Davis told The Times=01,=
=20
editorial board Friday.
?????The energy commission has also developed a list of potential peaker=20
plant sites that have a minimum of two acres and proximity to gas and=20
electricity infrastructure.
?????The commission identified the San Francisco Bay Area, parts of the=20
Central Valley and San Diego as the regions most in need of peaking power=
=20
plants, but said the Los Angeles region could also benefit.
?????Thirty-two sites with a potential for producing 1,700 to 3,400 megawat=
ts=20
of peaking power passed the initial screening for suitability, according to=
 a=20
Feb. 21 report. They ranged from a soap factory in Sacramento County and a=

paper mill in Ontario to the former Ft. Ord army base near Monterey and the=
=20
Pitchess Honor Ranch in Los Angeles County.
?????The only project approved under the four-month permitting program=20

 said=20
Vijay Patel of the department. =01+They are all in play.=01+
?????The new=20

said energy commission spokesman Rob Schlichting. =01+Maybe we should call =

Stage 3 power plants.=01+
?????When The Times contacted owners of about 20 plant=20
sites on the state list, few said they had deals or solid proposals for=20
construction. Many were fielding calls from owners of turbines and potentia=

Davis Says All Power Costs to Be Recovered

?????But he was nevertheless upbeat about the financial package he has=20

y=20
salty in his denunciations of those he considers responsible for the power=
=20
shortages and price surges that have wreaked havoc in the state=01,s newly=

deregulated electricity market.
?????Davis described the out-of-state power generators and marketers who ha=

raised the price of electricity by hundreds of percentage points as =01+the=
=20
biggest snakes on the planet Earth.=01+
?????He questioned what his predecessors=20

electricity demand. But he saved most of his vituperation for the federal=
=20
agency that has refused the state=01,s entreaties to place a cap on wholesa=

?????=01+If you=01,re looking for a culprit, I=01,ll give you a culprit,=01=

=01+The culprit is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=01+ As far bac=

keep blackouts to a minimum this summer.

?????Blaming Others for the Crisis
?????Davis expressed frustration at the hand he has been dealt, repeatedly=
=20
insisting that he had inherited the power problems, not created them.
?????At the time that deregulation was being considered by the Legislature =

1996, Davis was state controller. =01+I basically wasn=01,t asked to take a=
=20
position and I didn=01,t take a position,=01+ he said. =01+I didn=01,t give=
 it much=20
thought.=01+
?????Since January, the state has been forced to spend $5.2 billion=20
buying power that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric hav=
e=20
been unable to afford.
?????A Davis-sponsored plan approved by the Legislature calls for the state=
=20
to float bonds to repay the state and help finance the purchases. The bonds=
,=20
in turn, would be repaid by utility ratepayers through their monthly bills.
?????The plan was based on the premise that the state would be able to=20
stabilize, and eventually lower, the price of electricity by entering into=
=20
long-term contracts with power suppliers. Those lower prices have yet to=20
materialize.
?????On average, California has been burning through $50 million a day on=
=20
electricity--and that number will soon go up to about $57 million,=20
administration officials say, because of a federal regulatory decision last=
=20
week. That decision requires the state to buy power on behalf of cash-poor=
=20
utilities, regardless of price.
?????Despite the mind-numbing figures, Davis and his financial advisors=20
insisted Friday that they have created a plan that will make the utilities=
=20
self-supporting--and take taxpayers off the hook--by early 2003. Here=01,s =
how:
?????* A record $12.4 billion in bonds scheduled to be issued in June would=
=20
not only repay the budget, but would cover future state purchases of=20
electricity and help the utilities repay their debts. ?????* New, higher=20
electricity rates would give California about $6 billion this year. That=20
money, along with the portion of the bond money left over after repayment o=
f=20
the state=01,s debts, would be used to finance future state power purchases=
.
?????The rationale behind those estimates is nearly impossible to scrutiniz=
e,=20
because Davis=01, cadre of Wall Street advisors and utility experts has ref=
used=20
to make public the contract information on which the figures are based.
?????They have even kept the information from state Treasurer Phil=20
Angelides--the elected official charged with implementing the bond deal tha=
t=20
is the linchpin of the recovery plan.
?????In recent weeks, Angelides has made a series of public statements=20
raising questions about the plan.
?????At the current rate that California is spending money on electricity,=
=20
Angelides estimated, the bond issue will run out this fall--not, as Davis=
=20
said, in 2002.
?????Davis and his advisors said Friday that Angelides did not understand t=

more information with Angelides in coming weeks as the bond deal grew neare=

they said. The state will also be required to disclose some information whe=

plan,=01+ adding that it had been given the =01+Good Housekeeping Seal of A=
pproval=01+=20
by major Wall Street investment firms.
?????Davis complained that the energy crisis has diverted his attention fro=

Passing Along the Cost=20
Many Bay Area businesses resort to surcharges to survive=20

Just outside the double doors of the Englander Sports Pub & Restaurant in S=
an=20
Leandro is a hand-written sign: "There will be a 5% PG&E surcharge added to=
=20
all food served."=20
It's more than just a sign of the times in these days of energy crisis in=
=20
California.=20
As gas and electricity bills skyrocket, many businesses around the Bay Area=
=20
are resorting to adding energy surcharges to stay afloat. Hotels around the=
=20
state already have started asking customers to pay more. Now, even everyday=
=20
consumptions such as dining out and working out at the gym will cost more.=
=20
"It was fun to do business. You go home, sleep at night time, get up the ne=
xt=20
day and say, 'Hey, we're gonna do it all over again,' " said Englander owne=
r=20
Jot Mangat, 46. "But now, you go home and you're wondering how much my PG&E=
=20
bill is going to be. Where is this money going to come from?"=20
Last year, his power bill was around $3,400 a month. But in February, it=20
nearly doubled to $6,000, and that's even before the Public Utilities=20
Commission decided to raise rates as much as 40 percent this year.=20
Mangat thinks that by this summer, his power bills may eclipse his monthly=
=20
rent, which is $8,000 for his downtown San Leandro establishment.=20
"This is one of the nicest restaurants in San Leandro," he said. "San Leand=
ro=20
is proud of this place, but PG&E can put us out of business."=20
Mark Cavalli, 34, and Donna Clark, 35, both of Oakland, said they had been=
=20
caught off guard when they noticed the $1 energy surcharge added to their=
=20
dinner bill on Friday at the Englander.=20
"I felt I understood it, especially with all those TVs running," Clark said=
.=20
"But I didn't like the place enough to come back here again and pay the=20
surcharge. If I liked it more, maybe I wouldn't mind paying extra."=20
SLIM MARGINS, HIGH PRICES
Escalating power costs are particularly hard on restaurants because their=
=20
profit margin is already slim, averaging 2 to 7 percent, said John Dunlap,=
=20
president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, a lobbying grou=
p=20
in Sacramento.=20
"If you're a restaurateur on the brink . . . or if you're not having a good=
=20
year, this could push you over the edge," Dunlap said. "You're going to see=
=20
hundreds of restaurants closing statewide because of this. . . . I can assu=
re=20
you, there will be a body count."=20
And that's exactly what Martha Pena, manager at Fentons Creamery & Restaura=
nt=20
in Oakland, wants to avoid.=20
The popular ice cream parlor started adding energy surcharges to customers'=
=20
bills two months ago: 25 cents per $10 for takeouts and 30 cents per $10 fo=
r=20
dining in.=20
They also posted a sign near the front door to alert customers.=20
"Sometimes people ask us why we're doing this, but after we give them the=
=20
explanation, they say they understand," Pena said.=20
Fentons' ice cream was still as sweet Saturday, even with the 30-cent bump =
in=20
their lunch bill, said John and Theresa Strickland of Pleasanton.=20
"Actually we didn't even notice," John Strickland said, adding that he was=
=20
willing to pay the little bit extra if it meant keeping a place like Fenton=
s=20
in business.=20
BUSINESS THREAT
"The energy crisis is going to put smaller places out of business unless th=
ey=20
add surcharges," Theresa Strickland said. "The little fish can't compete wi=
th=20
the big sharks."=20
Fentons' gas bill more than doubled from $400 to $1,000 a month since last=
=20
year, while the electricity bill has stayed relatively stable at around $30=
0.=20
But that was during the winter season when the business doesn't have to bla=
st=20
its air conditioning. The power bill picture will likely look drastically=
=20
different when the weather warms up this spring and summer, said Fentons=20
bookkeeper Dan Tonelli.=20
Bars and restaurants are not the only businesses to feel the pinch.=20
At the Albany Sauna & Hot Tubs, owner Tim Adam has already raised prices=20
twice since December.=20
"It's really upsetting that we're passing this on (to our customers)," he=
=20
said. "People who come in here are just ordinary people who care about thei=
r=20
health. . . . People are saying they're paying more everywhere. . . . What=
=20
we're frustrated about is that (our) cost of living is going up."=20
For half-hour sessions, Adam raised the price from $9 to $10 last December,=
=20
and then added another $1 starting April 6.=20
The increases aren't arbitrary. Adam carefully calculated the figures to ma=
ke=20
sure the extra revenues just cover his PG&E bill, which has tripled.=20
Adam already has tried to cut down by installing energy efficient light=20
bulbs, shutting down unneeded lights and asking customers to use only one=
=20
towel.=20
But the bottom line is that his business needs energy to heat water for hot=
=20
tubs, rocks for the dry sauna, and to run washers and dryers for towels.=20
YMCA ADDS $1 SURCHARGE
Across the Bay, the YMCA of San Francisco also has decided to add energy=20
surcharges: $1 per month across the board for everyone.=20
After six months, the YMCA will reconsider whether to stop, continue or=20
increase the surcharges, spokeswoman Jane Holt said.=20
At the Central YMCA in the Tenderloin, the gas bill has nearly tripled to=
=20
$23,000 as administrators scramble for ways to save energy, she said.=20
"We've put in fluorescent lights. . . . All the boilers and other systems a=
re=20
working as efficiently as possible . . . insulated the pipes, added digital=
=20
timers for lights," Holt said.=20
But that hasn't put a dent in the monthly bill.=20
And despite the extra fees that will be collected from the Central YMCA's 3=
,=20
500 members, that will not cover increases in the PG&E bills, forcing the=
=20
group to use reserve funds, Holt said.=20
Jerry Englebardt, a runner and Y member from New York who visits San=20
Francisco four months a year, said he noticed the increase but wasn't=20
bothered because "the facilities here are so good."=20
"In New York," Englebardt said, "they think people in California are going=
=20
around with candles. It's being played up as if California is going out of=
=20
business. But it's not true."=20
HEALTH CLUBS RAISE FEES
Health clubs that feature heated pools, with their high energy costs, are=
=20
really feeling the pinch.=20
Linda Hansen, general manager of Walnut Creek Sports & Fitness Club, said=
=20
adding a $3.50 per month energy surcharge to her members' fees was difficul=
t=20
because they had just raised their rates by 7 percent at the end of last=20
year.=20
"We have one heated pool, and we keep it at 83 degrees," Hansen said. "When=
=20
we had the cold spell, that was killing us. . . . But what else can we do?"=
=20
"Inside, I'm screaming . . ." Hansen said. "I'm angry, really angry that th=

Rows of parabolic mirrors focus the sun's rays into a high-energy beam that=

"This technology has been around for 15 years," said Bob Cable, manager of=

KJC Operating Co., which runs five of the solar-thermal units for investors=
=20
that include East Coast utilities and insurance firms. "It's very reliable.=

And with today's high fuel prices, we're a bargain.=20
"There's really nothing like us in the world," Cable said. And for renewabl=
e=20
energy advocates, that's the problem.=20
Solar-thermal is just one of several renewable forms of energy that have=20
languished for years. No new plants have been built in a decade, mainly=20
because power produced using low-cost fossil fuels made alternative energy=
=20
look pricey.=20
But now that the price of natural gas has shot up, solar, wind and geotherm=
al=20
are more attractive to big energy suppliers.=20
"There's a lot of consolidation in the field now. Big players are coming in=

and setting up divisions for solar and wind energy," said Dave Renee, a=20
research analyst for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden,=20
Colo.,=20
a division of the U.S. Department of Energy.=20
Even before the power crisis, oil and gas companies were increasing their=

Enron, the Texas supplier of natural gas, has bought Zond, a major wind pow=
er=20
company. The oil companies have also invested in hydrogen fuel cell=20
technology, which may soon be used to power cars, homes, offices and=20
factories.=20
"We think the new technologies are going to get better, and prices will com=

down," said George Douglas, a spokesman for the National Renewable Energy=

Laboratory. "And we think the price of conventional power plants, whatever=
=20
fuel they're using, is going to come up."=20
12 PERCENT RENEWABLE POWER=20
Today, only 12 percent of California's power comes from renewables, but=20
advocates envision a future electrical grid with a diverse mix of=20
nonpolluting energy sources, large and small.=20
"California should be much more aggressive in pursuing the renewable energy=

company that has developed new solar technology being used in power plants =
in=20
Australia and Arizona. "We are leaving the state too vulnerable if we are t=
oo=20
dependent on natural gas."=20
Gov. Gray Davis wants to rush 5,000 megawatts of capacity into service by=

July through construction of large and small power plants. Renewable energy=

"The investments we make this year and next year will stay with us for the=

with a fossil fuel economy."=20
Sixteen percent of the new 5,000 megawatts will come from renewables --=20
mainly from wind power, but also from biomass, energy created from organic=
=20

The California Energy Commission's $202 million subsidy program for renewab=
le=20
plants offers financing incentives of as much as 1.5 cents per kilowatt hou=
r,=20
or up to one quarter of cost, to help these systems compete.=20
ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
Environmentalists want more economic incentives for renewables, and also=20
taxes on fossil fuel power plants to offset the pollution they cause.=20
Since the 1970s, most government subsidies for renewable technologies have=
=20
gone to solar power, although it accounts for less than 1 percent of the=20
state's electricity -- less than geothermal (5 percent), wind (2 percent),=
=20
small hydro plants (3 percent) and biomass (2 percent).=20
Solar has proved costly to develop, but appears to be on the verge of payin=

"In the last 20 years the cost of producing electricity from solar cells ha=
s=20
dropped tenfold," Douglas said. "We can expect it to drop at a similar rate=

 Gov. Gray Davis may have a hard time persuading skeptical ?lawmakers to ap=
prove the deal he reached last week to rescue Southern ?California Edison. =
?It's a sell job with the highest stakes. Without legislative approval, the=
 ?deal collapses, and Edison probably joins Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in=
 ?bankruptcy court. ?"I don't feel there is a gun to my head to pass this d=
eal with Edison. This ?is going to be pounded like a cheap steak," said Sen=
. Don Perata, D-Oakland. ?"It's the governor who is going to have to come i=
n and sell it to us," Perata ?said. "I don't intend to deal with intermedia=
ries." ?That's the central tension as lawmakers return today from a one-wee=
k spring ?break. ?There is also a mountain of bills on other issues that ha=
ve languished for ?months while the Legislature wrestled with the state's e=
nergy mess. ?But it is Davis' $2.7 billion dollar deal -- and its bankrolli=
ng of a hefty ?chunk of Edison's financial recovery with ratepayer dollars =
-- that could ?elevate some Democrats' private grumblings about the governo=
r into open ?rebellion. ?WHOLESALE APPROVAL SOUGHT?Magnifying that legislat=
ive grumpiness, Davis wants lawmakers to rubber- ?stamp his deal. ?"The gov=
ernor would prefer if they took the negotiation lock, stock and ?barrel but=
 they have the right to amend it as needed," said Steve Maviglio, ?Davis' p=
ress secretary. "We don't want them to, but they can." ?In an April 10 fili=
ng with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Edison ?suggests that if th=
e Legislature changes the deal or balks at voting for it, ?all bets are off=
. ?"They can have it that way, as long as they're comfortable with the answ=
er ?not being yes," said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwom=
an of ?the upper house's energy committee. "Last time I checked, the Senate=
 don't ?cotton much to ultimatums." ?Bowen, who will lead the Senate's revi=
ew of the deal, opposes it. ?"I don't understand why this is a good deal fo=
r ratepayers. It looks like a ?deal for Edison shareholders and the credito=
rs," she said. "And I don't ?understand what the rush is, because it does n=
othing to help us this summer." ?UTILITY CAN WALK AWAY?The deal itself says=
 that if legislative approval is not given by Aug. 15, ?Edison can walk awa=
y. ?Maviglio said Davis plans to be in Sacramento this week to meet with ?l=
awmakers and pitch his deal. But he did not know when Davis would present ?=
proposed legislation. ?Frustrated by the governor's past refusal to present=
 a comprehensive package ?of bills to address the energy crisis, lawmakers =
have said they won't do ?anything about the Edison deal until Davis gives t=
hem a bill to introduce. ?There are already signs that Davis' proposal is a=
nything but a legislative ?slam dunk. ?Senate President Pro Tem John Burton=
, D-San Francisco, said last week that ?the plan needs to be subjected to "=
extensive" legislative hearings by the ?Senate energy and appropriations co=
mmittees and possibly the judiciary ?committees. ?Extensive hearings is oft=
en legislative code for death by 1,000 cuts. ?Lawmakers have also questione=
d the cost of buying Edison's transmission ?lines. More lawmakers are also =
wondering what benefit the state gets from ?owning a portion of the grid in=
stead of all of it. ?Before PG&E's bankruptcy, much of the Legislature's an=
d governor's actions ?were driven by a desire to prevent bankruptcies for f=
ear it would cut ?consumers off from power. ?But more than a week after PG&=
E filed for bankruptcy, the lights are still on ?and, increasingly, lawmake=
rs are saying that perhaps a bankruptcy court is a ?better venue than the p=
olitical process to sort out the problems of PG&E and ?Edison. ?"There is a=
 re-evaluation happening," said Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D- ?Davis. ?NO=
T A REGIONAL PRIORITY?Thomson also said bailing out Edison is not a top-of-=
the-list priority for ?Northern California lawmakers. ?"What are those Sout=
hern California power lines going to connect up to? How's ?this deal going =
to benefit electricity in the north?" Thomson said. "You can ?buy a lot of =
health care, school books and traffic relief for $2.7 billion. " ?The state=
 has already spent about $5.2 billion to buy electricity on behalf ?of Cali=
fornia's two largest investor-owned utilities. ?Democrats also can vote aga=
inst the Edison deal with the blessing of consumer ?groups that brand Davis=
' deal a gargantuan giveaway to Edison, with the ?bailout coming mainly at =
the expense of ratepayers. ?"It's dead on arrival. It's a complete capitula=
tion to Edison that will cost ?ratepayers billions of dollars," said Harvey=
 Rosenfield, head of the ?Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ?"If=
 the governor says the Legislature stopped me from forcing you, the ?ratepa=
yer, to bail out Edison I don't think legislators have much to fear ?from t=
hat criticism," Rosenfield said. ?Besides the price, there are many other a=
spects of the deal to which ?Democrats may object. According to an analysis=
 by legislative staff members: ?"It will take a while to elevate the comfor=
t level," said Assemblyman Herb ?Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ?E-mail Greg Lucas =

8312.DTL&type=3Dnews ?Washington -- The new national energy policy that Pre=
sident Bush will roll ?out in a few weeks is intended as a bold call to add=
ress a crisis made vivid ?by California's blackouts. ?The hope has been tha=
t California's woes -- and soaring energy prices ?nationwide -- have whette=

wer, more coal and more drilling for oil and gas. ?It's not turning out tha=
t way. ?Instead, the administration finds itself under attack as rabidly an=
ti- ?environment and is losing GOP support on Capitol Hill for its proposal=
 to ?open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. ?"Their v=
ision for the American West begins in the oil field and ends at the ?gas pu=
mp," said Jay Watson, regional director of the Wilderness Society. ?And as =
summer threatens to darken California -- with shortages spilling ?across th=
e Northwest -- the administration is fending off calls for ?electricity pri=
ce controls fueled by a coordinated Democratic drive to blame ?Bush for the=
 blackouts. ?Even before taking office, the Bush camp had feared that Calif=
ornia's ?electricity mess could become a political and economic sinkhole. S=
o far, it ?has. ?While Bush, a Texas oil veteran, campaigned on reversing t=
he Clinton ?administration's energy "neglect," California's crisis made ene=
rgy an ?unwelcome early priority, consuming vast quantities of White House =
attention ?during Bush's critical first months in office. ?Bush tapped Vice=
 President Dick Cheney, another oil veteran, to head a ?Cabinet-level task =
force to plot out a plan. While California posed risks, ?the administration=
 calculated that the state could also serve as a poster ?child for what hap=
pens when energy needs are ignored. ?But so far, a proposal to drill in the=
 Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has ?become the poster child. ?As the plan=
's outlines take shape, there is more that will send ?environmentalists to =
the barricades: more use of coal, more nuclear power, ?more drilling for oi=
l and gas on public lands, more power lines and ?pipelines, and easier lice=
nsing of hydroelectric dams. ?"We're looking at all different approaches to=
 it and want to present a ?balanced approach," Interior Secretary Gale Nort=
on said Thursday. ?DEFENDING A POSITION?Top Bush officials are playing defe=
nse, listing ways they are helping ?California and explaining why their str=
ategy does not include price controls. ?Yet as California's crisis spreads =
across the West, so does the call for ?price controls, even as support for =
more production fails to build. ?"Unfortunately the national focus . . . ha=
s been diverted away from the ?challenge of inadequate supply to price cont=
rols," said Energy Secretary ?Spencer Abraham recently. ?Meanwhile, high en=
ergy prices are undermining the economy. Indeed, the reason ?the White Hous=
e so resists price caps is its conviction that caps would make ?the shortag=
es -- and the economic damage -- worse. ?Bush's answer is to boost supply. =
But the combination makes for dangerous ?politics: an energy policy that is=
 portrayed as both anti-environment and ?anti- California. ?Fred C. Smith, =
head of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of many ?conservative pol=
icy groups closely allied with the administration, thinks the ?public will =
come Bush's way. ?"When they're faced with a choice between no air conditio=
ning and no lights ?and no jobs, or drilling in areas they have never been =
to . . . they're going ?to be crying for getting energy out there," he said=
. ?GAS-RICH FORMATION?Although drilling in the Arctic Refuge has drawn the =
most heat -- and is ?already losing Republican votes in the Senate -- Bush =
may focus more on the ?Overthrust Belt, a geological formation in the Rocki=
es considered potentially ?rich in natural gas. ?President Bill Clinton blo=
cked large portions of the area to drilling when he ?put roadless designati=
ons on 58 million acres during his last days in office. ?A Bush reversal of=
 Clinton's move is "virtually guaranteed," said Robert ?Nelson, a Universit=
y of Maryland professor close to the administration. "The ?Overthrust Belt =
is one of the major prospective gas areas in the country." ?Studies estimat=
e it might hold 137 trillion cubic feet of gas, enough to meet ?all current=
 U.S. needs for nearly seven years. But 40 percent of that is on ?federal l=
and that is closed to drilling. ?A draft Interior Department report indicat=
es a broad-ranging review of all ?such land policies. The administration mi=
ght even look at Clinton's new ?national monuments designations, such as th=
e Carrizo Plain between ?Bakersfield and Santa Maria that is thought to hav=
e gas potential. ?The administration says 90 new power plants must be built=
 each year to keep ?up with demand, and it sees nuclear power, which now pr=
ovides 20 percent of ?the nation's electricity, as an alternative to over-r=
eliance on the natural- ?gas generators. ?Cheney also advocates nuclear pow=
er -- which does not produce the carbon ?dioxide emissions many scientists =
believe cause global warming -- as a ?response to the barrage of criticism =
for the administration's exit from the ?Kyoto Protocol, which calls for lar=
ge cuts in carbon dioxide emissions. ?The United States has not built a nuc=
lear plant since the Three Mile Island ?accident a generation ago. But prop=
onents contend that new plants are ?smaller, safer and cheaper and can be b=
uilt in months, not years, although ?Cheney concedes that the problem of wa=
ste disposal is unsolved. ?Although many environmentalists cut their teeth =
on the anti-nuclear movement, ?up to now they have not actively opposed nuc=
lear power plant relicensing. ?Whether they will accept new construction is=
 another matter. ?At the same time, the administration is planning a big pu=
sh for coal -- which ?does produce large amounts of carbon dioxide and othe=
r emissions. Coal- fired ?generators, which produce 52 percent of the natio=
n's electricity, are ?increasingly being supplanted by cleaner natural gas =
plants. Bush's budget ?calls for a new $150 billion "clean coal power initi=
ative," and Abraham ?emphasized that the United States has a 250-year suppl=
y of coal at current ?use levels. ?CONSERVATION LACKING?But even environmen=
tal groups that resisted criticizing Bush when he took ?office now blast hi=
m for rejecting conservation as an alternative. ?"Leading people to believe=
 that America can drill its way out of its energy ?dependence is just silly=
," said Philip Kavits, spokesman for the National ?Wildlife Federation. ?Ly=
nn Scarlett, president of the libertarian Reason Foundation and nominated ?=
by Bush to a top Interior Department post, maintains that U.S. environmenta=
l ?standards and technology argue for meeting more energy needs here. ?"If =
anyone in the world is going to do it in an environmentally sensitive ?way,=
 it's going to be the United States," she said. "Not Russia, not Iraq, ?not=
 China." ?Scarlett also said the administration "has every intention" of us=
ing ?alternative fuels, especially biomass. ?Bush and his top officials hav=
e warned from the outset that the new energy ?policy will offer few direct =
remedies for California. ?"Those who wish for overnight solutions I think a=
re not going to find us able ?to solve every problem in a matter of days," =
Abraham said. ?Indeed, Bush himself has said that California's electricity =
meltdown is a ?problem that California has to fix, and that his energy poli=
cy will be aimed ?more broadly. ?When the policy emerges, however, it may o=
nly heap fuel on the fight with ?environmentalists, and face criticism for =
doing little to aid California. ?E-mail Carolyn Lochhead at clochhead@sfchr=

ut talks with Gov. Gray Davis fell apart after the utility ?demanded unprec=
edented freedom from regulatory oversight and the ability to ?pass along hu=
ge rate increases to consumers, The Chronicle has learned. ?Pacific Gas and=
 Electric Co. claimed that its decision this month to file for ?bankruptcy =
protection in San Francisco resulted from the governor's ?unwillingness to =
negotiate a fair deal. ?But a confidential proposal submitted by PG&E durin=
g the talks shows that the ?utility was the more ambitious and stubborn neg=
otiator and that the deal ?sought by the company was doomed to fail from th=
e outset. ?"It's like the Japanese insisting that we surrender Hawaii after=
 we beat them ?in World War II," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Founda=
tion for Taxpayer ?and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ?He described PG&E'=
s demands as "breathtaking in their level of self- ?delusion." ?A copy of t=
he eight-page, single-spaced proposal was obtained by The ?Chronicle. ?"PG&=
E was arrogant and defiant, and acted like we owed them something," said ?S=
teve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. "That's not how you enter into=
 ?a negotiation." ?UTILITY MAKES DEMANDS?Among the utility's demands: ?-- P=
G&E insisted that it be cleared of any wrongdoing when it transferred ?mill=
ions of dollars to its parent company. ?-- In a sale of its power grid to t=
he state, PG&E still wanted to retain ?possession of valuable assets, inclu=
ding the right to profit from any ?telecommunications lines or antennas lin=
ked to the system. ?-- PG&E required that it be given first right of refusa=
l if the state ever ?chose to sell off the power lines, allowing the utilit=
y to buy back the ?system without competitive offers. ?"It is ludicrous to =
suggest that this document caused the negotiations to ?break down," said Ro=
n Low, a PG&E spokesman. "There were negotiations that ?occurred later and =
other documents that followed." ?The company's proposal is dated Feb. 28. S=
ources familiar with the ?negotiations said PG&E did not significantly depa=
rt from its initial offer ?during follow-up meetings. ?Robert Glynn, chairm=
an of the utility's parent company, PG&E Corp., said that ?when the bankrup=
tcy filing was made April 6, no substantive talks had been ?held for at lea=
st three weeks. ?This would have made PG&E's proposal only about two weeks =
old when the ?negotiations unraveled. ?AT AN IMPASSE?Sources said the utili=
ty refused to budge during that interval and that the ?impasse centered pri=
marily on PG&E's insistence that it be subject to less ?oversight by the Ca=
lifornia Public Utilities Commission. ?"They took a position on regulatory =
matters that was out of touch with ?reality," said Maviglio, the governor's=
 spokesman. ?Indeed, the single most striking aspect of PG&E's proposal is =
its repeated ?references to a reduction in the state PUC's regulatory autho=
rity. ?For example, the utility argues that it is entitled to recoup from c=
onsumers ?about $9 billion in costs accrued because of runaway wholesale po=
wer prices. ?The proposal says this money "will be fully recovered in retai=
l rates without ?further CPUC review for prudence or any other purpose." ?P=
G&E also insisted that virtually all official restrictions on its activitie=
s ?based on the 1996 legislation that deregulated California's electricity =
?market be overturned. ?"The CPUC will terminate or modify the scope of exi=
sting commission ?proceedings and will not initiate new proceedings related=
 to implementation ?of (the legislation) or issues pertaining to the reason=
ableness and recovery ?of costs," the proposal stipulates. ?This would incl=
ude a current investigation by the state PUC into whether PG&E ?violated st=
ate law by transferring millions of dollars from the utility to ?its parent=
 company before filing for bankruptcy. ?PG&E's proposal maintains that the =
state "will waive and release all claims ?arising out of the dispute," incl=
uding the money transfer and a restructuring ?of the parent company that pr=
otected it from the utility's financial woes. ?Furthermore, it instructs th=
at the state PUC "will issue an order finding ?that PG&E and PG&E Corp. hav=
e fully complied with state laws and CPUC orders ?. . . and that their cond=
uct and transactions did not contravene public ?policy." ?"It's Bob Glynn t=
hinking he's god of the universe," said Nettie Hoge, ?executive director Th=
e Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "PG&E doesn't ?think they're beh=
olden to state law. They think they're a law unto ?themselves." ?Shawn Coop=
er, a spokesman for PG&E's parent company, declined to discuss the ?content=
s of the proposal. "That document is confidential," he said. ?THE EDISON DE=
AL?No language concerning compliance with state laws was included in the ac=
cord ?reached last week between the governor and Southern California Edison=
. ?That agreement, which still requires final approval from lawmakers, woul=
d ?restore the utility to creditworthiness in return for acquisition of its=
 ?power lines and other concessions. ?Sources said the deal reached with Ed=
ison is "very close" to terms offered by ?the state to PG&E. ?Yet, while PG=
&E's proposal seeks to diminish the regulatory role of the PUC, ?the Edison=
 accord bends over backward to stress the PUC's authority over the ?utility=
. ?"It is expressly understood that there is no intention to change (Edison=
) ?continuing to be a public utility that is subject to the jurisdiction of=
 the ?California Public Utilities Commission," it states on the first page.=
 ?Maviglio said he did not sit in on the talks with either utility, but he =
?learned from negotiators that both PG&E and Edison had misgivings about th=
e ?PUC's role as a consumer watchdog. ?"Edison had some mistrust of the PUC=
, but they understood that they had to ?live with the regulators," he said.=
 ?PG&E, on the other hand, harbored a deeper grudge, which Maviglio said wa=
s ?"very emotional" for the utility. He speculated that PG&E desired retrib=
ution ?for a past regulatory setback. ?"Perhaps we misjudged their primary =
concern," he said. "It wasn't resolving ?their credit issue. It was extract=
ing vengeance on the PUC." ?TALKS GROUND TO HALT?Maviglio said the talks qu=
ickly hit a brick wall after PG&E submitted its ?deal terms. While state ne=
gotiators were prepared to discuss many of the ?points, he said, they could=
 not yield on matters of regulatory oversight. ?"We were willing to negotia=
te the terms of the deal but not constitutional ?controls," Maviglio said. =
"They were attempting not just to set the course of ?the future but also to=
 right the wrongs of the past." ?The first sign of trouble emerged when PG&=
E officials told The Chronicle in ?late March that it appeared the negotiat=
ions had collapsed. The governor's ?office, perhaps optimistically, maintai=
ned that all was well. ?Around this time, however, PG&E's Glynn made the fa=
teful decision to abandon ?the talks and to instead file for bankruptcy pro=
tection. The company gave no ?indication of its move to the governor. ?Apri=
l 5 would prove to be a pivotal date in California's energy saga. ?While PG=
&E was preparing to file for bankruptcy the next morning and was ?handing o=
ut last-minute bonuses and raises to thousands of employees, Davis ?was put=
ting the final touches on a televised speech in which he would all but ?ass=
ure the utilities they would recover their costs through rate increases. ?S=
ources said the governor's negotiators called PG&E to brief the company's ?=
chief financial officer, Peter Darbee, on what Davis was about to say. ?The=
y had to pull Darbee from a meeting of PG&E's board of directors, where, ?p=
resumably, the official vote was being taken to file for Chapter 11. Darbee=
 ?was informed about the intended speech but said little in response. ?The =
next day, after making the bombshell bankruptcy announcement, PG&E's ?Glynn=
 laid blame for the collapse of bailout talks entirely on Davis. ?"We liste=
ned carefully to the (governor's) statement and the commentary that ?follow=
ed, and this decision is the result," he said. ?"The negotiations we have b=
een involved in since last November have gone ?nowhere," Glynn added. "Over=
 the last month, the kindest thing to say is ?progress has dramatically slo=
wed." ?"There was no room for negotiation," countered Maviglio. "It was the=
ir way or ?the highway." ?Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Con=
sumer Rights seldom sees eye ?to eye with the governor. But in this case, h=
e finds himself defending Davis. ?"The document absolves the governor of re=
sponsibility for PG&E's bankruptcy, ?" Rosenfield said. "It's good to know =
there are limits beyond which even ?Davis wouldn't go." ?The governor's neg=
otiators remain hopeful that a deal still can be reached ?with PG&E compara=
ble to the state's accord with Edison. ?Maviglio said PG&E has several mont=

/chronicle/archive/2001/04/15/B?U152654.DTL&type=3Dnews ?When Bernard Marsz=
alek talks about economists who say California's energy ?crisis is no big d=
eal, you can almost see the smoke rising from his ears. ?Marszalek, marketi=
ng manager for Inkworks Press, a Berkeley printer, has seen ?his company's =
cost of natural gas go up about 60 percent. Now he's facing the ?prospect o=
f a 40 percent increase in the cost of electricity, which powers ?Inkworks'=
 two presses. The potential hit: $3,600 a year, no small sum for a ?busines=
s that grosses $2 million annually. ?"Economists are people in their ivory =
towers, looking at figures," said ?Marszalek. "You talk to individual busin=
esses and they're hurting." ?One of the most striking paradoxes of the powe=
r crisis has been the vast gulf ?between the cries of pain of California's =
business community and the bland ?reassurances coming from the economics pr=
ofession. ?Businesspeople say rising costs and power disruptions have them =
on the ropes. ?"We are absolutely getting hammered," said Mike Betts, co-ow=
ner of Betts ?Spring Co., a San Leandro manufacturer of industrial springs.=
 But economists ?insist that overall damage to business in the state will b=
e relatively ?slight. ?So, what gives? Are businesspeople overreacting, or =
are economists out of ?touch with reality? ?In their own separate ways, it =
seems, they may both be right. What's going on ?here is a classic illustrat=
ion of the difference between macro and micro, the ?big picture and the ind=
ividual portrait. ?"In a large macroeconomy, labor and other costs are more=
 important than ?energy," said Mary Daly, an economist with the Federal Res=
erve Bank of San ?Francisco. "Our economy is going to be affected (by the p=
ower crisis), but it ?is not as large as it might sound when you talk with =
a manufacturer who uses ?a lot of electricity." ?Daly pointed to the Asian =
financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, which ended up ?doing little harm to the=
 U.S. economy as a whole but walloped some sectors of ?U.S. business. "Appl=
e growers in Washington were devastated" when Japan and ?other Asian countr=
ies cut back fruit imports, she noted. ?Ross DeVol, director of regional st=
udies at the Milken Institute in Santa ?Monica, estimates that the energy c=
runch will cut the state's economic growth ?rate between 0.25 and 0.4 perce=
ntage points during the next five years, a ?relatively small amount. ?The l=
imited economic damage reflects the fact that California has a higher ?prop=
ortion of white-collar businesses than most states, and they tend to be ?lo=
w energy consumers. "If you're an advertising agency, you probably won't ?c=
are much about about energy costs," DeVol said. ?In California, which produ=
ces $1.25 trillion in goods and services annually, ?businesses that are big=
 gas and electricity users -- manufacturers, dairy ?farmers, restaurants an=
d the like -- may not dominate. But there are tens of ?thousands of them, a=
nd they say it's scant comfort to think of the big ?picture when they're fi=
ghting for survival. ?"We're focused on small- and mid-size manufacturers,"=
 said Leila Mozaffari, ?vice president of the California Manufacturing Tech=
nology Center, a nonprofit ?consulting firm in Los Angeles. "What we see on=
 a micro level is that the ?energy crisis is hurting them in a bad way. The=
 smaller companies -- their ?backs are against the wall." ?Take Foote Axle =
& Forge in Los Angeles. The company, which uses large amounts ?of energy to=
 forge auto parts, has seen its monthly gas bill go from $8,000 ?to $23,000=
. That prompted owner Mike Denton to shut down his second shift ?earlier th=
is month and fire six workers. Now he's reselling axles made in ?Asia in pl=
ace of axles made in his own factory. ?"I had to let everybody (on the shif=
t) go. I couldn't afford to run it ?anymore," he said. "It's now cheaper fo=
r me to buy products this company has ?been making since 1936. If things do=
n't change, this will become a ?warehouse." ?Higher gas and electricity pri=
ces are hitting at the same time that big jumps ?in health insurance and wo=
rkers' compensation premiums are taking hold, noted ?Betts. "We've had four=
 strikes against us this year," he said. ?Contrast those stories with the c=
onclusion of a recent report from the ?University of California at Los Ange=
les. The financial effects of the ?electricity crunch "will likely have a r=
elatively small impact on the ?long-run health of the state's economy," wro=
te economist Christopher ?Thornberg, a visiting professor at the university=
's business school. ?Thornberg based his conclusion on an estimate that the=
 state government might ?have to pay as much as $30 billion for electricity=
 and infrastructure. That, ?he pointed out, is just 2.5 percent of the valu=
e of goods and services sold ?in California annually. ?When Thornberg prese=
nted his findings at UCLA earlier this month, he was ?confronted by an angr=
y business representative who accused him of having his ?head in the sand. =
?Asked about the incident, the UCLA economist conceded that the energy crun=
ch ?is hurting some businesses. ?"I understand that businessmen are going t=
hrough a tough time right now, but ?I wonder how much of that is the power =
crisis and how much is due to the fact ?that we are slipping into a recessi=
on," Thornberg said in an e-mail. "When ?sales drop, businesspeople tend to=
 point at the first available target -- ?in this case, power. They may be l=
osing sight of the forest for the tree." ?Thornberg's critics were particul=
arly galled by comments in his report that ?power blackouts will probably h=
ave scant effect on California's productivity. ?"An hour without power can =
be viewed as an extended coffee break for most ?businesses," he wrote. ?Mar=

 said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ``There were negotiations that ?occurred late=

ptcy filing April 6, PG&E Corp. Chairman ?Robert Glynn said no talks had be=
en held for three weeks. PG&E's proposal had ?been delivered about two week=
s before talks ceased. ?PG&E has said it's entitled to recoup $9 billion it=
 paid for wholesale power ?because of PUC-regulated rate caps, which kept t=
he utility from passing high ?costs onto customers. ?The proposal said this=
 money ``will be fully recovered in retail rates ?without further CPUC revi=

fs' ?At first, it sounds like an off-the-wall idea: resurface the roof of y=
our ?business with white or light-colored coating or material, and you'll s=
ave a ?fortune on air conditioning costs. ?But as the state races to launch=
 energy-saving efforts before the summer heat ?wave hits, ``Cool Roofs'' ar=
e suddenly one of the hottest conservation ideas ?around, and roofing contr=
actors are spreading the word to their clients. ?Technology companies such =
as IBM, Solectron and Apple Computer Inc. have ?already added the roofs to =
some of their buildings. Gov. Gray Davis just ?signed legislation that will=
 funnel an additional $30 million to the state's ?Cool Roofs program, which=
 gives businesses rebates for installing the ?reflective and light-colored =
roofs. ?Research has shown the roofs reflect the scorching heat of the sun =
and lower ?building temperatures. In turn, the need to crank up air conditi=
oning is ?greatly reduced. ?``While Cool Roofs do not generally cost more t=
han dark roofs, they have been ?shown to lower cooling costs by 20 percent,=
'' said California Energy ?Commissioner Art Rosenfeld. ``This simple change=
 will eventually save ?California thousands of megawatts of power.'' ?In Fl=
orida and Arizona, whitewashed roofs are common. But in California, most ?c=
ommercial and residential roofs are black or dark in color. ?When Solectron=
, the Milpitas-based electronics manufacturing services ?company, recently =
purchased a new building in Fremont, the company knew the ?176,000-square-f=
oot flat roof on Building 16 had to be replaced. ?``We thought it would be =
advantageous for us to put in a Cool Roof,'' said ?Bob Kula, a Solectron sp=
okesman. ``It's worth the investment, and we wanted ?to do it because it's =
a very important conservation move.'' ?Cooling foam??On a hot summer day, t=
he surface temperature of Building 16's roof can climb ?to 160 degrees. But=
 earlier this week, contractors were busy spraying a ?light-colored polyure=
thane foam onto the roof's surface. Doing so both drops ?the temperature of=
 the roof by more than 50 degrees and adds extra ?insulation, which enables=
 Solectron to slash its energy costs. ?The coating also extends the roof's =
life expectancy, which makes it ?cost-effective in the long run. ?Because t=
he systems usually include additional insulation, there shouldn't be ?an in=
creased heating cost during the winter, according to Cool Roofs ?advocates.=
 ?The cost of Solectron's Cool Roof is $750,000, but the company projects i=
t ?will pay for itself in five years because of the energy savings. The com=
pany ?will also receive a state rebate of about $15,000 -- or 10 cents a sq=
uare ?foot -- for the cost of the project. ?Though many commercial business=
es have begun to embrace the idea, it will be ?awhile before Cool Roofs cat=
ch on in residential neighborhoods. ?Installing a Cool Roof requires using =
the right kinds of coatings or ?single-ply materials: A homeowner can't jus=
t slap a coat of white paint on ?top of asphalt shingles. Furthermore, many=
 homeowners associations do not ?approve of white roofs for cosmetic reason=
s. ?``Because of architectural issues with residential homes, it's much mor=
e ?difficult for this to be used to the extent that it can in industrial ?b=
uildings,'' said Bob Law of BUR Services, a Pleasanton company that is ?ins=
talling Solectron's Cool Roof. ?Homeowners need not apply??So far, there is=
 no state rebate for homeowners who install Cool Roofs. ?Others hope the We=
st's energy crisis will change that. Rosenfeld has ?researched Cool Roofs f=
or decades. He worked at the Lawrence Berkeley ?National Laboratory for yea=
rs, and became interested in energy-efficient ?building design during the e=
nergy crisis of the 1970s. ?``I would love to see a residential housing dev=
eloper say they'd like to do ?the whole neighborhood with Cool Roofs,'' Ros=
enfeld said. ``We want everybody ?to do it. The Greeks and everyone else wh=
o has lived around the Mediterranean ?Sea has understood this for 2,000 yea=
rs.'' ?Besides Cool Roofs, Rosenfeld and researchers at the Heat Island Gro=
up at the ?lab are pushing the larger idea of ``Cool Communities.'' By help=
ing to reduce ?the overall temperatures in cities, Cool Roofs also cut smog=
. ?Planting shade trees on the south and west sides of a house or commercia=
l ?building also helps to cool temperatures. The sun blazes the strongest i=
n the ?late afternoon, when it begins to set. Deciduous trees that lose the=
ir leaves ?in the winter provide much-needed natural shade to buildings in =
the summer, ?cutting down on the need for air conditioning. ?Heat island sy=

 could worsen the ?crisis. She countered that, when California still had pr=
ice controls in 1999, ?"we still had 16 applications" to build new power pl=

and such contracts are considered poor business practice because they offer=

 system. ?Power rotation. We offered an idea that local businesses have exp=

That is a ?great idea," she responded. "The question is implementation. We =

 that ?the existing "system is for the market, not for the public interest.=

 the supply ?shortage to charge extremely high prices, which led to the ban=

 ?changes in storage management over the past decade as a result of natural=
 ?gas-market restructuring. ??"Many storage gas owners (marketers and other=
 third parties) are minimizing ?inventories in an attempt to synchronize th=
eir buying and selling activities ?more effectively with market needs while=
 minimizing their business costs," ?said Tobin and Thompson. ??In the Unite=
d States, there are three principal types of underground storage: ?depleted=
 reservoirs in oil and gas fields, aquifers and salt cavern ?formations. Sa=
lt caverns are characterized by high withdrawal and injection ?rates and ca=
n usually complete several full cycles per year. This is ?typically referre=
d to as high-deliverability, multi-cycle (HDMC) storage. ??Nationwide, ther=
e are a total of 415 underground storage sites of which 27 ?are salt cavern=
s and 348 are depleted oil or gas fields. The remainder are ?aquifers. All =
together, the storage capacity is 3,899 Bcf (including working ?gas) with a=
 daily deliverability of 77,734 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day. ?The 27 =
salt cavern sites provide 11,416 mmcf of the daily deliverability, ?about 1=
5% of the total. ??"Reflecting the change in focus within the natural gas-s=
torage industry ?during recent years, the largest growth in daily withdrawa=
l capability has ?been from high-deliverability storage sites, which are ma=
inly salt cavern ?storage reservoirs," said the authors of the EIA study. ?=
?Since 1993, when access to interstate underground natural gas storage beca=
me ?completely open, daily withdrawal capability from high-deliverability s=
torage ?facilities has grown by 62% and the number of sites has increased f=
rom 21 to ?27. During this period, the average cycling rate at these facili=
ties has ?increased from 1.66 to 2.10. ??"Because gas can be rapidly inject=
ed/withdrawn from these ?[high-deliverability storage] sites, how full they=
 are on November 1 has less ?significance than inventory levels for deplete=
d or aquifer storage, which are ?designed to cycle (deplete) inventories on=
ce a heating season," Tobin and ?Thompson said. For example, a high deliver=
ability facility with a working gas ?capacity of 1 Bcf could possibly cycle=
 12 Bcf during the calendar year. ?Consequently, the storage operations are=
 not dictated by the need for ?seasonal backup but rather are a function of=
 customers needs. ??Storage assets grow in volume and value?While undergrou=
nd natural gas storage inventories can provide the means to ?meet peak requ=
irements quickly, this can only work up to a point because ?there is not en=
ough known salt dome storage in the country to accommodate a ?total change =
in strategy. Nevertheless, the storage industry is responding to ?these cha=
nges in demand profiles by acquiring, expanding and retrofitting. ??Falcon =
Gas Storage Co. recently acquired the Hill-Lake natural gas-storage ?facili=

 ??"We are very fortunate to have had the unique opportunity to purchase an=

?"We have had numerous discussions with power generators, marketers and ?in=
