Wade,

I work for Steve Kean and he has asked me to coordinate and assist in the
ongoing efforts to secure our employees, their dependents, and Enron property 
in
India.  I understand Mike Hicks is on his way to Mumbai.  However, I have
discussed this with both Steve and Rebecca McDonald and I am sending David
Cromley, Kyle Norosky and John Presley from my group to assist your staff in
completing the arrangements already underway.  By way of background, Jim Roth 
in
London, Dave, Kyle and I are former colleagues.  John also has a similar
background.  Each has skills and experience which I believe will be useful in
accomplishing the tasks at hand and will be able to provide you the support 
and
assistance you require.  They will arrive in Mumbai late Saturday evenning and
will be staying at the Oberoi.

I will attempt to reach you by telephone in a few hours.

Please feel free to contact me at home (281.225.8933) if you receive this 
before
I call you.

John
