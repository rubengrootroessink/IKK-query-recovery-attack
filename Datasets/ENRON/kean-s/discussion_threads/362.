Mary, I just wanted to let you know how great I thought the London meeting 
went using the IP-TV technology.  I found it of very high quality and easy to 
use.  Most people in my department also "tuned-in" for at least some portion 
of the program and all thought it was a resounding success.  A few folks who 
use laptops and docking stations did not have soundcards which meant they 
could see but not hear the presenters.  I and some others minimized the 
screen and continued or normal work while still listening to the audio.  Good 
Job!  We will be looking at this technology as another delivery option for 
our various training programs.

By the way, here is the link for the EBS page which demonstrates what can be 
accomplished using the Enron Net .  Access this directly from the Enron 
Intranet home page.  -Lon-
