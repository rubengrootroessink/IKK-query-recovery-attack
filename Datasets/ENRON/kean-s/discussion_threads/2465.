One of ENA's larger merchant investments is Hanover Compression Company, the 
country's largest compression equipment and servicing company.  Enron's 
investment is valued at about $200 million and we have other commercial and 
operational relationships with the company.

Bill Goldberg, who is Hanover's CFO, has asked to be put in touch with the 
appropriate Enron contact for insight into Enron's perpective on the 
California power situation and our outlook.

Would it be possible to arrange a conference call with you or your designee 
to review our regulatory/political views with Goldberg on this topic?  We 
would like to accommodate this request if possible.

Thank you.
