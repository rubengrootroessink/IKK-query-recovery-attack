I called the Committee lawyers and Andy Black and left a voice mail 
indicating that you wanted to hear Chairman Barton's views on section 102 and 
revenue sharing.

The attached "Good" language is still being worked on, but Dan and I find it 
generally acceptable.  The subcommitte print contains the correct pagination 
for section 102.

Second Issue:  Linda and I wopuld like you to talk to Sen. Wyden about his 
tendency to attack Enron and other marketers given that we have worked with 
his office to develop transparency legislation.  I'll discuss with you once 
you catch your breath.
