The Regulatory Risk WG status --

1. It operated until Project Summer got going in full swing.  We have been 
doing some work lately on Due Diligence framework.  The EBR took some time 
away from the on-going work.

2. Accomplishments -

a. The key thing that we accomplished was to put together a Due Diligence 
framework (which will be on the web page John and Gia are putting together).  
The idea is that Enron should learn from its prior activities (what risks 
associated with key deals)

b. The WG also was instrumental in supporting our analysis of the Top 20 
(most of the key risks were managed by people on the WG).

3. Continuing -

Yes.  Although the WG efforts have to focus on improving the overall culture 
and support for EGA Reg Risk activities.  Also, the WG needs to focus on how 
to grow GA Origination.  I would like to see John and Gia take the lead and 
really work to make this a key part of the knowledge activities.  The WG must 
become the place were we disseminate the key ideas from our activities.

Any further questions, please let me know.

Jim

		 Subject: WORKING GROUP PROGRESS

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

What did the group accomplish?

Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1.
