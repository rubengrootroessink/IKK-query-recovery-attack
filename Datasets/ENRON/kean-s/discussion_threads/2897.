Thanks.  We are always talking about what-if scenarios so that we are 
prepared.
Nothing has been decided and everyone is aware of the potential California 
and national
fall-out.  I completely agree with Sue's fear.   I promise to keep you in the 
loop as ususal
if any of the "talk" sounds serious.

Steve and Rick,

EES is considering "re-sourcing" the new customers in SDG&E's area -- because 
of the uncertainty over whether the CA Procurement Charge will apply to those 
customers.  I think this proposed action needs to be evaluated from a 
nationwide perspective -- this has long-term negative implications for 
Enron's credibility in the DA market as a whole.
