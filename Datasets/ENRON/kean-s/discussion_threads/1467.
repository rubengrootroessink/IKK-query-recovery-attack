Jim and Rob:

I thought you might be interested in seeing a translation of an article tha=
t=20
came out in Gazeta Mercantil (the "WSJ" of Brazil) the day we signed the=20
interruptible gas transportation contract with TBG.  This is the deal we=20
discussed in which we got comfortable with in-country arbitration in Brazil=
=20
based on the relatively small size of the deal, its consistency with our=20
practice in similar trading transactions in other parts of the world, and i=
ts=20
importance to the commercial team in being able to implement our gas tradin=
g=20
strategy in the region.  As you can see below, despite the deal's small siz=

Enron's success in forcing open the market for interruptible gas=20
transportation in Brazil made a big impression.  The commercial team tells =

they now have their sights set on opening the firm service market.  We'll b=

hoping for similar success there.

ENRON BREAKS STATE GAS MONOPOLY
By Nicola Pamplona

The state monopoly on transportation of natural gas ended today with the=20
execution of the first Fuel Transportation Agreement by a private entity in=
=20
Brazil. Enersil, a subsidiary of the North American company Enron, will car=
ry=20
1 million cubic meters of gas per day through the Brasil-Bolivia Pipeline=
=20
(Gasbol), operated by TBG, a company which has Petrobr?s as a majority=20
shareholder. Negotiations with respect to the use of the pipeline have last=
ed=20
for almost a year, punctuated by divergences on price and technical aspects=
=20
of the services.

 The National Oil and Gas Agency (ANP) celebrates the execution of the=20
agreement with a ceremony to take place today at the agency=01,s headquarte=
rs in=20
Rio de Janeiro.  The agreement not only represents the opening of the marke=
t=20
for transportation of natural gas, but also the end of the first arbitratio=
n=20
proceeding submitted to the agency.  According to the involved parties, the=
=20
proceeding was very complicated due to the non-existence of previous=20
standards and to the fact that such market is only in its incipient stage. =
So=20
much so that, after the ANP=01,s decision, it took over a month for the con=

to be ready for execution.=20

 =01&ANP has guaranteed competitiveness to the market and also acquired=20
experience for future arbitration proceedings=018 says Enron Vice-President=
 to=20
regulatory affairs, Mr. Robert Gross.  According to him, the proceeding lea=
d=20
to the definition of a model contract which may be used for future interest=

parties in transporting gas through Gasbol.  The main inclusion was the=20

Gross. Enron, however, has not succeed with respect to pricing the=20
transportation tariff in the agreement which has been fixed to US$ 1,15 per=

million of BTUs (British thermal units).  At the end of last year, when the=
=20
negotiations started, the company was asking for a tariff with a 25% discou=

rate, as it referred to an interruptible service, i.e, services that use=20

Such services can be interrupted by the carrier, namely TBG, in the event t=
he=20
company that has contracted the capacity in first place decides to increase=

the volume  to be transported.  "It is a lower quality service, which is wh=

we requested a lower price", explains the officer.  ANP, however, has=20
understood that  since the volume transported through Gasbol is still very=
=20
far from full capacity, the transport would not in fact be interrupted,=20
incorporating thus the features of non-interruptible service.  "We=20
understand, however that, as the market develops, the tariff for the=20
interruptible services will tend to fall", he states.
