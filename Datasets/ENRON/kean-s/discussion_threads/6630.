This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Pleas=
e=20
note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole brigh=
t=20
spot in the California Legislature...

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
"didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.

"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20
said. "I believe FERC
is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place."

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission."

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before=
=20
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looki=
ng=20
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border). =20

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up=
=20
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned=
=20
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star=20
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and=20
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their=20
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas=
=20
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide=
=20
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets=
=20
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirt=
y,=20
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful t=
o=20
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California=20
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the=20
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up bas=
is=20
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of=
=20
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff
