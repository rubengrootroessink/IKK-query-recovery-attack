Enclosed are two slides that Robert used in his presentation.  Robert 
presented an investment forecast of the nine Gas Distribution companies where 
Enron partcipates. This is $455 million in the next four years 2001- 2004 for 
the expansion of the systems. The reporter incorrecty reported $455 milion of 
Enron investments.

Jose:  Robert spoke today at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo.  I was there and his 
presentation referred to the investment plans of the LDCs in which Enron has 
interests.  He did not say that Enron Brazil would invest $455 million.  
Robert got the data from Rick Waddell.  I'll send you a copy of Robert's 
presentation tomorrow.  Someone should call Adriana Brasiliero to have her 
set the record straight.  I am planning to see her on Wednesday morning.  
Regards, Keith

I just received (10/16  4:39 PM Houston Time) a news flash in my beeper 
service: 

"Enron Brazil to invest $455 million in Gas Distribution" from DJ news

Keith can you trace this. We are selling not investing in Gas distribution.
