This e-mail was mistakely sent to the "other" Mark Schroeder in Omaha.  In 
any event, given our discussion yesterday, do we really want to be jumping 
through hoops for this Indonesian gas firm.  Jane Wilson did mention to me 
yesterday that we were pursuing a JV.  Is that off or likely to be put off, 
given our narrowed focus in Asia/Southeast Asia?   thanks  mcs

Subject: Regulatory/Commercial Advice Needed by PGN/Indonesia


PGN requires the following soonest:

1.   Our comments on their draft Gas Transportation Agreement for 
     delivery of gas to Singapore.   Draft GTA  being DHLed to you 
      by our Jakarta office.  They will be supplying some 350MMCF/day
      to Singapore by 2002.  They need to finish this document this month.
      They request us to make suggested changes directly on the
      text with comments and explanations shown in the margins.

2.   Any papers we have summarizing the principles of gas transportaton
     agreements -- including cross-border agreements.

3.  Laws/language on third party access to pipelines from other
     countries (along with their pros and cons).  They
      need this to help them draft the thrid party access provisions
      for the new Oil and Gas law on which comments are due shortly.

Following is being sent to you by DHL:

4   Copies of the training program on regulatory affairs done for PGN by
     NERA last May.  [confidential].   This is so you and Jane will know
     what PGN already has been taught and not to go over the same ground.

5.   Copies of the advice on a regulatory regime for gas provided to PGN
     by NERA in 1997 (confidential).
