Steve -

As you may know, Murray Weidenbaum, former Chair of the Council of Economic
Advisors, and Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis
will be the Ken Lay Vinson &Elkins Visiting Scholar at the Jones School for
the period January to May 2001. As he is on sabbatical from Washington
University, he will have no teaching requirements of us but has offered to
give some talks around and about for us.

Since Ken Lay once worked for Murray when Murray was Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury, I wondered if Enron might be interested in jointly sponsoring
a breakfast or luncheon talk by Murray sometime after the first of the
year. He is giving a major address to the Detroit Economic Club in Janurary
and I suspect that he will have the basis for a great talk in Houston as well.

In any event because of the title he will hold and because of our many
joint ventures, I wanted to begin the process of finding a partner in this
endeavor.

Let me know what you think.
