Rick Richard sent an Email to you of 1/5/0l recommending support of Daryl 
Owen and Don Santa for positions with the Department of Energy.   Steve Kean 
asked that we give you background on these candidates, and Joe Hartsoe and 
Cynthia Sandherr significantly contributed to this response.  In sum, Don 
Santa is an excellent candidate for the DOE and has a well established record 
supporting competition in the gas and electric industries.  Daryl Owen, while 
a strong candidate, has a less established record on competition.  

Daryl Owen, Principal at Hooper Owen and Winburn seeks the position of Deputy 
Secretary at DOE.  He is a Democrat from Louisiana who is a family friend of 
Rick Richard's.  He formerly served as an Energy Legislative Assistant and 
Administrative Assistant to Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA) from 1981-86; 
and Staff Director, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 
1986-1990.  He has been with first Hooper, Hooper and Owen and now Hoper Owen 
and Winburn since he left the Hill.  His partner, Lindsay Hooper, was former 
Tax Legislative Assistant and Legislative Director to Senator Malcolm Wallop 
(R-WY), 1980-1984.  Other partners include former Congressman Charlie Wilson 
(D-TX).

Daryl's current clients include Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Entergy Services, 
Inc., Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute, TECO Energy, United Pan 
Europe and Waste Control Specialists, Inc..  The firm's energy clients 
include Coastal Corp and the ANR Pipeline.

One potential confirmation concern could track the problem his former 
partner, Nancy Dorn, encountered after Speaker Hastert  announced his intent 
to hire her to work for him.  Specifically, there was negative Washington 
Post front page press coverage concerning the work the firm does for the 
Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Coastal, and the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  Specifically, Pakistan is an issue due to its 
nuclear proliferation.  Further, you may recall, other former Coastal 
employees had difficulties clearing the confirmation process in the Clinton 
Administration due to the company's Libya Sanctions violations.

On the political side, Secretary Designate Abraham has quietly told his 
former chief of staff that he needs a Deputy strong on nuclear defense 
issues.  Further, unless the Bush-Cheney team tells him differently, he would 
prefer to not have a Democrat in the Deputy slot.  Spence Abraham is meeting 
with the Bush-Cheney folks on Thursday, January 11th to discuss who has 
selection rights.  Until then, no decisions will be forthcoming.

Daryl knows much about the oil and gas industry.  As expected, he had strong 
ties to the producer community as a Capitol Hill staffer.  However, he has 
not been particularly active in the electricity restructuring debate on 
behalf of his clients.

Donald (Don) F. Santa, Jr., Senior Vice President for Strategic Planning for 
LG&E Corp. (1997-2001) seeks the position of FERC Chairman or a senior 
position at DOE.  He formerly served as Senior Vice President, Deputy General 
Counsel at LG&E Energy where he managed its public policy group and the legal 
matters for its energy marketing business.  Prior to that, he served four 
years as a  FERC Commissioner (1993-1997) with and  appointment as an 
Independent.  During his tenure, the Commissioner adopted several 
pro-competition Orders, including Nos. 636 and 888.  He also formerly served 
as Counsel  to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee (1989-1993) 
for Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA).  Prior to that, Don was an associate 
attorney with Van Ness, Feldman, Sutcliffe & Curtis (1985-1989.)

Don served as the Chairman of the Electric Power Supply Association's 
(EPSA's) Regulatory Affairs Committee where he strongly advocated the same 
positions as Enron on electric industry restructuring issues.  It is rumored 
that Texas PUC Chairman Pat Wood now wants FERC Chair since Colin Powell's 
son appears a certainty for FCC Chairman.  If this is the case, Don would be 
an excellent DOE candidate.

Finally, although Spence Abraham is expected to be confirmed after his 
hearing on January 18th, Democrats on the Committee intend to speak against 
him for his prior support of legislation to close the Department of Energy.  
As such, his confirmation is not a "sure thing."  

Don would likely not be present the Transition Team with vetting 
irregularities and poses no apparent confirmation concerns.  Cynthia has 
heard from some close to him that he might not be interested in an 
Administration job because it requires a major salary reduction.  Don is a 
native of Connecticut who received his J.D. from Columbia University School 
of Law and his B.A. from Duke University.
