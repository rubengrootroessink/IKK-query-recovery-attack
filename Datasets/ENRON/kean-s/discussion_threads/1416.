you do not need to read all of the articles below, but you asked about how 
much coal trade we do.  One article suggests 4-5 trades a day, and another 
indicates that the ARA (Amsterdam/Rotterdam/Antwerp) contract has traded 1.25 
million tonnes, in 5,000 tonne lots, which my math says is 250 trades as of 
the date of the articles (EnronOnline, so it is the sum of both buys and 
sells).   mcs
