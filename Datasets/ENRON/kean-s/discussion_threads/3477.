Dave may have misspoke at the meeting or I misheard. Anyhow, my research 
suggests there is no overriding support for change, a few yes a few no, but 
mostly apathy. I will probably sum up for group tomorrow based on all 
responses I received and recommend we leave as is.

I don't think "services" was discussed.  The agreement was to call the group 
"professional".

Subject: Proposal to Change "Commercial Support" peer group label to 
"Professional Services"

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider 
retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this 
suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few 
weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively 
across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, 
subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my 
colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before 
returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps 
you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small 
circle of people.

David
