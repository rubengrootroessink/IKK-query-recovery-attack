Jacque Reid, anchor:
To save money, consumers are finding ways to cut down on costly electricity
bills.  Greg Clarking reports on how to get better rates using the Internet.
Greg Clarking reporting:
Helene Baldizzone, a New York City artist, was growing increasingly
concerned about rising electricity costs, so she signed up with start-up
electricity retailer SmartEnergy.com.
Helene Baldizzone (SmartEnergy.com Customer):  I thought, OK, well, let's
try somebody else because the bills had been going up little by little every
month with ConEdison.  So I thought, well, I have nothing to lose at this
point.
Clarking:  Baldizzone is happy with SmartEnergy where she has locked in a
rate of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour.  She was paying as much as 13.3 cents
per kilowatt hour before switching.  SmartEnergy says its goal is to let
consumers take advantage of the sometimes confusing options created by
deregulation of the energy industry.
Gautam Chandra (President/CEO, SmartEnergy.com):  What we are doing is
taking that confusion away by being the agents for the customer in terms of
looking at the best prices, locking in the best prices for them.
Clarking:  SmartEnergy, currently available in New York City, will be
available in all twenty-four deregulated states within the next few months.
There are a number of electricity suppliers in each of the deregulated
states and consumers can save a lot of money by doing a little research.
Rick Cowles (Energyland.com):  Don't sit back and just hang in there and
wait and see what's going to happen a year or two down the road because
you're going to find that electric rates have definitely changed in a year
or two and it may not be to your advantage.
Clarking:  To find out what energy options are available in your area, you
can call your state's public utility commission or click on to
Energyland.com for a complete list of energy suppliers and their rates.
Cowles:  Right now, consumers are kind of in a unique position where they do
have the ability to go in and see some immediate savings.
Baldizzone:  It's easy.  But I like especially saving the money.  It's
better in my pocket.
Clarking:  That's Your Money.  Greg Clarking, CNN, New York.
