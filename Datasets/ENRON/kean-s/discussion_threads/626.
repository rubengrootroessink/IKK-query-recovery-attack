Steve and Rick,

I am very happy to inform you that I just received a call from Salvador 
Beltran. (Salvador is a lawyer who earned an LL.M. at Harvard when I was 
earning mine at B.U. we know each other since 1988)

Salvador is a PAN Member of Congress that is finishing his term, nevertheless 
he is part of the close advisory team for Mr. Fox.  Salvador let me know that 
one of the priority subjects discussed between Mr. Fox and President Zedillo 
was electricity reform and this subject is on tops agenda.

Just yesterday Mr. Fox designated his economic policy advisory team and 
Salvador is part of it.  He told me that in their first meeting with the 
elected president they discussed electric reform as one of the main subjects, 
he also let me know that he might be put in charge of the task force in 
charge of working out the details of the reform.  

I offered 100% of my time to the effort and told him that I was available 
everyday at any hour until this comes to fruition.  He invited me to 
participate in the effort and told me that in the next 10 days he would 
contact me in order to start  working.  I offered him the full support of 
Enron in this effort.

He agreed with me that there is going to be an important window of 
opportunity in the Congressional sessions that will take place from September 
to December of this year and that we have to work hard in order to present a 
proposal that is agreed upon by all of the political actors.

Next Friday, July 14th, I am having a meeting with Geronimo Gutierrez who 
heads the PAN think tank in Congress.  I worked together with Geronimo last 
year when I helped them draft their counterproposal to the President's 
initiative.  I will offer him to work with him on this subject.

This time I am very optimistic.  Let's see what happens.  I'll keep you 
posted.

Best,

Ricardo
