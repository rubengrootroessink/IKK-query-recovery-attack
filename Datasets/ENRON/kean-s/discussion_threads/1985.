As a follow-up to our discussions yesterday, attached is a revised=20
statement/Q&As.  This statement reflects significant changes=20
from the Enron India team.  It has been approved by Wade Cline and Sandeep=

Katwala (legal).   The  issue will probably resurface tomorrow,=20
so your early comments and approval would be appreciated.  I can be reached=

at home (713-572-9556) or cellular (281-948-7273) this evening.

There have been a number of press reports today about the payment issue. =

In addition, there have been a number of India press reports including the=

additional=20
media interest Monday. =20

FYI, Jim Hughes has indicated that Ken Lay wants to advise the US Ambassado=

for electricity it has purchased from

=20
The board owes DPC Rs 262
                     crores of which Enron expected Rs 114 crores would be=

paid by January 6. The board has
                     thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simpl=
y=20
in no position to effect the payment.
                     The situation has been vastly complicated with chief=
=20
minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly
                     refusing to bail out MSEB.=20

                     It is learnt that major lending institutions have=20
convened a meeting in New York on January
                     10 to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to coug=

=20
who have a collective exposure of $1.2

representatives for the meeting. If MSEB does
                     not pay up by then, the institutions may decide to=20
invoke the letter of credit. The implication
                     is that lending institutions may seize MSEB's accounts=
=20
with them and adjust the monies
                     against the dues payable to DPC.=20
                     =20
                     It is learnt that Enron has informed the U.S. embassy =

the intransigent attitude adopted by
                     MSEB and the state government. Incidentally, Enron was=

                     Sources close to Enron said the company might be willi=

to restructure the power

on its payments. But the
                     restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since=
=20
it will require the endorsement by
                     the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra=
=20
Electricity Regulatory Commission.=20

                     The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance=
=20
adopted by Mr Deshmukh will
                     have serious implications since a large number of worl=

                     Citibank, ABN Amro, Bank of America, apart from the=20
governments of the U.S., Belgium and

defaulting will also harm the

=20
have lent money for the controversial
                     venture.=20

                     Enron is hoping that the BJP-led government at the=20
Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to
                     defuse the crisis. But if ultimately no payment is=20
forthcoming, Enron may act tough and
                     invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to th=
e=20
project by the state and the central
                     governments respectively.=20

                     The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he=
=20
was the chief minister in the
                     early nineties. It was first scrapped and later=20
enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv

=20
deal with the Maharashtra
                     government on the controversial Dabhol Power project,=
=20
but has emphasised that the new
                     deal cannot be a unilateral one.=20

                     This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt o=
ut=20
its stand on the issue. Enron India
                     managing director K Wade Cline said, "The deal cannot =
be=20
a unilateral one. MSEB=20
      (Maharashtra State Electricity Board) must continue to pay us for the=
=20
power purchased. We=20
      should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at=20
Dabhol. Obviously, it=20
      must be a deal that works."=20

                     The state government, Cline said, must remember that=
=20
just as it was important for it to sell
                     a deal to its various constituencies, it was important=
=20
for Enron to be able to sell it to its
                     various stakeholders.=20

                     "A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to=20
convince the gas suppliers to rework the
                     agreement that we have signed with them. It also means=
=20
that we will have to convince our
                     lenders," Cline added.=20

                     The $3-billion project has an equity component of $1=
=20
billion and a debt component of $2
                     billion. Cline pointed out that the entire equity as=
=20
well as $1.6 billion in debt had already
                     been brought in. Domestic lenders like ICICI, IDBI and=
=20
SBI have contributed $1.2 billion.=20

                     "The Indian government has a huge exposure to this=20
project through the financial
                     institutions. The governments of Japan, Belgium and US=

 Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms

 Bodhisatva Ganguli & Girish Kuber=20
 MUMBAI=20
         THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board's inability to pay the=20
Enron-promoted Dabhol
         Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of=
=20
phase II of the Dabhol
         project.=20

 The project involves a generating capacity of 1,400 MW and an LNG terminal=
=20
of five million tonnes.=20

 This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over=
=20
phase I may end up in
 arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state=
=20
government refuses to bail out
 the ailing electricity board. As a result, lenders may stop disbursing fun=
ds=20
for phase II.=20

 Enron India=01,s managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening t=
hat=20
international arbitration
 was a real possibility.=20

 The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved throug=
h=20
negotiations. Enron
 officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or t=
he=20
state government.
 Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state=20
government guarantee in order to
 recover its dues.=20

 We have no alternative since if we don=01,t get paid, then our lenders are=
=20
saying that they won=01,t fund
 phase II, Cline said. If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the=
=20
central government=01,s
 counter-guarantee could be invoked.=20

 At a meeting on Friday evening, the MSEB is reported to have asked the sta=
te=20
government to provide
 it a subsidy of Rs 130 crore per month. However, the Maharashtra Chief=20
Minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh
 is said to have flatly rejected MSEB=01,s request.=20

 The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening. The cabinet wi=
ll=20
also discuss the
 formation of a committee to review the project.=20

 The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday, January 9, =
to=20

 situation arising out of MSEB=01,s failure to pay part of the bill for Oct=
ober=20
and the entire bill for November
 amounting to a total of Rs 262 crore.=20

 The project=01,s lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the=
=20
viability of the second phase of
 the project in view of MSEB=01,s failure to pay for power bought from the =
first=20
phase.=20

 Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of $1.89 billion on=
ly=20
about $400 million of debt
 remained to be disbursed. About 80 per of the construction is complete and=
=20
95 per cent of the
