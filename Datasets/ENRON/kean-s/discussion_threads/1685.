Steve,

You requested that I put together a Knowledge Management working group.

To tell you the truth, I got the best support from Elizabeth Linnell.  She 
did a splendid job of coordination and had great ideas of implementation.  
She kept the group alive.

Our main obstacle, aside from other responsibilities, is that other groups, 
specially the eKnow team liked the idea so much that they started calling 
everything "knowledge management" or "expert " without a clear idea of all 
the implications.

A positive discovery was that throughout Enron there are a number of efforts 
that are trying achieve a better situation with respect to information, 
communication and knowledge.  Unfortunately many of this groups are not a 
priority within their business units.

We have an operational  pilot webpage with some interesting content.  

We also drafted two documents.  A first draft of a business plan and a theory 
support document with respect to knowledge.

Our last meeting must have been around August and it is my fault that we have 
not met again but it has to do with my workload in Mexico.  I hope to 
continue with this project by establishing a monthly meeting to arrive to the 
full launch of ther program in our area  A.S.A.P or whenever you set the 
deadline (2nd quarter 2001?)

I would recommend  implementation but, perhaps due to Elizabeth's and my 
responsibilities we would need someone else that devotes more time to the 
implementation of this project.

I think it would be important to develop a working group for training within 
our area.  They could develop programs, ask for changes in current programs 
so that they are also focused to what we do.  Promote the assistance of our 
team to different courses, internal and external, etc. 

Please call if I can be of assistance.

Best,

Ricardo

		 Subject: WORKING GROUP PROGRESS

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

What did the group accomplish?

Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1.
