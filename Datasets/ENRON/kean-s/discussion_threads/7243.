Steve;

Just a few last minute questions:  as regards MD pre-ratings,  at present=
=20
only 32 of 81 MD=01,s are pre-rated; 49 are not.    Do you want them placed=
 on=20
the screen in their pre-rating category?  Do you want all MD=01,s prerated?=
  If=20
so we=01,ll need to chase up with the various BU=01,s.=20

As regards Accomplishments, only 24 of 81 MD=01,s have completed the=20
accomplishments section, 57 have not.

Finally, do you want the MD meeting to comprise two sessions i.e. Commercia=
l=20
and all other Peer Groups (as at yend), or do you want separate sessions? =
=20
Likewise, we can set the system up in all combinations, and you can decide =
on=20
the day of, if that suits you.

Look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.  Gina
