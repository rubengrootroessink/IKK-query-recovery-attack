I talked  with Jamie  Rosenfeld,  the   CERA  SVP     and he  said Dan Yergin 
is 
very much interested in this  type of   advocacy  and  right now is highly 
sought out by TV  and   print media  on these  same   issues which are of 
concern  to Enron -- on  supply  security,  managing  price volatility  and 
supply  turmoil, avoiding regulatory  backlash,  and promoting just  letting 
the  market  work .  Beyond   Dan  taking   media  referrals  and  an Op  Ed 
--  they suggested   several more  ideas.  

1.  November  1-2  is  CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable.  The  day 
before  the Conference Enron  could host  a special  session,  a top 100  
Leadership Circle, or  a special dinner  and   dinnner /speaker  to which key 
media  would  be  invited.  Enron  could  invite  special  attendees  like  
PUC, NARUC  ,  Congressional  types  and other Opiniion Leaders  to attend.  
We  would   get the  shadow  benefit  of   1500-2000  attendees  and media  
in town  for the  Roundtable  the next  day.  

2.
In concert with the  recent  release  of   the   CERA  Electric Power  Trends 
publication,  CERA  would quickly  prepare  a  similar  short  version of  a 
Natural  Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf   already)  and  
Enron   could  purchase  bulk   copies of  each .  We  could  use a  custom  
cover letter  from  Ken and/or Jeff   as the opportunity  to  inform    PUC  
chairs, key  Members  of  Congress,  the  two  Presidential  campaigns' 
leadership  and other Opinion leaders about  issues of importance  to Enron  
and its   businesses  -- this merges nicely  with
the  pro  energy  choice, pro markets, pro deregulation  messages contained 
in the  text and  graphics of  Cera's  Trends  publications.

3.
Enron  could   sponsor     a  10 minute  and  or even  a 30- 40 minute   
Energy  Security  themed  multi media  presentation  full of  intellectual 
content  addressing the  key  electricity  and gas  reliability  and pro 
market forces  messages  Enron is  espousing .We would   advise  target 
audiences in  a  letter  as to how to access  the show on the Cera  media  
center  on their  web site  and  Cera  could  do this in concert with   
EBS.   Or  it   could  be  an add- on  to  the  Trends  publication/ letter  
send  out.  In any case  the multi media message  gets the  advantage of  
exposure  to  the 10 000  eyeballs  the  CERA  site   already offers. 

4.   In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  "did it  right"  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you  ?
