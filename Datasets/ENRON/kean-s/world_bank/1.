Tom,
Rick reminded me that I hadn't responded -- sorry.  Here are my my 
adjustments, but I think the document on the whole is very good.

Subject: Bank lobbying

John:  I have outlined some ideas in the attached draft memo.  I am not clear 
whther we are preparing a formal policy memo articulating why and how we 
should approach the Bank (and other IFIs) or whether I should be doing 
something entirely different.  Give me your thoughts.
