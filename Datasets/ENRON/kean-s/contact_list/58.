This is a draft of the contact  list I promised you.  There are still some typos in it.  I will clean  them up and get send you a draft in the morning that is ready for  circulation.
 
This list is made up  of people that I know and trust.  By an large I have excluded  sitting pubic officials.  In cases where a given organization has several  useful contacts with similar knowledge, I have listed just one person for  now.
 
Give me a call at your  convenience, and we can discuss this in great detail.
