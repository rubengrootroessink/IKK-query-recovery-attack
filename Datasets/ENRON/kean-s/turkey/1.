The following information relates to our equity stake in Turkish oil products 
distributor, OPET. The information contained in OPET.doc is to be included as 
part of an information sheet on OPET and its business partners.  It is 
neither a stand alone document nor a press release.

The attached info sheet will be translated into Turkish and will be included 
in an OPET information packet to be made available to guests (which may 
include some Turkish media) at an official cocktail party this Wednesday, 
Feb. 7, in Istanbul. The reception will be attended by two senior members of 
our commercial team.

The OPET Q&A.doc is an internal document only.

We are routing this information as an FYI in the event that the reception 
receives media attention in Europe.



If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you-
Meredith x 57141
