BIPAC endorses candidate for Special Election PA 9

Pennsylvania 9 Special Election - May 15, 2001 - Representative Bud Shuster
(R) - resigned

Candidates: Bill Shuster (R) - son of incumbent, auto dealer
Scott Conklin (D) - county commissioner from Centre County


It is time for PACs to gear up and take notice of the special election being
held in PA 9.

Bill Shuster's pro-business stance results directly from his numerous years
of insight into the business world.  For the past decade he has owned a
small business in his district.  Prior to owning his own automobile
dealership, he spent years immersed in the auto industry.  He worked for a
supplier in Michigan for a number of years, and he also served as regional
manager for Goodyear in the Washington metro area.

In his BIPAC candidate interview, Mr. Shuster proved that he was very
knowledgeable of the issues that are most important to the business
industry.  His stance on health care, trade issues, market issues,
environmental regulation, and tax reform all were cohesive to the objectives
business hopes to accomplish in the 107th Congress.

Despite the fact that this should be a landslide win with a Republican
running in a Republican district, you will more than likely see a very
competitive race.  There is a weakened Republican base due to competing
factions within the state Republican Party.
