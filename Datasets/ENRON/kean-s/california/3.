December 1, 2000

=20

Honorable James Hoecker

Chairman

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

888 First Street, N.E.=20

Washington, D.C. 20426=20

Dear Chairman Hoecker:

I told you on November 14 in San Diego that, by December 1, I would respond=
=20
to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and=
=20
businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the=
=20
lowest reasonable cost. Obviously, a complete plan by the State of Californ=
ia=20
must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order, and=
=20
final action on that order on December 13. This letter outlines the first=
=20
steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive=
,=20
ongoing discussions with legislative leaders, consumers, business, utilitie=
s,=20
generators, environmentalists, labor, agricultural interests and other=20
California stakeholders.=20

This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the=
=20
concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to=
=20
assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer.

The free market applied to electricity can work, but only if market=20
conditions allow for real competition, and if all parties act responsibly.=
=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has found that the wholesal=
e=20
market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged=
=20
by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable.=20

For that reason, I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that=
=20
are critical -- and clearly within your jurisdiction -- to order retroactiv=
e=20
refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year, and to establish=
=20
hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy=20
marketplace becomes truly competitive. I do not believe that your proposed=
=20
$150/MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection. I again ask=
=20
you to impose real price and bid caps in the $100/MW range on a transitiona=
l=20
basis over the next 36 months.

If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale=20
markets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited=
=20
in scope. I cannot in good conscience, however, forego any measure that wou=
ld=20
serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the=20
sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again.

Since our meeting in San Diego, several things have occurred which influenc=
e=20
my current thinking.

On November 20, 2000 the California Energy Commission (CEC) published the=
=20
results of a detailed bottom-up study of available electricity supply for=
=20
2001. It shows that -- taking into account expected load growth, firm and=
=20
dynamically scheduled imports, and new supply already under construction or=
=20
under contract -- California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie=
s=20
are properly managed and scheduled. This presumes, of course, no gaming or=
=20
withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying.=
=20
But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark=
et=20
power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman=
d.=20
The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of=20
market power and withholding that existed in summer 2000 will exist in 2001=
.=20
You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior.

During the week of November 13-19, while you and regulatory commissioners=
=20
from around the country were in San Diego, California was subjected to=20
several Stage 2 Alerts, reflecting severe shortages of generation, even=20
though these are the lowest load months of the year. Prices were=20
astronomical. More than 12,000 megawatts of generation were off-line at the=
=20
same time, including over 5,000 megawatts for "unscheduled outages." I will=
=20
recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab=
le=20
to meet California=01,s local energy needs, and that information and the=20
authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to=
=20
state and local officials.

On November 22 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and=20
Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) filed comments with you that summarize th=
e=20
current status of their ongoing investigations. They confirm the conclusion=
s=20
of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t=
he=20
exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer=
=20
and fall 2000. The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation=
s=20
by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both=
=20
assist in the understanding of last summer=01,s prices and in the fashionin=
g of=20
remedies to assure that we are not victimized again. I urge you to compel t=
he=20
necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations.

On November 21 the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the=
=20
proposal by PG&E to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated=
=20
utility. The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant=20
unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr=
ed=20
alternative. This suggests that California=01,s course of generation divest=
iture=20
by utilities may be slowed or stopped.=20

With these events as background, I want to describe the steps I have taken=
=20
and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California.

Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure

During the 10 years preceding my administration, virtually no power plants=
=20
were built in California.=20

Since April 1999, six power plants representing 4,700 MW of new generation=
=20
have been approved by the CEC. Five of these plants are under construction=
=20
and the sixth will begin construction no later than April 2001. Twenty more=
=20
applicants have completed pre-filing and have active applications under=20
review by the commission staff. Eleven more applications are in the=20
pre-filing stage.=20

This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds=
=20
to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without=20
abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and=20
environmental protection.

Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation=
=20
in California. With enactment of AB 970 and the creation of the Governor=01=
,s=20
Clean Energy Green Team this September, California has aggressively committ=
ed=20
itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an=
d=20
to coordinate local, state and federal government agency review and action.=
=20

Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the=
=20
construction and operation of new power plants. Through the Green Team, we=
=20
are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges, workin=
g=20
with local air quality districts, the California Air Resources Board and th=
e=20
United States Environmental Protection Agency. These might, for example,=20
expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant, where mobile=20
emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that=
=20
will be generated by the new facility. If necessary, I will seek legislatio=
n=20
to enable these new approaches.

I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to=20
otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and co-generatio=
n=20
where it is viable, cost effective and environmentally sound. The CPUC has=
=20
already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting=20
certificates for transmission facilities, including environmental review.=
=20

Finally, I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici=
ty=20
are available when emergency conditions exist, to avoid interruptions such =
as=20
those experienced last summer and as recently as last week. Suggestions we=
=20
are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating=20
power-plant maintenance and operations activities.

Forward Contracting by Utilities

Many parties, including the FERC, have recommended expanding the use of=20
forward contracting by the utilities including multi-year bi-lateral=20
contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices. The=
=20
contracts, as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio, represent an=20
important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability. I am=20
asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the=20
reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly "second guessing" these=
=20
decisions in later years.

This process should be in place early in 2001 to provide adequate opportuni=
ty=20
for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer 2001.=20

Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio=
n=20
of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi=
a=20
Power Exchange (PX). This issue requires careful consideration since these=
=20
transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure, and=
=20
safeguards are in place to assure delivery. These protections for consumers=
=20
and business must not be lost.

Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a=
=20
cost-effective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain=20
their existing generation, as was recommended in the CPUC's environmental=
=20
impact report regarding PG&E's hydroelectric facilities. There is growing=
=20
consensus around this matter.

I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory=20
decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers.=20

Invigorating the Demand Side

Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of California=01,s energy=
=20
future.=20

Under my Executive Order, the State of California has achieved more than 18=
0=20
MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage 2 alerts, and is moving=
=20
quickly to add another 250 MW of demand reduction for summer 2001. The=20
federal government is following suit for federal facilities. The state and=
=20
federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load=20
reduction initiatives in the private sector.

I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t=
o=20
develop a voluntary 10 percent demand reduction program during peak hours f=
or=20
more than 2,000 groceries statewide. This program must be duplicated in oth=
er=20
areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t=
o=20
work cooperatively toward that end.

I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s de=
mand=20
reduction programs for commercial and industrial users, including the=20
interruptible programs. Those that are successful should be expanded. Those=
=20
that require change should be modified. And new opportunities should be=20
developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply. The=
se=20
programs must be in place no later than March 2001, to provide adequate=20
opportunity for private sector planning and participation.

I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate=
=20
and implement programs which provide real-time price signals and=20
energy-reduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users, and=
=20
to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small=
=20
businesses.

In September, I signed historic urgency legislation that provides $50 milli=
on=20
for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer 2001. I als=
o=20
signed legislation that provides approximately $500 million annually for th=
e=20
next 10 years for energy efficiency, research and development and renewable=
=20
resource support. The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative=20
demand reduction programs using these funds.=20

Institutional Reform

As I testified at the FERC hearing on November 14, I agree that the=20
stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) an=
d=20
California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their=
=20
members and must be replaced. The composition of these boards is specified =
by=20
state law, both as to size and as to qualifications for directors.

I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe=
nt=20
boards that are accountable for their actions, and that will consider both=
=20
the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so.=20

I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem. Your concurrence in=
=20
this effort is extremely important. It will little serve the consumers,=20
utilities, merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in=20
litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in 1935,=
=20
or what traditional state powers, if any, Congress meant to circumscribe or=
=20
override.=20

Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of=
=20
these entities, as some have suggested, I do not intend to let the status q=
uo=20
continue while those debates are carried on. California will alter the=20
composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi=
on=20
to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder=
al=20
law -- protection of the consumers' interests.

In 1996 Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in=
=20
the FERC in moving California=01,s electricity system into an unbundled,=20
federalized mode. Now is the time for you to justify that trust. I want to=
=20
cooperate with you in transitioning to a market-based approach to provide=
=20
this essential service. However, first and foremost, I want you to do your=
=20
job and to let me do mine. Together we can protect the electricity consumer=
s=20
of California and work to restore their confidence.

Sincerely,

=20
