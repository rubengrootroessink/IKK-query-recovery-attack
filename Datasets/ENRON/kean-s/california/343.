			Energy Experts Belie Davis' Rosy Prediction
Summer expected to be crunch time

			Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis' optimistic assessment that California may be 
on the "back side" of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy 
companies and other experts predict. 
			California's real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply 
increases, and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes, predictions are 
that large chunks of the state will be in the dark. 
			"We're not on the back side of this crisis. This problem is far, far bigger 
than the governor is suggesting," said Gary Ackerman, executive director for 
the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park. 
			"To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the 
popular notion we don't have an energy crisis. We do. We have a very serious 
one that's going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up," Ackerman said. 
			The Democratic governor's comments were made Monday in Washington, D.C., 
during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street 
support for his energy plan. 
			He admitted more hard work is needed, but said the state is on the "back side 
of the crisis" because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower 
electricity prices. 
			"Does that mean we're home free?" Davis asked yesterday. "No." 
			But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis. 
			That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator, which 
oversees the state's power market. 
			On any given day in June, the ISO estimates, the state will fall 6,815 
megawatts short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dark, 
if it happens. 
			In July, the expected shortage is 4,685 megawatts. In August, it's 5,297 
megawatts. That's if California has a normal summer. If it's hotter than 
normal, the shortage grows. 
			The ISO's estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis' 
conservation goal. 
			But even if a 10 percent reduction were achieved in June that would save 
roughly 5,000 megawatts, the state would still be short 1,800 megawatts. 
			And there are other variables. 
			Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels, hydroelectric plants may not 
be able to run at full bore, which would also worsen the situation. 
			"That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of," said Sen. Tom 
McClintock, R-Northridge. 
			Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will 
help the state get through this summer. 
			The clock is running. The ISO predicts shortages of 3,030 megawatts in May - 
- just two months away. 
			"The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer, and I don't think 
we've made enough progress there," said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. 
			California won't be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly 
approving and building new power plants, Borenstein said. 
			The ISO's demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come 
online this summer. 
			"Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and 
now," Borenstein said, "we are going to face some serious shortages." 
			Like Davis, Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy. 
Unlike Davis, he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an 
incentive to cut back. 
			But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message. 
			By telling them the worst is over, he could undercut his plan by making 
people believe more conservation is unnecessary. 
			Excluding what lies ahead, there are also plenty of energy issues left 
unresolved right now. 
			Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison 
on purchasing its share of the state's transmission system for $2.7 billion 
-- no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas & Electric or San Diego Gas & 
Electric. 
			Some alternative energy producers, like co-generation plants, are shutting 
down because the cash-poor utilities haven't paid them for several months. No 
cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice. 
			Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy aren't convinced the crisis 
has passed. 
			For starters, both companies are owed in excess of $700 million for 
electricity bought by PG&E and Edison but never paid for. 
			"There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state 
will require this summer, whether there is enough generation on the ground or 
available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in 
demand," said Richard Wheatley, a Reliant spokesman. 
			Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over. 
			"We've said all along it's a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities 
and the energy companies," Rosenfield said. 
			"Now that taxpayers are paying $1 billion every three weeks to buy 
electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between $13 billion and $20 
billion, the companies are happy and the crisis is over. What more could they 
want?"
