These were the only articles w/ polling info on rate increases that Ann could 
find.  I don't think the Chronicle has done an independent poll.

NEWS
Davis Puts His Spin on Energy Crisis / He polls voters, sends faxes defending 
charges of critics

While Gov. Gray Davis is searching for answers to California's energy crisis, 
he also has been polling voters about potential solutions and trying to 
convince "opinion leaders" that he is taking decisive action. 
Interviews with Davis' pollster, lawmakers and those on the receiving end of 
the publicity campaign offer a glimpse into the tight link between policy and 
politics as the governor negotiates a way out of the power crunch.
Recently, as independent polls showed that 3 in 4 Californians believe the 
crisis is the state's No. 1 problem, Davis backed a bill that could lead to 
electricity rate increases after saying for months that he opposed them. 
Last week, the governor's office sent a statement titled "Meeting the Energy 
Challenge" to nearly 2,000 "opinion leaders and decision- makers," touting 
Davis' record and refuting the claims of critics that he has been too slow to 
act. 
Fortuna Union High School District Superintendent Dennis Hanson, whose 
Humboldt County office received one of the faxes, was offended by what he saw 
as an attempt to manipulate him. 
"Making it political provides no solutions," said an angry Hanson, whose 
district is preparing for a utility bill that is potentially $50,000 higher 
this school year. "The unwillingness of anybody to take responsibility 
boggles my mind." 
Davis' aides insist that the governor isn't preoccupied with the views of 
voters despite his political operation polling Californians on the energy 
issue since last summer. Some critics suggest that Davis' fear of a public 
backlash has exacerbated his usual cautiousness and contributed to the energy 
crisis. 
"That's ridiculous," said Davis pollster Paul Maslin. "We do a lot less 
polling than anybody understands. For significant periods of this entire 
issue, there has not been polling going on. It's a far cry from (the) 
perception from recent White Houses where everything must be polled." 
The surveys of Californians, which are paid for by Davis' political campaign, 
help frame issues and determine factors such as the public's willingness to 
conserve, Maslin said. The responses are not used to guide intricate policy 
decisions, he said. 
At the same time, however, Maslin explained that his polling shows residents 
clearly don't want electricity service left to the vagaries of the free 
market; they want some kind of government command of the system; and they're 
willing to trade some rate increases for greater certainty. 
"If you had to boil it down, they want greater control here somehow," Maslin 
said. "I think the governor and the Legislature would be well served to 
listen to that right now." 
In fact, recent proposals by the governor and the Legislature -- such as the 
state's $10 billion purchase of long-term power or a state takeover of the 
utility transmission system -- show they are addressing such concerns. 
Political analysts say Davis' polling reflects a pervasive reliance by 
politicians at all levels of government on public opinion -- a focus that is 
not helpful when confronting a highly technical matter like energy policy. 
Indeed, Davis is not alone. Democratic Assembly leaders recently used their 
own poll numbers to convince colleagues to spend $400 million in taxpayer 
money to buy electricity. 
Polls are crude instruments that pose simplistic questions to people who are 
often uneducated about the issues, said Professor Barbara O'Connor, director 
of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State 
University, Sacramento. 
"I think it's the absence of leadership when politicians base their behavior 
on what people think of them," O'Connor said. 
The state GOP might agree. The party bucked the desires of Republican 
legislative leaders and aired radio commercials last week criticizing Davis' 
leadership on the crisis. The ads began running yesterday in the Bay Area. At 
least one Republican had asked the party to discontinue the ads. 
So far, Maslin said Californians are not blaming Davis for the power 
problems, because they see it as caused by deregulation legislation passed in 
1996, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was in office. 
"The way they view the current governor and the Legislature is: 'Fix it,' " 
he said. " 'We're not blaming you because we understand it didn't happen on 
your watch, but get us out of this mess.' " 
As the state's chief executive, Davis has been criticized by industry 
executives, analysts, lawmakers and regulators for his wariness. 
In contrast, the statement Davis officials faxed last week to police and fire 
chiefs, heads of school districts, municipal officials and the like, praised 
his "bold, decisive leadership." 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio described the fax as a tool for public 
education. 
"It's just information. It's not political at all," Maviglio said. "This is 
part of a continuing effort the governor's office has done to inform the 
community about the governor's actions and policies. It was first used during 
the education proposals last year." 
Outraged utility executives, meanwhile, said the governor's fax wrongly 
blamed them for not being more proactive. 
"I'm appalled by reading such a statement," said Harold Ray, executive vice 
president of Southern California Edison Co. 
Ray was particularly irked by a passage about long-term contracts between the 
state's major utilities and power providers. The governor's fax claimed that 
since Davis appointed Loretta Lynch president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission last March 22, the PUC has approved every request from the 
utilities for authority to sign long-term contracts "in a timely fashion." 
Ray claims that signing contracts directly with generators instead of through 
a state-run exchange could have saved his company about $1 billion. 
On Aug. 3, the commission ostensibly gave the utilities authority to sign 
such contracts, but Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. executives say 
the regulators refused to approve contracts or to provide guidelines for 
them. 
The commission's energy division is supervised by Lynch. She told The 
Chronicle that the utilities should simply have acted without guidance from 
commission staff. 
Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, chair of the Rules Committee, said he 
believes that the PUC has contributed to energy market dysfunction in recent 
years. 
Cardoza, however, praised Davis for now aggressively pursuing new generating 
plants in California, and said any spin control will likely be irrelevant in 
the end because results will be what matters. 
"I don't think any amount of damage control is going to fix things if we 
don't get control of this," said Cardoza. "If we're able to solve the 
problem, we get kudos. If we don't, we get dinged."

NEWS
Californians Cast a Cold Eye At Power Crisis, Polls Find / Shortages join 
education as top concern

Yes, the energy crisis is serious, but most Californians see it as a plot by 
power companies seeking to jack up utility bills, according to the latest 
energy poll by the Field Institute. 
The poll released today found Californians growing more dubious about the 
roots of the so-called crisis. More than half of those surveyed, 57 percent, 
said the shortage amounts to an attempt to raise rates, rather than an 
emergency born purely from lack of generating sources or from increased 
demand.
Real or fabricated, the public is overwhelmingly concerned about the crisis 
and is staying tuned to news of blackouts and energy grids (both the Field 
Poll and one from the Public Policy Institute of California show almost 
everyone is following the news). 
In fact, the energy shortage has joined education as a top concern for 
Californians, according to the Public Policy Institute poll, also released 
today. That poll reveals that almost 75 percent of Californians say energy is 
"a big problem" and only about half of those polled think economic good times 
are ahead -- a drop from 72 percent in August. 
And state residents are mad at just about everyone for the energy situation 
and the looming shortages. 
"The public is in a pretty foul mood," said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll. 
"They blame just about everybody. . . . The public is pretty cynical about 
how we got to this situation." 
When asked who's to blame for the situation, about three-quarters of those in 
the Field Poll pointed the finger at failure to build new power plants, the 
state's private utility companies and the state Public Utilities Commission. 
More than 60 percent blamed the federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the 
state Legislature, activist groups that blocked new plant construction and an 
increase in industrial energy use. 
Gov. Gray Davis, however, came out on top of the electrical heap, with only 
43 percent blaming him for the current situation. Fifty- three percent blamed 
his predecessor, Pete Wilson. 
Most respondents said they take at least somewhat seriously the potential for 
utility company bankruptcy and with it the threat of blackouts. When it comes 
to solving the problem, most want the state government to step in and become 
a middleman, buying electricity for the utility companies, the Field Poll 
found. 
Davis has argued that the state can get better prices because of its good 
credit rating. The electricity would then be sold to the power companies. 
In order to fix the problem, most Californians, 61 percent, think the state 
should go back to regulating the energy industry. Only 30 percent of those in 
the Field Poll said they think the crisis can be solved without 
re-regulation. 
In the Public Policy Institute's poll, only 37 percent advocated 
re-regulation, with 32 percent favoring the construction of more power plants 
and 20 percent leaning toward more conservation. 
Although they are deeply concerned about the energy shortage, most 
Californians responded in the Field Poll that they don't want air quality 
standards relaxed to produce more electricity. Only 32 percent thought that 
solution was satisfactory. 
But when asked if air quality standards should be relaxed in some areas to 
get older plants functioning and to speed approval of new plants, 
Californians were more divided. Almost half, 47 percent, approved of that 
strategy. Forty-six percent opposed it. 
The energy problems don't bode well for the state, according to those 
surveyed by the Public Policy Institute. Eighty-two percent said they thought 
the issue will damage the state's economy in the next few years, with more 
than half saying it will hurt the economy "a great deal." 
"Californians are deeply worried about the implications of this crisis for 
the state economy and their own pocketbooks," said the institute's survey 
director, Mark Baldassare. "Right now, they are still holding out hope, but 
their optimism, as well as the political fortunes of state leaders, may 
suffer if they fail to see some action soon." 
The private nonpartisan research institute conducted its survey Jan. 2-8, by 
phoning 2,011 residents. The Field Poll surveyed 1,001 Californians Jan. 
12-16.
