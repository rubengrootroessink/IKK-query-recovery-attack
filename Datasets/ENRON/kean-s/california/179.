Pacific Gas & Electric Co., saddled with $9 billion in wholesale power cost=
s=20
it could not collect and with costs increasing by $300 million per month,=
=20
filed Friday for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.=20
Bankruptcy Code.

Under Chapter 11, the utility unit of PG&E Corp. will be given time to=20
reorganize its precarious financial situation, including the restructuring =
of=20
its massive debt. The filing in no way impacts PG&E or its other=20
subsidiaries, including National Energy Group.=20

"We believe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is the best=20
alternative to protect the legal rights of Pacific Gas & Electric and to=20
allow us to continue serving our (13 million) customers," said Pacific Gas =
&=20
Electric Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr., during a Friday teleconference.=20


Four primary reasons for filing
In a teleconference on Friday April 6, Glynn listed four primary reasons fo=
r=20
filing for Chapter 11, including:=20

Failure by California to assume the full procurement responsibility for the=
=20
utility's "net open position," which the company said was provided for. Thi=
s=20
resulted in Pacific Gas & Electric continuing to be exposed to purchase cos=
ts=20
totaling an estimated $300 million-plus per month.=20
"We don't actually know how much we owe the DWR (California Department of=
=20
Water Resources) or the ISO (California Independent System Operator), becau=
se=20
they've never told us," Glynn said.=20

Actions taken by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on March=
=20
27 and April 3, which Pacific Gas & Electric said created new payment=20
obligations and undermined its ability to return to financial viability.=20
Those actions included mandating Pacific Gas & Electric pay the full amount=
=20
of the bills presented by qualifying facilities, and that the utility "pay=
=20
out more in cash to DWR than we collect in rates," according to Glynn.=20

Lack of any progress in negotiations between the company and the state=20
concerning the $9 billion in excess wholesale power costs spent since last=
=20
June.=20
"Talks were going nowhere; we would reach agreements that were then not=20
followed up on," Glynn said. "We've heard a lot of words come out of=20
Sacramento, but the challenge was to follow up with action."=20

The adoption by the CPUC of what Pacific Gas & Electric called an illegal a=
nd=20
retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate the company's=
=20
uncollected wholesale costs.=20
The CPUC ruled that the utilities offset their wholesale power costs agains=
t=20
the transition costs collected from ratepayers.=20

The order also requires the utilities to offset their operating costs with=
=20
the money they make from selling power from their own generating units duri=
ng=20
the rate freeze. The companies believe that if the order isn't changed, the=
y=20
could not recover past purchased power expenses.=20

PG&E PROFILE SPREADSHEET

Many not surprised
Analysts for the most part were not surprised that Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
took Friday's action, many saying they had expected a filing weeks ago.=20

"I always believed this was the smartest way to deal with this debacle," sa=
id=20
Bill LeBlanc, vice president of retail consulting for Boulder, Colorado=20
research and consulting firm E Source=01*the retail-energy wing of FT Energ=
y. "I=20
expect Southern California Edison to follow suit; I had actually expected=
=20
these utilities to file Chapter 11 about eight weeks ago."=20

LeBlanc said he expected a Chapter 11 filing, because California will not=
=20
bail out the utilities, and they have no way to recover costs in an=20
expeditious manner in what they believe is economically fair to their=20
corporation and customers.=20

Governor's acquiescence didn't help
Even a short press conference Thursday by California Gov. Gray Davis, in=20
which he finally admitted a rate hike was needed, and his proposal to provi=
de=20
as much as $8 billion in bonds to pay the utilities' past power costs, coul=
d=20
not deter Pacific Gas & Electric's filing.=20

The governor's words had little effect on Glynn. "Did we hear the governor'=
s=20
speech last night? We heard a lot of words, but we have not seen the=20
actions," Glynn told his teleconference audience.=20

"Almost every day since this crisis began, we have looked at staying out of=
=20
bankruptcy, vs. entering bankruptcy," Glynn said. "We expect the court to=
=20
provide the venue needed to reach a solution which the state and regulators=
=20
have been unable to achieve."=20

"This (bankruptcy filing) really wasn't unexpected; this company has been=
=20
making noise like this for weeks," said Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein ener=
gy=20
analyst Linda Byus. "The governor probably expected that he made a big nois=
e=20
last night with his announcement, but these guys said no, not really."=20

"It's a very unfortunate situation, extremely complicated," according to=20
Jeffrey Holzschuh, managing director and head of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter=

Global Energy Group. "There are just so many people involved in this that I=
=20
don't think you can come to conclusion quickly or easily."=20

What bankruptcy offers is a utility "czar," a court judge with virtually=20
unlimited power, legal scholars said. The judge will hold the situation in=

"Bottom line is the judge has total control," according to Robert Nachtmann=

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency powe=
r=20
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001)=20
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a=
=20
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order=
=20
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state=20
without guarantee of payment.=20
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect b=
ut=20
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plan=
t=20
off-line for maintenance.=20
On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California=
=20
landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction=
=20
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.=
=20
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20=
=20
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell fou=
nd=20
that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat."=20
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals=
=20
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a hi=
gh=20
likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal.=20
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the=20
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel=20
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in=
=20
July.=20
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least=20
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which=20
maintains and controls power transmissions.=20
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down a=
ny=20
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.=20
"It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change=
=20
anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a=20
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely=
=20
could have a system emergency."=20
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but=20
declined to specify their next move.=20
"Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company=
=20
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate."=20
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. Distric=
t=20
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,=
=20
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and=
=20
production of electricity.=20
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of=
=20
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n.=20
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sale=
s=20
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,=
=20
and that goes directly to an appellate court.=20
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two=
=20
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even thoug=
h=20
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopeless=
ly=20
in debt.=20
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't p=
ay=20
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales =
to=20
the utilities.=20
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houst=
on=20
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &=20
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue=20
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required =
to=20
sell to companies that are not creditworthy.=20
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators c=
an=20
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.=20
"My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however,=
=20
that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don't have a tool to=20
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do" -- respond to=20
emergency demands for power.=20
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no=20
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generator=
s=20
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must=20
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.=20
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special=
=20
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.=20
"Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court=20
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he=
=20
said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short=
=20
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially a=
t=20
risk."=20
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for=
=20
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amen=
d=20
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its=
=20
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge h=
as=20
jurisdiction.=20
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.=20
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for=20
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the bi=
g=20
utilities and sell its power on the open market.=20
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants=
=20
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in=20
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell=
=20
its power to PG&E.=20
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative=
=20
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell=
=20
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.=

Dan Walters: Hertzberg's oversight is looking more like a whitewash


(Published April 9, 2001)=20
When Bob Hertzberg was elevated into the Assembly speakership a year ago, h=
e=20
pledged to make a priority of what's called "oversight" -- the much-neglect=
ed=20
legislative duty to examine how administrative agencies operate programs.=
=20
"We pass all these bills," Hertzberg said in a speech shortly after being=
=20
elected speaker. "What do they mean? What did they do? We intend to do a=20
great deal of oversight."=20
Seemingly, Hertzberg made good on his pledge when the Assembly conducted an=
=20
exemplary, bipartisan investigation of state Insurance Commissioner Chuck=
=20
Quackenbush's questionable regulation of insurers. The Assembly investigati=
on=20
was the key factor in Quackenbush's decision to abandon his once-promising=
=20
political career.=20
Flaying Republican Quackenbush for his shortcomings was relatively easy for=
=20
Democrat Hertzberg. Would he, many wondered, be equally eager to examine=20
wrongdoing, or simple incompetence, by Democratic officeholders, especially=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis?=20
The answer, apparently, is no. While there are many potential targets for=
=20
deeply probing legislative examinations, Hertzberg and his much-vaunted sta=
ff=20
of investigators have not given them the same attention as Quackenbush=20
received.=20
Early this year, the Hertzberg hit team went to work on the energy crisis,=
=20
and Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, was appointed to chair a=
=20
special committee that was to delve into how the crisis came to pass. But=
=20
after fiddling around with the matter for several weeks and failing to=20
pinpoint some easy villains, the investigation sputtered.=20
The moratorium on oversight occurred just as the committee was moving into =
an=20
area that could have been embarrassing to Davis and state Public Utilities=
=20
Commission President Loretta Lynch -- what they did or did not do last summ=
er=20
when the crisis first became apparent. It's an area of inquiry whose=20
importance was magnified by Friday's bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas and=
=20
Electric Co. Republicans complained about the investigation's shutdown, but=
=20
to no avail.=20
The hollowness of Hertzberg's oversight pledge was demonstrated again the=
=20
other day when a subcommittee of the Assembly Governmental Organization=20
Committee staged what it described as an "informational hearing" on what ar=
e=20
arguably the state's two most dysfunctional agencies, the Department of=20
Veterans Affairs and the California National Guard.=20
The former is a mess from top to bottom and has been for years. Its two maj=
or=20
functions, providing home loans to veterans and operating two residential=
=20
facilities for aged and/or ill veterans, have been plagued by mismanagement=
=20
and downright neglect. It's been a notorious dumping ground for political=
=20
hacks through several gubernatorial administrations. Agency secretaries hav=
e=20
come and gone in clouds of personal scandal.=20
Revelations about the National Guard are more recent but equally disturbing=
.=20
Its readiness for either active military duty or responding to state=20
disasters has declined, and its non-military programs supposedly serving=20
delinquent youths are marginally effective at best and riddled with financi=
al=20
irregularities. Under Adj. Gen. Paul Monroe, the Guard has become top-heavy=
=20
with cronies while Monroe has feuded openly with his second-in-command, Eze=
ll=20
Ware. At one point this year, Monroe unilaterally dumped Ware from the slot=
=20
to which he had been appointed by Davis, but within four days Ware was=20
restored to his deputy's position.=20
The subcommittee's chairman, first-term Assemblyman Ed Chavez, D-La Puente,=
=20
conducted what can only be described as a sham hearing, allowing bureaucrat=
s=20
for both agencies to emit a blizzard of self-serving statements and data wi=
th=20
little or no questioning, and then praising them for their appearances.=20
Monroe, he said, "showcased the National Guard as we had hoped."=20
If the aborted energy investigation and the Chavez hearing were what=20
Hertzberg had in mind as "oversight," a better word might be "whitewash."=

PG&E awards bonuses hours before filing Chapter 11=20



ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
April 8, 2001=20
SAN FRANCISCO =01) As a reward for "staying the course" the parent company =
of=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. awarded about 6,000 bonuses and raises to=20
midlevel managers and other employees hours before the utility filed for=20
bankruptcy, a newspaper reported.=20
PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn issued an internal memo late Thursday that=
=20
incentive payments denied in January would be awarded to eligible employees=
=20
at the subsidiary utility.=20
The payments were made in time for many of the bonuses to be deposited into=
=20
workers' bank accounts before the utility filed for Chapter 11 Friday=20
morning, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday after obtaining a co=
py=20
of the memo.=20
Gov. Gray Davis issued a brief statement Saturday in response saying "PG&E'=

Glynn applauded the employees' "efforts, teamwork and dedication during the=

past year, and particularly throughout the ongoing energy crisis," he wrote=
.=20
"Thank you for staying the course."=20
The bonuses and raises were earned as part of the company's incentive=20
program. In January, the amount owed to employees who met their department=

objectives was estimated at $83 million, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokesm=
an=20
Ron Low said Saturday.=20
The amount paid out was less than the earlier estimate because top-level=20
company executives were exempt from payment. Low did not have a dollar figu=
re=20
for the amount paid out but said it was based only on department objectives=

Low said the money came from a combination of a $1.1 billion tax refund,=20
paying power generators only what the company receives in rates and cash=20
conservation within the company such as halting the installation of=20
underground distribution lines.=20
The raises and bonuses were given to secretarial staff, midlevel managers a=
nd=20
other support staff. No money was distributed to rank-and-file union member=
s=20
who already received a wage increase earlier this year as part of their=20
contract, Low said.=20
The performance-based bonuses can equal up to four weeks of an employee's=
=20
regular salary, said company spokesman John Nelson.=20
Annual raises average 3 percent of an employee's salary and are meant to=20
balance cost-of-living expenses, he said.=20
Los Angeles lawyer David Huard of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips said the practi=
ce=20
of compensating employees prior to filing Chapter 11 is not uncommon. In=20
addition, the U.S. bankruptcy court in San Francisco granted approval for=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to make outstanding compensation payments to=20
employees and to maintain related bank accounts.=20
"It's not unusual for corporations anticipating bankruptcy to sweeten the p=
ot=20
and encourage management to stay," Huard said.=20
But Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks, said it's disgraceful=

The utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy=
=20
law, which means it plans to reorganize and pay off its debt over time. The=

while rates were frozen under deregulation and wholesale power costs soared=
.=20
"The holding company vacuumed all of the assets out of the utility and is=

Reform Network in San Francisco.=20
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, a lawyer=
=20
who worked on the Chrysler bankruptcy, predicted one benefit of the=20
bankruptcy will be that generators accused of gouging California will not g=
et=20
full payment.=20
"There is no way generators expecting to get paid 100 cents on the dollar=
=20
come out of a bankruptcy with 100 cents on the dollar," Bowen said.=20
The surprise PG&E announcement came the morning after the governor used a=
=20
statewide televised address to reassure the public that he had a plan for=
=20
ending the crisis, which included paying off the utilities' huge debt.=20
But PG&E, which has resisted state purchase of its transmission system in=
=20
exchange for payment of its debt, said it concluded that the court offers t=
he=20
best way out while the utility continues routine service to customers.=20
"The regulatory and political processes have not provided a solution, and n=
ow=20
we are turning to the court," said Robert Glynn Jr., chairman of PG&E Corp.=
=20
Glynn said Davis aides did not meet with PG&E for more than three weeks whi=
le=20
they tried to wrap up the Edison deal and that they then did little in a=20
meeting this week.=20
"We have heard a lot of words from the Sacramento sources that simply have=
=20
not come to fruition," Glynn said.=20
The governor, who used the televised address to drop his opposition to a bi=
g=20
rate increase and propose one of his own, was not happy to learn that he ha=
s=20
lost his battle to keep the utilities out of bankruptcy.=20
"I believe PG&E has dishonored itself," Davis said as he signed a bill in=
=20
downtown San Diego yesterday. "It has created undue alarm among 34 million=
=20
citizens of this state."=20
Davis acknowledged that the PG&E bankruptcy may force him to alter his resc=
ue=20
plan based on the principle that the utilities must give the state somethin=
g=20
in exchange for aid in paying off their debts.=20
To make the deal work, he said, he needs the transmission systems of all=20
three utilities: PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric.=20
The judge and the creditor committees presumably would have to approve the=
=20
sale of the PG&E transmission system. If that is not possible, Davis said, =
he=20
will negotiate for "comparable assets," such as the hydroelectric facilitie=
s=20
owned by the utilities.=20
The governor's plan would give the utilities part of the revenue from the=
=20
monthly bills paid by their customers -- a "dedicated rate component" -- th=
at=20
could be used to finance an $8 billion bond to pay off their debts.=20
In San Diego, the governor signed a bill that extends the SDG&E rate cap to=
=20
businesses, retroactive to Feb. 7. He appeared earlier at an Escondido=20
elementary school, where he praised student conservation efforts.=20
Davis told reporters that PG&E chairman Glynn told him a week ago that the=
=20
PG&E board was one vote short of filing for bankruptcy and that seeking a=
=20
solution in the court was "a very real option."=20
The governor said PG&E chose to further its own interests, not the best=20
interest of Californians. In contrast, he said, PG&E's creditors have acted=
=20
responsibly and shown faith in negotiations by not pushing the utility into=
=20
bankruptcy.=20
"I am pleased that Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electri=
c=20
are allowing us to negotiate a settlement as opposed to forcing this matter=
=20
into bankruptcy," he said.=20
Davis said he planned to attend a previously scheduled meeting yesterday=20
afternoon with John Bryson, Edison's top executive, to work on the final=20
issues in the purchase of its transmission system.=20
"We are down to a few remaining issues that we hope to work out within the=
=20
next very few days," Davis said.=20
Southern California's parent, Edison International, yesterday emphasized th=
e=20
importance of completing the sale of the transmission system quickly to=20
prevent creditors from taking the utility into bankruptcy.=20
Lynn LoPucki, a UCLA law professor who specializes in corporate bankruptcie=
s,=20
predicted that Edison will follow PG&E into bankruptcy. He said the two=20
utilities have comparable business plans and have made similar decisions so=
=20
far.=20
"They have pretty much marched together on this," LoPucki said.=20
PG&E and Edison say they ran up a combined debt of $13 billion when their=
=20
rates were frozen under deregulation last year and wholesale power costs=20
soared.=20
After generators refused to extend the utilities more credit, the state was=
=20
forced to begin buying power for utility customers in mid-January. The stat=
e=20
has spent more than $4 billion so far, most of it on the expensive spot=20
market.=20
The state has signed more than $40 billion worth of long-term contracts to=
=20
provide cheaper power during the next 10 years. The state general fund will=
=20
be repaid by a bond of $12 billion or more, paid off by ratepayers over a=
=20
dozen years.=20
Glynn said PG&E decided to declare bankruptcy because the PUC, while raisin=
g=20
the utility's rates last week, gave the additional money to the state for i=
ts=20
power purchases and imposed new costs on PG&E by requiring the utility to p=
ay=20
small nonutility generators.=20
In addition, said Glynn, the PUC adopted an "illegal and retroactive=20
accounting change" advocated by consumer groups that would have counted=20
transfers to the parent firm to offset the estimate of the utility's debt.=
=20
But another important factor was that the state has not been paying for=20
expensive last-minute power acquisitions made by the Independent System=20
Operator to keep the grid at minimum levels.=20
Glynn said the state has been improperly assigning the cost of this expensi=
ve=20
emergency power to PG&E, increasing the utility's debt at an estimated rate=
=20
of $300 million a month.=20
Ironically, federal regulators ruled yesterday that generators cannot be=20
forced to sell emergency power to the California grid if the utilities can'=
t=20
pay for it. Now the state may have to begin paying for the emergency power.=
=20
PG&E contends that if the PUC had approved its request for a rate increase=
=20
last fall, the utility would have raised rates less than the PUC and Davis=
=20
have proposed, obtained cheap long-term power contracts, and thus the state=
=20
would not have had to begin buying power.=20
Under bankruptcy, PG&E said it will be able to pay all new bills, continue=
=20
normal service to its customers, and provide health care and other benefits=
=20
to its employees and retirees. But payments on bonds and loans may be=20
suspended, the utility said.=20
Glynn said he expected bankruptcy to aid shareholders by halting PG&E's=20
mounting debt. But the surprising move caused the stock of all three=20
California utilities to drop yesterday, and trading in PG&E stock was halte=
d=20
briefly.=20
Some small nonutility generators that operate under the federal "qualifying=
=20
facilities" program have formed a creditors committee, the first step towar=

taking Edison into bankruptcy.=20
A spokesman for the creditors committee, Jack Raudy, said yesterday that=20
PG&E's bankruptcy "underscores the state's critical need for a real solutio=
n=20
without further delay."=20
The generators who formed the creditors committee get power from "renewable=

While attorneys for the state's largest utility were filing for bankruptcy=

=20
investment.=20
At a committee hearing in the County Administration Building yesterday, PG&=
E=20
National Energy Group urged a California Energy Commission committee to=20
approve plans for a 510-megawatt power plant on Otay Mesa. Operators of two=

power plants in the county opposed the request, saying it could result in=
=20
dirtier skies.=20
"We're focused on getting this plant on-line as soon as possible," project=

manager Sharon Segner told the panel. "Any (commission) delay, whether it's=

2003 .?.?. The schedule is already tight."=20
The bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas and Electric has no effect on the Otay=
=20

nd=20
of the day, we are separate companies," she said after the hearing.=20
The Otay Mesa application, which has been in the works for more than three=
=20
years, is expected to be considered by the full commission April 18. The=20
plant would provide enough power for roughly 380,000 homes and businesses.=
=20
The siting committee has indicated its support for the project, but the=20
hearing yesterday was intended to give opponents and members of the public =
an=20
opportunity to testify for and against the plant.=20
Attorneys for the owners of the Encina and South Bay power plants urged the=
=20
committee to reject the Otay Mesa project, saying the area's natural-gas=20
pipelines could not accommodate enough fuel to supply another plant.=20
What's more, lawyers for Duke Energy and Cabrillo Power said, the Otay Mesa=
=20
plant could only run on natural gas. The two existing plants can run on=20
natural gas or fuel oil, which causes more pollution. If there are natural=

gas shortages, the lawyers said their clients would have to burn the dirtie=
r=20
fuel.=20
"We would be criticized for that publicly," said Jane Luckhardt, an attorne=

for Duke Energy, which operates the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. "We wil=
l=20
be forced to purchase very expensive (smog) emission credits."=20
A consultant for Cabrillo Power, which co-owns the Encina plant in Carlsbad=
,=20
also told the committee that the Otay Mesa facility would hurt his clients.=
=20
Robert Weatherwax of Sierra Energy and Risk Assessment told the panel that=
=20
allowing the Otay Mesa plant would create as much as 800 tons of smog,=20
although he did not specify over how long a period the extra smog would be=
=20
created.=20
The new power plant "will force Encina and South Bay to burn more oil,"=20
Weatherwax warned.=20
The PG&E National Energy Group said it will get much of its fuel from a=20
natural gas pipeline scheduled to be built between Blythe and Tijuana. Gas=
=20
from that line would power both the Otay Mesa plant and another in Rosarito=
,=20
Mexico, company officials said.=20
"There's no nexus between our proceeding and their issues," Segner said of=
=20
the complaints from Duke Energy and Cabrillo Power attorneys.=20
The Otay Mesa power plant application won praise from several business grou=
ps=20
as well as Supervisor Bill Horn, who urged the committee to approve the=20
project as soon as possible.=20
Horn said he received numerous complaints from area biotechnology firms aft=

rolling blackouts hit San Diego County for the first time last month. Three=

The Otay Mesa project "will play a key role in solving the energy problem=

that's plaguing San Diego County," Horn told the committee. While the plant=

would brighten the West's electricity supply picture, there is no requireme=

that the power generated at the Otay Mesa plant be used in San Diego County=

The project was opposed by some environmentalists, who chastised the=20
California Energy Commission for relying too heavily on fossil fuels for th=

WASHINGTON -- Back in 1997, as California's experiment with electricity=20

Most notably, there seems to be no consensus on the wisdom of slapping=20

"I think there are Republicans who are very supportive. And we hope that th=

But Tim Ransdell, executive director of the nonpartisan California Institut=

"If there was a silver bullet for this, if there was a single obvious remed=

?????CHICAGO--For all its energy notoriety and outrage over surging=20

Hawaii. California, in fact, is barely in the top 10 when it comes to=20

?????One of the reasons that Californians have been paying less is because=

?????All this after two decades of steadily declining electricity rates in=

the U.S.--with almost all of the price drops preceding the deregulation tha=
t=20
was supposed to bring down prices.

?????Price of Power Fell Steadily for Years
?????In the early 1980s, one kilowatt hour of power cost residential=20
customers about a dime. Over the next two decades, Americans began to emplo=

?????At the same time, utilities took advantage of low interest rates to he=

nuclear reactors, and they were thus able to pass on further savings to=20
customers.
?????By last year, buying a kilowatt hour set the average American back jus=
t=20
7.5 cents.
?????The trend has suddenly stopped.
?????In a forecast released Friday, the Energy Information Administration=
=20
predicts that a kilowatt hour will cost about 8 cents on average nationally=
=20
by the end of this year and rise another half-cent in 2002.
?????"For the first time in a long time, the prices are going up," said=20
administration forecaster Neil Gamson.
?????A one-cent increase in the price per kilowatt hour would boost the=20
monthly bill of a typical California residential customer by about $10, to=

$117. For big industrial users, the extra monthly cost could be in the=20
thousands.
?????Substantial regional differences have always existed, with the Northea=

the longtime home of the highest prices in the continental U.S. Some=20
Northeastern customers pay twice as much, or more, than consumers 3,000 mil=

?????One reason is that, although environmental laws in the Northeast are=

concerns and tougher anti-pollution legislation have forced utilities to=20

?????The Northeast is also farther from most major sources of fuel, includi=

?????Several states in the Northeast, including Connecticut, Maine, New=20
Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts, are actively deregulating. Like=20
California, only with less drama, they are finding the birth of a free mark=

painful and expensive.
?????Under Massachusetts' deregulation statute, the standard retail rate fo=

However, the rise in natural gas prices has left utilities pleading with=20
regulators to allow them to raise prices, lest they face California's probl=
em=20
of selling their power at a loss--precisely the circumstance that led the=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of San Francisco to declare bankruptcy Friday.

?????Kilowatt Hour's Average Cost Rising
?????Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Electric Co. got the go-ahead to=
=20
charge 270,000 residential customers an additional 23%. Statewide, analysts=
=20
say, the average price of a kilowatt hour is probably edging up from its=20
already high October figure, the last available, of 11.2 cents.
?????In New York, the average cost of a kilowatt hour statewide was 14.1=20
cents in October. However, even under a deregulation plan that won't fully=

free the utilities from price controls until 2002, some New York City=20
residents have seen their rates rise by nearly 20%, to 13.9 cents a kilowat=

?????Still, Cornell University economist Tim Mount said he would be surpris=

Judge in PG&E Bankruptcy Case Seen as a Problem Solver=20

Courts: Dennis Montali will face unprecedented legal complexities.=20

By MAURA DOLAN, Times Legal Affairs Writer=20




*

Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali is called a "reasonable man."
AP

?????SAN FRANCISCO--U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who will oversee=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy reorganization, is a highly respect=
ed=20
scholar and effective mediator known for persuading reluctant parties to=20
reach agreement.
?????In a recent case, Montali achieved in only three days a settlement=20
between a debtor and creditors in the bankruptcy of an international=20
engineering firm. The case had been in bruising litigation for two years wh=
en=20
another judge asked Montali to mediate it.
?????As a lawyer, Montali helped divert a statewide agricultural crisis 10=
=20
years ago by persuading warring factions to accept a deal in the bankruptcy=
=20
of an agricultural cooperative, according to a lawyer in the case.
?????"He is very good at not embarrassing people but getting them to=20
understand they are wrong," said lawyer Larry Engel, who has known and work=
ed=20
with Montali for two decades.
?????Montali, 60, the son of a winemaker, grew up in San Francisco and now=
=20
lives in Berkeley. He is considered among the top tier of bankruptcy expert=
s=20
in the United States.=20
?????He will be calling the shots in one of the largest bankruptcy=20
reorganizations in U.S. history. The case raises unprecedented legal=20
questions and is expected to make new law. Some of the legal disputes may=
=20
wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court, attorneys said.
?????Lawyers who know the easygoing, witty judge say he is probably relishi=
ng=20
this legal challenge the way a golfer looks forward to playing a new and mo=
re=20
difficult course. The court action begins today, when Montali is expected t=
o=20
decide whether PG&E can spend cash that others have laid claims to.=20
?????Right from the beginning, Montali will be in the limelight, and lawyer=
s=20
will be eagerly searching for any clues to his leanings. Montali declined t=
o=20
be interviewed, but those who know him say he is fair, smart, hard-working=
=20
and thoughtful. He does not browbeat, but quietly negotiates to bring peopl=
e=20
around, lawyers said.
?????The judge is highly engaged in his cases. He is well prepared,=20
intellectually curious and knows the hard questions to ask, lawyers said. H=
e=20
also is a relatively quick decision-maker, frequently ruling from the bench=
.
?????"Reality tends to come out" in his courtroom because Montali does not=
=20
allow lawyers to evade his questions, Engel said.
?????There are few precedents to guide Montali in many of the novel legal=
=20
questions he is likely to be asked to rule upon. Can he order electricity=
=20
rate hikes? The law is unclear. Can he force energy suppliers to hold down=
=20
their prices? Doubtful, bankruptcy lawyers said. Can he force PG&E's parent=
=20
company to cough up some money? Possibly. Can he force PG&E to sell off=20
assets? Yes, but probably not in the near term.
?????"This is going to be one of these cases where the envelope is going to=
=20
be pushed, and I think there is a danger in making any categorical statemen=
ts=20
right now," said a bankruptcy lawyer who is involved in the case.
?????PG&E's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization will be enormously complex=
=20
legally, lawyers said. Montali will have to reconcile state utility law and=
=20
federal energy law with bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy judges have broad=20
discretion to decide disputes, and Montali will control PG&E's purse string=
s.
?????Lawyers who know Montali well say he is savvy about using the Internet=
=20
to communicate court information, masters arcane legal subjects quickly, an=
d=20
probably is thrilled to be making the calls in a case that will be watched=
=20
nationally.
?????Some people go on the bench to retire. Montali went on in 1993 to have=
=20
more fun intellectually, lawyers said.
?????Montali "tends to be very constructive," said another lawyer who asked=
=20
not to be identified by name because he may represent a creditor in the PG&=
E=20
case. "He wants his cases to go somewhere, and he tries to encourage people=
=20
to make progress."
?????Before he was appointed to the bench, Montali had practiced bankruptcy=
=20
law for more than two decades. He began representing debtors but was doing=
=20
primarily creditor work in his last law firm job with the city's venerable=
=20
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro.
?????The bankruptcy bar he was a part of is relatively small, and the lawye=
rs=20
who practice it know one another. Several lawyers interviewed about Montali=
=20
referred to him by his first name.
?????Because these lawyers are likely to be players together in many cases=
=20
over the years, trustworthiness is important, bankruptcy attorneys said.=20
Effectiveness requires that other members of the bar trust your word and=20
credibility.
?????The practice also requires knowledge of economics and economic terms,=
=20
ease both with deal making and trial work, and above all else, practicality=
,=20
lawyers said.
?????Whereas a business litigator may know exactly what he or she will be=
=20
doing two months from now, bankruptcy lawyers tend to operate on tight=20
deadlines with little notice. Many of these lawyers were at their desks ove=
r=20
the weekend preparing for the PG&E case.
?????"There is no one in town who is not part of this case," said Engel, wh=
o=20
is representing a municipal utility. "Everyone is involved."
?????Montali is tall, lanky and balding. His trademark is his handlebar=20
mustache, which he has worn for decades and which reflects his gregariousne=
ss=20
and humor, other lawyers said. He cooks Italian food expertly and likes to=
=20
sail around San Francisco Bay and walk his dog during his time away from=20
work. His wife, Mary, is in the real estate business, and they have three=
=20
grown daughters.
?????As a lawyer, Montali was masterful at bringing about a compromise in t=

bankruptcy of a major agricultural cooperative a decade ago, Engels said. A=
t=20
the time the co-op went bankrupt, farmers had picked their crops, but there=
=20
was no money to operate the canneries and no money to pay the growers.=20
Montali was representing a bank in the case.
?????"We could have had a disaster," Engel said. "Literally, imagine if 5,0=

farmers lost their entire crop because there was nobody to take it. Each of=
=20
them would have gone into bankruptcy."
?????The parties locked themselves together in one place for a week and hal=

Montali was "at the core of it," Engel said. He persuaded all parties to=20
agree to a plan that involved selling the cooperative. "He would take someo=

work if they persisted that way," Engel said.
?????"He is the ultimate reasonable man who convinced them that this path i=
s=20
the one they needed to be on in their own self-interest."
?????Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer, said Montali has=20
"tremendous integrity." As a lawyer, he was cogent and forceful in argument=

and would make simple, clear statements that would cause everyone in the=20

?????QUINCY, Calif.--The PG&E bankruptcy protection filing Friday came only=
=20
four days before the state's largest utility is to make $80 million in=20
property tax payments to 49 California counties.
?????In Northern California's remote Plumas County, this was especially bad=
=20
news. Because of its large hydroelectric holdings, Pacific Gas & Electric i=
s=20
Plumas' largest taxpayer, accounting for about 18% of the county's=20
$2.3-billion tax base.
?????Bankruptcy laws usually require that government obligations, including=
=20
taxes, be paid first. But the uncertainty over financially crippled PG&E's=
=20
ability to pay sent tremors through government offices in the High Sierra=
=20
county south of Mt. Lassen.
?????"If we took a hit like that, we were probably looking at job layoffs a=
nd=20
program curtailments," said County Assessor Chuck Leonhardt. He said things=
=20
ranging from library books to police salaries could be affected.
?????The state's two biggest private utilities, PG&E and Southern Californi=

Edison, annually pay more than a quarter-billion dollars in property taxes,=
=20
including $70 million levied on Edison by Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside an=

the Tuesday property tax deadline.
?????The biggest impact of unpaid taxes falls on the state, which is legall=
y=20
required to supply most uncollected money that is for schools--which is mos=
t=20
of the property tax load. In smaller, rural counties like Plumas, which has=
 a=20
permanent population of only 22,000, a utility tax default would seriously=
=20
reduce funding for other local services. PG&E pays Plumas almost $4 million=
 a=20
year in taxes.
?????A large county that could be seriously hurt by a PG&E default is San=
=20
Luis Obispo on the central coast, where the utility's Diablo Canyon nuclear=
=20
plant generates $28 million in property taxes, about 15% of the county's ta=
x=20
revenue.
?????"This is not catastrophic for us, but it is significant," said county=
=20
Auditor-Controller Gere Sibbach. Sibbach said one large school district, Sa=
n=20
Luis Coastal, could come up $2 million short as a result of a PG&E default.
?????"That school district gets $10 million in taxes from PG&E," Sibbach=20
said, "but the state will only backfill for $8 million, so they would have =

cut programs if PG&E doesn't pay."
?????Plumas County faces a double threat in the PG&E bankruptcy filing.
?????Here, beautiful Lake Almanor and other hydroelectric reservoirs are=20
strung along the north fork of the cascading Feather River. The "PG&E lakes=
,"=20
as the reservoirs are known here, are what attract retirees and=20
tourists--mainstays of the fragile local economy since the timber industry=
=20
went into decline.
?????The landscape here is rich in broad, green valleys and more than 100=

lakes. In addition to boating and fishing, the county has 10 golf=20
courses--one for each 2,200 residents.
?????Because hydroelectricity is at such a premium this year, the utility i=
s=20
expected to suck all the water it can from Lake Almanor and nearby Bucks=20
Lake, bringing potential ruin to the area's tourism and recreation industry=
.
?????"They are probably going to draw every drop of water out of the lake=
=20
they can," said Marvin Alexander, one of the retirees who lives on Lake=20
Almanor. "The boat ramps won't even reach the water."
?????The equation here is simple: When lake levels fall too low, the fish=
=20
don't bite, the tourists don't come and the property values decline.=20
According to real estate agent Tim O'Brien, Lake Almanor homes have sold in=
=20
recent years for $500,000 to $1 million.
?????These days the housing market is slow. "This community basically lives=
=20
and dies by the lake levels," explained Chris Luna, a Chester civil enginee=
r=20
and home builder.
?????The energy crisis is disrupting what had become a comfortable=20
relationship in recent years. For most of the last decade, Plumas County=20
homeowners and businesses have evolved a modus vivendi with PG&E.
?????With electricity in good supply, PG&E officials kept the lake high in=

July to keep boaters and fishermen happy. Residents agreed not to make too=

?????PG&E spokeswoman Lisa Randle would not say how much water the utility =

ominous sign when the Buck's Creek Power House recently began gushing water=

from its four big turbine discharge gates late every afternoon during peak=

The power is produced by the force of water that falls through pipes 2,500=

Generators Scrambled to End Pacts With Utilities=20

Energy: Even before PG&E filed for bankruptcy, alternative plant owners who=
=20
hadn't been paid in months pursued court actions.=20

By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--In filing for federal bankruptcy protection last week,=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. determined what other power producers had alread=
y=20
concluded: The state had failed to solve their payment problems and the tim=
e=20
had come for the courts to step in.
?????In the days leading up to PG&E's Bankruptcy Court petition, a growing=
=20
number of alternative energy producers had also been filing lawsuits, seeki=
ng=20
to be freed from their contracts with PG&E and Southern California Edison.=
=20
The litigation was triggered in part by a controversial new rate plan impos=
ed=20
last month by the state Public Utilities Commission in addition to millions=
=20
of dollars of debt owed to the producers by the utilities.
?????On Tuesday, Dynamis Inc. filed suit in Fresno, saying PG&E owes it $3=
=20
million.
?????Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Co., one of the state's largest=20
alternative energy producers, also had filed suit to have its contract with=
=20
Edison suspended. So did Delta Power, which owns five small gas-fired plant=
s=20
in California. Both producers are owed tens of millions by Edison.
?????At least a dozen such suits have been filed in civil courts, and lawye=
rs=20
warn that more could be on the way.
?????"Tough solutions were not being brought to the equation, which left PG=
&E=20
and others feeling they were better off in the court system," said Jerry=20
Bloom, an attorney for the California Cogeneration Council.
?????The court actions come on the heels of an order by the PUC last month=
=20
that Edison and PG&E begin fully paying hundreds of small alternative energ=
y=20
producers. But some producers say that a new rate plan issued by the PUC=20
would force them to operate at a loss and that nothing has been done to=20
address the about $1.5 billion owed to members of the group by PG&E and=20
Edison.
?????Lawyers say other producers have served Edison with notices that they=
=20
plan to cancel their contracts.
?????Gas-fired generators account for about two-thirds of the electricity=
=20
produced by the alternative energy group.
?????The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's powe=
r=20
grid, reports that there continues to be a roughly 3,000-megawatt reduction=
=20
in output from the alternative energy producers. The daily sum is enough=20
power to supply 2 million to 3 million typical homes.
?????"It clearly shows the problem hasn't been fixed," said Jan Smutny-Jone=
s,=20
executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
?????California is home to nearly 700 producers of alternative and renewabl=
e=20
energy, which as a group provide more than a quarter of the electricity use=
d=20
by consumers.
?????Some of the producers have gone offline or reduced supplies for=20
maintenance reasons, but others have cut back because they have not been pa=
id=20
by Edison since November or have received only partial payments from PG&E.
?????The drop in output has at times forced the state to purchase replaceme=
nt=20
supplies on the pricey spot market for electricity and contributed to rolli=
ng=20
blackouts last month. The latter event prompted Gov. Gray Davis to propose =
a=20
plan to get the generators up and running again.
?????Consequently, the PUC established a new rate plan for the producers an=
d=20
ordered the utilities to begin fully paying them beginning this month. The=
=20
payment goal would be accomplished in part by slashing the rates that PG&E=
=20
and Edison must pay the producers.
?????But the PUC action appears to have compelled a growing number of=20
gas-fired generators to file lawsuits in an effort to be released from thei=
r=20
contracts with the utilities and be paid the millions they are owed.
?????Bloom contends that the new rate plan will force some producers to=20
operate at a loss because it does not adequately compensate for their gas=
=20
expenses. He said he expects generators to challenge the plan in court or=
=20
before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
?????Smutny-Jones contends that the plan wrongly assumes that all natural g=
as=20
used by his members can be piped in from the Oregon border, where the price=
=20
of natural gas is cheaper. The producers, he added, are seeking assurances=
=20
that they will be paid realistic rates by the utilities for future deliveri=
es.
?????Utilities are scheduled to pay the first round of reduced rates, as=20
ordered by the PUC, early next week. Both utilities have indicated that the=
y=20
plan to make the first round of payments.
?????Edison officials said Friday they have been served with 10 producer=20
lawsuits. They say they fear that if the generators are let out of their=20
contracts, they could sell their supplies out of state, which could in turn=
=20
cause rates to rise for California consumers because it would reduce supply=
.
?????PG&E spokesman John Nelson said in an interview last week before the=
=20
bankruptcy filing that PG&E has been served with two such lawsuits. He said=
=20
his company is also concerned about the PUC rate plan and whether it truly=
=20
lowered the rates PG&E must pay the alternative producers and whether there=
=20
would be enough money in the rates paid by customers to turn around and pay=
=20
the producers.
?????"We're concerned that the commission decision does not solve the=20
problem," Nelson said.
?????A Davis spokesman said last week that the administration is still=20
working on the issue of money owed to the producers and that the=20
administration is continuing to work with the PUC to get more generators ba=
ck=20
online.
?????Observers believe the number of producer lawsuits will grow because mo=
st=20
cases to date have been aimed at Edison. The utility has not paid its=20
producers since November and has fought to have its rates slashed.
?????By comparison, PG&E has made efforts to partially pay its producers in=
=20
recent months and to keep them informed of their financial situation.
?????A Bankruptcy Court is expected to decide whether to affirm the contrac=
ts=20
of producers who sell to PG&E or to free them to sell their power elsewhere=
.
?????An Imperial County judge has already freed CalEnergy, a small geotherm=
al=20
producer, from its contract with Edison because of Edison's failure to pay=
=20
the company. The court has delayed ruling on CalEnergy's request for $99=20
million in back payments until April 16--the day the utility is expected to=
=20
begin paying its alternative generators.
?????Since it quit transmitting 270 megawatts to Edison last month, CalEner=
gy=20
has been selling its electricity to El Paso Energy, a marketing company tha=
t=20
resells power on the spot market. If other generators are able to repeat th=

PG&E Gave Bonuses Prior to Bankruptcy=20

By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer


????? SAN FRANCISCO--In the days approaching Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s=
=20
bankruptcy filing, the debt-ridden utility had more than $2.5 billion in ca=
sh=20
on hand and was restarting services suspended earlier this year because of=
=20
its shaky finances.
?????Then, the day before the filing, the utility awarded 6,000 managers an=
d=20
other employees more than $50 million in annual bonuses and announced that=
=20
long-delayed merit increases had kicked in for the same workers.
?????The timing of the bonus payments in particular raised an outcry from=
=20
consumer groups and state officials.
?????"Management is suffering from two afflictions: Denial and greed," Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis said in a statement.
?????"It does not look good," said state Senate President Pro Tem John=20
Burton. "They [already] have a business and a P.R. problem."
?????The bonuses and raises were announced in an e-mail sent Thursday by=20
Chief Executive Robert Glynn to employees. The payments cover about a third=
=20
of the company's 19,000 workers, ranging from nonunion clerical staff to al=
l=20
but the very top management.
?????On Friday, hours after PG&E had filed for reorganization of its debts=
=20
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws, a San Francisco judge approved the=20
company's overall employee compensation plan. But PG&E officials said the=
=20
ruling did not specifically cover the bonuses or merit raises.
?????Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consum=
er=20
Rights, said the bonuses should not be allowed.
?????"Talk about manipulating the corporate finances to benefit management=
=20
prior to bankruptcy," he said. "It is the kind of arrogant mismanagement th=
at=20
is responsible for the ruin of this company."
?????Richard Levin, a Los Angeles bankruptcy attorney, said such payments t=
o=20
employees are not unusual, especially after the filing of bankruptcy.
?????"A company trying to reorganize has to take pretty strong action to ke=
ep=20
employees," he said. "If they did not do it, who is going to keep the=20
electricity flowing?"
?????PG&E, the state's largest utility, declared in its filing for bankrupt=
cy=20
protection that it is more than $9 billion in debt--several times more than=
=20
cash on hand--and was getting nowhere in negotiations with the governor for=
=20
state purchase of its power lines and other assets. The filing, which=20
includes a list of creditors, allows the company to continue to operate whi=
le=20
it reorganizes its financial affairs. A judge, working under federal=20
bankruptcy law, will determine who will be paid and in what order. The firs=
t=20
hearing is scheduled for Monday.
?????Company officials defended the payments, which were reported in=20
Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle, and fired back at Davis. "Instead of=20
focusing all his attention on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worseni=
ng=20
energy crisis, the governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our=20
company," PG&E said in a statement Saturday.
?????The payments, officials said, are awarded each year to employees who=
=20
meet the company's performance goals and objectives. "They are smaller this=
=20
year because of the larger financial crisis the company is going through bu=
t,=20
it is safe to say, more deserved this year than in years past because of th=
e=20
challenges facing our employees this year," said PG&E spokesman John Nelson=
.
?????The payments came after the company began reversing some of the=20
cost-cutting measures imposed early this year after its finances worsened,=
=20
PG&E officials said.

?????PUC Orders End to Some Cutbacks
?????Among other things, PG&E had suspended projects involving the=20
underground placement of power lines, prompting cities and residents to=20
protest to state regulators. The company also eliminated about 325 jobs=20
earlier this year and was planning layoffs of almost 700 more. But the=20
California Public Utilities Commission last month blocked the layoffs and=
=20
ordered the company to rescind any cutbacks affecting service.
?????Company officials said that, thanks in part to a tax refund of $1.1=20
billion, the company now has about $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion on hand.
?????"We are now in a position to start relaxing some of those=20
cash-conservation measures," Nelson said Saturday. "About a week ago we=20
started doing undergrounding again and [performing] new installations of=20
electrical service" in business parks and elsewhere.
?????"This compensation package was one of those measures reinstated," he=
=20
said.
?????Officials said the payments exempted the company's 25 officers, as wel=
l=20
as about 12,000 union workers who received raises in January.
?????They said the total of the bonuses, estimated roughly at more than $50=
=20
million, is substantially lower than the $83 million in payments suspended =
in=20
January when the utility announced cost-cutting measures.
?????That $83 million included bonuses for employee performance and a bonus=
=20
based on the company's success.
?????"As we close the books for 2000, we have determined that we are unable=

to make [that] portion of the incentive payment due to the negative financi=
al=20
impact of the ongoing California energy crisis," CEO Glynn said in his e-ma=

?????He said the incentive bonuses were awarded along with merit increases=

averaging 3% for all employees, effective April 1. Bonuses commonly are abo=

and other factors.
?????Mike Florio, senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network, said, "Tha=

that the 25 [top executives] are not included. Those are the people that ha=

?????On Saturday, Davis administration negotiators redoubled efforts to kee=

NEWS ANALYSIS=20
Shifting Action to Neutral Arena May Be Bankruptcy Filing's Upside=20

Court might be a forum in which the state, PG&E and creditors could break=
=20
impasses. But there are many uncertainties.=20

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer


?????By forcing almost all the deadlocked parties in California's energy=20
crisis to meet in a neutral public forum, the bankruptcy filing by Pacific=
=20
Gas & Electric Co. on Friday may actually help clear the path to a solution=
,=20
some experts say.
?????But along that path lie numerous uncertainties, including questions=20
about the powers of the Bankruptcy Court that have never been resolved in=
=20
practice. Among the most serious booby-traps confronting PG&E is that its=
=20
financial books will be placed under a microscope.
?????"When you initiate a bankruptcy," said Daniel J. Bussel, a bankruptcy=
=20
specialist at UCLA School of Law, "you don't have compete control over what=
=20
happens."
?????The bankruptcy filing removes many of the thorniest questions revolvin=
g=20
around the energy crisis from an arena that has been hard-pressed to deal=
=20
with them: the political. Because utility policy is important to so many=20
constituencies--including taxpayers, ratepayers, consumer activists,=20
regulators, and legislators--solving the crisis in a way that is not only=
=20
equitable but meets everyone's political goals has been a daunting task.
?????That is especially so because the crisis actually encompasses two=20
separate problems. One is how to restructure the state's energy program so=
=20
that deregulation can be made to work and costs and rates can be brought in=
to=20
line; the second is what to do about the billions in debt PG&E and Southern=
=20
California Edison accrued last year from the purchase of wholesale power at=
=20
prices higher than they were permitted to pass on to customers.=20
?????The attempt to settle both issues in concert has confounded the state'=
s=20
leaders--especially since the question of whether the state should bail the=
=20
utilities out of their debts at all is itself a contentious one.
?????"I've thought for quite some time that our primary focus ought to be o=
n=20
how you solve the [long-term] problem, as opposed to how you adjudicate a=
=20
dispute between the utilities and the generators," said state Treasurer Phi=
l=20
Angelides in an interview. "Too much time in Sacramento is being spent tryi=
ng=20
to figure out how to ransom the generators' bill. In some ways, the=20
[bankruptcy] filing takes those past debts off the table."
?????Angelides said the court might represent a forum where the state, the=
=20
utility and its creditors could examine and challenge those generators'=20
bills. That is something that federal regulators, who have jurisdiction ove=
r=20
wholesale power rates, have been loath to do, despite complaints from PG&E=
=20
and Edison that they have been overcharged billions by profiteering power=
=20
plant owners.
?????There is no question that the filing does complicate matters for many=
=20
participants in the drama over California's energy supply.
?????PG&E's filing, in which it sought protection from creditors under=20
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, could place more pressure on=20
Southern California Edison, the state's second cash-strapped utility, to=20
enter bankruptcy as well. That's because electricity generators will be mor=
e=20
assured of getting paid for their post-bankruptcy sales to PG&E, for which=
=20
all pre-bankruptcy debts are temporarily in abeyance. By contrast, Edison=
=20
creditors have no guarantees that the utility will be able to pay them.=20
Edison executives said Friday they had no plans to file for bankruptcy=20
protection.
?????On the other hand, it might also inspire Gov. Gray Davis to rapidly=20
reach a bailout agreement with Edison, as though to prove that PG&E's move=
=20
was unnecessary or premature. Davis has been hinting that a deal is near. T=
he=20
state would buy Edison's electric transmission grid, providing the utility=
=20
with desperately needed cash, but there have been few public signs of=20
progress. PG&E had been balking at such a resolution.
?????Among the most serious perils of the bankruptcy filing are those facin=
g=20
PG&E itself. Although company executives clearly hope to limit the Bankrupt=
cy=20
Court's jurisdiction to the utility alone, that may not be possible, expert=
s=20
say. It is likely that the utility's creditors will insist on examining its=
=20
controversial relationship with its holding company, PG&E Corp.--a scrutiny=
=20
that might drive that company into bankruptcy too.
?????Although PG&E had long threatened to resort to bankruptcy, the=20
abruptness of the utility's filing at 9:04 a.m. Friday took aback almost=20
everybody involved with the energy crisis, coming as it did less than 15=20
hours after Davis delivered a statewide television and radio address=20
proposing a program to bring rates into line with wholesale energy costs.
?????Even normally well-connected professionals were caught short. The=20
research department of the investment bank Goldman Sachs told clients Frida=
y=20
morning that PG&E and Edison were on the way to a "return . . . to financia=
l=20
health" and hinted their parent companies' shares were poised to more than=
=20
double in price. The research report was released Friday by Davis' office.
?????Instead, PG&E filed for bankruptcy. By the end of the day both compani=
es=20
had lost more than 35% of their value.
?????By giving PG&E's creditors legal standing to directly scrutinize its=
=20
finances, the filing leaves the utility's recent business decisions open to=
=20
challenge.
?????Chief among these is the utility's record of "upstreaming" to its pare=
nt=20
revenues it received from ratepayers in the first two and a half years of=
=20
deregulation. Critics have argued that those payments left the utility=20
starved for cash when wholesale rates soared beginning in May 2000.
?????In announcing the bankruptcy filing Friday, PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn=
=20
laid nearly all the blame for his company's perilous condition at the feet =
of=20
the Public Utilities Commission, the governor and other state officials.
?????The company had been "raising the crisis flag [about high wholesale=20
power prices] since last summer," he said.
?????Yet an independent audit of PG&E commissioned by the PUC and released =
in=20
January documented that the utility did not implement any cash conservation=
=20
measures until December. The utility even paid a cash dividend to its paren=
t=20
company for the third quarter of 2000, covering the months of July through=
=20
September, of more than $200 million.
?????In all, PUC documents show, Pacific Gas & Electric disbursed $9.6=20
billion to PG&E Corp. from January 1998 through September 2000. That money=
=20
benefited shareholders, from whom some $2.8 billion in shares were=20
repurchased and who received another $1.5 billion in dividends; and=20
bondholders, for whom $2.8 billion in debt was paid off.=20
?????Glynn insisted Friday that the company has "assiduously complied" with=
=20
PUC rules governing the relationship between the utility and the holding=20
company. But creditors are sure to give the transactions another look.
?????"Those transactions will now certainly be scrutinized," said Bussel.=
=20
Bankruptcy court represents "a forum to bring a lawsuit to unwind those=20
transactions and get a full airing of circumstances of the transfers."

?????Filing Could Threaten Parent Company
?????While PG&E executives took pains to note that the holding company and=
=20
its unregulated subsidiaries are not subject to the bankruptcy filing,=20
experts say that could change if Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali is persuad=
ed=20
that the transactions were improper and the money should be returned to the=
=20
utility.
?????"There will be a lot of sophisticated lawyers looking at this," Bussel=
=20
said. "If distributions to the parent are deemed fraudulent transfers and a=
re=20
voidable, the holding company would have a huge liability and would probabl=
y=20
have to file" for bankruptcy.
?????A broader threat to PG&E and the state's energy future is that state=
=20
regulators and Montali might be unable to agree on the rates to be charged =
by=20
the utility. A provision of the bankruptcy law requires that any rates that=
=20
are part of a recovery plan for a regulated utility must be approved by tha=
t=20
utility's regulators.
?????Although that provision would leave rate-setting authority in the hand=
s=20
of the California PUC, in practice the the commission will have to negotiat=
e=20
with the judge. Any failure of those negotiations would raise issues that=

Use Eminent Domain as a Power Tool=20
By MICHAEL J. AGUIRRE

?????Gov. Gray Davis should follow Pacific Gas & Electric's example and adm=
it=20
that his electricity program is also bankrupt. The governor's primary=20
objective was to keep the utilities from bankruptcy. He has failed. He shou=
ld=20
admit his failure and reformulate his policy. Whatever he does must be base=
d=20
on a clear understanding of the problem.=20
?????The people of California have a right to buy electricity at fair price=
s.=20
Producers of electricity are entitled to a fair return on their investment.=
=20
Before 1998, a balance between these two points was struck by the Public=20
Utilities Commission using cost-of-service pricing. Utilities presented the=
ir=20
production bills, the PUC reviewed them, determined a reasonable rate of=20
return and set a rate high enough to cover both. California became the seco=
nd=20
most efficient user of electricity in the country under this system, and it=
s=20
utilities prospered.=20
?????In 1996, the electric power industry, with promises of lower prices,=
=20
induced Gov. Pete Wilson, the PUC and the Legislature to reduce the=20
commission's power to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices. Under=
=20
the power industry's system competition, not regulation, would set prices,=
=20
and prices would go down. PG&E head Robert Glynn represented it to be a "hu=
ge=20
opportunity for consumers to lower their energy costs." PG&E, San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric and Southern California Edison, with PUC approval, then sold=20
California's most significant generation plants, its gas-fired units, to fi=
ve=20
multinational corporations.=20
?????These five companies led the onslaught on California consumers, raisin=
g=20
electricity prices from $7 billion in 1999 to a projected $70 billion in=20
2001. California authorities have determined that 98% of the price bids=20
submitted by these five companies--some 25,000--were based on monopoly, not=
=20
competitive, pricing. Gov. Davis is right: "California's deregulation schem=
e=20
is a colossal and dangerous failure."=20
?????No one--not Wilson, the PUC or the Legislature--provided an exit=20
strategy if deregulation did not work. Davis has been unable or unwilling t=
o=20
come up with one. He failed to get on top of the problem when he took offic=
e,=20
despite clear warning signs. He failed to see that he cannot finance ever=
=20
higher prices with public funds, and he lacks the resolve to do what he mus=
t=20
to stop them. His one effort to use tax funds to keep the utilities out of=
=20
formal bankruptcy has failed, with PG&E's filing for Chapter 11 last week.=
=20
?????There are no good choices now. However, we cannot continue down the ro=
ad=20
Davis has chosen. It leads to financial ruin. We cannot rely on private=20
companies building new generation plants because the same price gougers wil=
l=20
control how the new electricity gets priced. We cannot rely on the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission or President Bush. California can only rely on=
=20
California to solve this problem.=20
?????As a first step, Gov. Davis should do what he threatened to do in his=
=20
State of the State address: use the power of eminent domain to recover the=
=20
gas-fired generation plants that the price manipulators are using to set=20
monopoly prices. He can pay "just compensation" to the owners but not one=
=20
dime more.=20
?????The governor should now recognize California's vital interest in=20
protecting itself from these prices. Eminent domain is a reasonable tool to=
=20
use to achieve that goal. It has been used in less compelling circumstances=
.=20
For example, eminent domain was used in the early 1980s for George W. Bush'=
s=20
investment team to assemble the land on which the Texas Rangers' stadium is=
=20
built, from which he and his partners profited handsomely. If eminent domai=
n=20
can be used for private profit, it can be used to protect the vital interes=
ts=20
of the state of California. The plants should be divested to private=20
ownership, but only to companies that are under PUC jurisdiction.=20
?????The PUC also should be used to plan how California can move forward to=
=20
an improved cost-based system of regulation. What we cannot do is to contin=
ue=20
on with the current plan, which is to have the governor set electricity=20
prices behind closed doors, working with the very people who are suspected =
of=20
unlawful price fixing. PG&E's bankruptcy provides the governor with a new=
=20
opportunity to move to a more effective program.=20
?????The governor should now stop using public funds to buy electricity. He=
=20
should urge Edison to join PG&E in reorganizing under bankruptcy court=20
protection. This will allow all parties to contest the unpaid billions of=
=20
dollars of receivables owed to the power producers and their associates. Th=
is=20
will send a message to Wall Street to stop funding such outrageous and=20
predatory practices because they don't pay.=20
?????The state attorney general should conduct a criminal grand jury=20
investigation into the alleged wrongdoing by the power generators. He shoul=
d=20
also join in the private litigation that asserts that the power producers=
=20
violated the state's antitrust laws. He should follow the investigative tra=
il=20
to Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta and wherever else it leads.=20
?????Finally, Californians are going to have to make a short-term sacrifice=
=20
to get a long-term gain. The governor's call last week for conservation doe=
s=20
not go far enough. Each city council and mayor and all boards of supervisor=
s=20
should be required to come up with an emergency conservation plan. We need =
to=20
cut consumption to the point where we can meet it with current supply. We=
=20
cannot put an unfair burden on business because this will cost jobs. People=
=20
with lower incomes and fixed incomes need to be protected.=20
?????PG&E's bankruptcy filing removes the foundation of the governor's plan=
.=20
He should remember the example of FDR, who likened himself to a football=20
quarterback who tries one play and, if it did not work, then tries another.=

Governor, Utility In War Of Words=20

California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and=
=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the=20
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility.=20
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral hi=
gh=20
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith.=20
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews =
in=20
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million i=
n=20
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy=
=20
filing.=20
"PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"=20
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night.=20
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that "instead of focusing all his attentio=
n=20
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the=20
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."=20
PG&E said Davis was criticizing "thousands of men and women who have worked=
=20
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis" and concluded that=20
"California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention=
=20
to the crisis at hand."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: "PG&E=
=20
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to=
=20
blame, they should look in the mirror."=20
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accor=
d=20
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash-=20
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion.=20
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night.=20
"There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty=20
close," Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come a=
s=20
early as today.=20
"The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"=
=20
he said.=20
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy=20
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E=
's=20
bankruptcy bombshell.=20
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly=
=20
have become much more complex.=20
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect=
=20
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn=
't=20
really change a thing.=20
Consider:=20
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility=
=20
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate=20
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place.=20
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not=20
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptc=
y=20
does nothing to affect that precarious situation.=20
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that=20
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers stil=
l=20
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer.=20
"The crux of the problem is still the same," said Loretta Lynch, president =
of=20
the state Public Utilities Commission. "We face the same challenges we did=
=20
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."=20
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy "increases the uncertainty."=20
The utility doesn't see it that way.=20
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain=
=20
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis t=
o=20
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles.=20
"California remains in an energy crisis," he said. "As we head toward summe=
r,=20
resources are going to be very tight."=20
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy=20
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company=
's=20
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills.=
=20
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will=
=20
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting t=
he=20
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses=
=20
must be borne by consumers.=20
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is=20
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing=
=20
fees,=20
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total co=
st=20
over a number of years.=20
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various=20
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on.=
=20
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished,=
=20
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court.=20
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the=20
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility --=20
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to =
be=20
determined.=20
"Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra=
=20
and not PG&E?" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San=20
Francisco. "I don't know the answer to that."=20
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concern=
s=20
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy=20
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was=20
unveiled.=20
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to=
=20
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior compa=
ny=20
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on=20
solving California's energy issues.=20
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal wi=
th=20
Edison was expected at any time, observers said.=20
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&=
E=20
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, "they=
=20
would be seen as a spoiler."=20
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for=
=20
footing in the changed political landscape.=20
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political a=
nd=20
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy.=20
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San=20
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that=20
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer.=20
"These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the=
=20
public," she said.=20

Power Grab -- Some Democrats Favor Seizing Plants=20

N122655.DTL=20
With the prospect that state power buyers could burn through more than $2=
=20
billion a month this summer, some state Democratic leaders are pushing for =
a=20
takeover of private power plants to get soaring prices under control.=20
Lawmakers concede that sending state agents to grab the keys of power=20
generating plants would be an extraordinary measure.=20
But now that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has limited the state's options=
=20
with Friday's bankruptcy filing and with little hope for stronger federal=
=20
price controls, state Senate leader John Burton and others say seizing powe=
r=20
plants makes financial and political sense.=20
They say they've done the math: Since January, California has spent more th=
an=20
$4 billion buying power. That's about $1 billion more than private energy=
=20
firms paid for the power plants PG&E and California's two other=20
investor-owned utilities were=20
forced to sell under California's botched deregulation plan. At those rates=
,=20
California could soon look like a renter paying the full value of the house=
=20
several times a year.=20
Profits of 300 percent are not uncommon for large private generators, which=
=20
provide about 40 percent of the state's power needs. The state could seize=
=20
the assets, compensate the companies and then sell the electricity to=20
consumers at cost, advocates of the plan say.=20
"We have to do something," said Burton, D-San Francisco, one of a group of=
=20
legislators who urged Davis at a meeting last week to condemn some of the=
=20
plants. "These people have got us by the throat. They're making more money=
=20
than God, and we've got to fight back -- not with words, but with actions."=
=20
Davis himself raised the specter of using his emergency powers to take over=
=20
power plants with a fiery flourish during his State of the State address=20
earlier this year.=20
"If I have to use the power of eminent domain to prevent generators from=20
driving consumers into the dark and utilities into bankruptcy, then that's=
=20
what I will do," he said in January.=20
Davis still hasn't ruled out the possibility, but he says it's not high on=
=20
his list of tactics.=20
Generators say they would fight tooth and nail against such a grab, and sta=
te=20
GOP lawmakers oppose condemnation, saying it smacks of underdeveloped=20
countries' nationalizing key industries.=20
But Burton and other Democrats, including state Senators Don Perata, D-=20
Oakland, and Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, say the governor's strategy so=
=20
far has left giant energy firms holding all the cards -- and a mounting pil=
e=20
of the state's cash.=20
Davis had been trying to restore the financial stability of PG&E and Southe=
rn=20
California Edison after their combined $14 billion debt for electricity=20
purchases so damaged their creditworthiness that the state had to take over=
=20
buying power.=20
But now that PG&E has sought bankruptcy protection rather than accept Davis=
'=20
plan to buy its transmission lines, the state may be stuck with the role of=
=20
power buyer for years.=20
POWERS OF EMINENT DOMAIN
Sacramento lawyer Richard Desmond, an expert on state powers of eminent=20
domain, said California could seize generating plants by demonstrating that=
=20
it would put the properties to "a higher and more necessary use."=20
"The government has almost unlimited power of eminent domain to acquire=20
property," Desmond said. "The only thing the state has to do is pay 'just=
=20
compensation,' as defined under the constitution."=20
The state could file a formal suit for eminent domain, a time-consuming=20
procedure if the owner mounts a fierce resistance over the transfer price,=
=20
Desmond said. If the state wants to take immediate possession, it can depos=
it=20
an estimate of the just compensation and fight it out later in court. But i=
f=20
the state loses, it could be stuck for interest, litigation costs and=20
damages.=20
Condemnation of power plants would raise a number of unknowns, such as=20
figuring out who would manage and operate the facilities. The state might=
=20
also be put into the position of having to seize contracts between the=20
generators and natural gas providers.=20
Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said the governor's first priority was buildi=
ng=20
new plants to increase supply, rather than condemning existing plants.=20
State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, said he thought seizing plants was a=
=20
horrible idea.=20
"We would become a third world country and start nationalizing things,"=20
Battin said. "Nobody would ever build a power plant in California again. I=
=20
think that would be a really bad play."=20
COMPANY WOULD FIGHT
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company would fight=20
vigorously to protect its multimillion-dollar investment in four California=
=20
plants, including Morro Bay and Moss Landing.=20
"We would defend our interest and seek a fair market value," Williams said.=
=20
Duke spent $611 million to buy or lease the four plants since 1998, and has=
=20
embarked on a $1.6 billion program to upgrade and expand them.=20
Some power companies, however, may find their claims for the fair market=20
value of their plants undercut by their own tax filings. Energy firms,=20
including Duke, told county assessors last year that the utility plants the=
y=20
bought were worth hundreds of millions of dollars less than they paid for=
=20
them.=20
Private companies including Duke, Dynegy, Southern Energy, AES Corp and=20
Calpine spent a total of $3.2 billion to buy divested utility power plants=
=20
that can produce as much as 20,000 megawatts.=20
UNDERLYING PROBLEM UNSOLVED
Williams said taking over the property of private companies would not solve=
=20
the underlying problem behind California's high energy prices: rising deman=
d=20
and an inadequate supply of energy to fill it.=20
Even if Davis seized only one plant, the move might spur other power=20
generators to drop their prices, said Doug Heller of the Foundation for=20
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.=20
"As soon as the generators recognize we're ready to go to a public power=20
system and take their plants, they may start selling power at reasonable=20
rates,=20
and we won't have to go down that road," Heller said.=20

This is Gray Davis' last chance. He can be remembered for something other=

PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn slapped Davis and all Californians in the=

his company "immoral."=20
So he went out and proved he wasn't immoral by giving bonuses to 6,000=20

.=20
Glynn probably considers that loyalty. But unlike many of the great men who=
=20
guided PG&E in the past, he has shown no loyalty to California or its=20
citizens.=20
Compare Glynn's behavior with that of Frank G. Drum, who was president of=
=20
PG&E during the company's great financial crisis of 1907, when San Francisc=
o=20
was in ruins and PG&E was millions in debt. Lawyers told Drum that PG&E=20
needed time to recover and should ask for the protection of the courts by=
=20
being put in receivership.=20
"There will be no receiver," said Drum. He then pulled PG&E through its=20
financial crisis by levying a $10 assessment on each share of the company's=
=20
stock, issuing bonds and using every means he could to keep the company=20
afloat.=20
Unfortunately, times are different and definitions of honor, morality and=
=20
loyalty have changed. Is Glynn immoral? I don't know. But he isn't a worthy=

Although California's small, coal-fired power plants account for less than =

The nation is hungry for options as the energy crisis threatens to spread.=

Coal, the fuel that powered the Industrial Revolution, fell out of favor ov=

None of the new plants are in California, although 10 are in the West. Thos=

Although there is much debate about the environmental ramifications of=20

Coal is the nation's most abundant fossil fuel. There are about 250 billion=

``My job and the job of others will be to convince many in the country who=

Blackouts this summer?=20
Perhaps the timing was coincidental, but Friday's announcement by Pacific G=
as=20
& Electric that it will seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection served as a d=
im=20
comment on the industry's confidence that California Gov. Gray Davis really=
=20
has a handle on the state's looming electricity crisis. Unfortunately, Gov.=
=20
Davis' speech Thursday evening, while a bit more realistic than previous=20
statements in that he acknowledged the need for rate increases, suggests th=
e=20
governor is not considering a sensible way out of the problem.

In a conference call with journalists Friday morning the governor fleshed o=
ut=20
some of the bare bones he offered the public the night before. His proposed=
=20
rate increase is slightly smaller than one the Public Utility Commission=20
proposed last week and will hit heavy users harder. He promised that a=20
revenue bond his office is still assembling would repay the general fund=20
money the state government has spent and pay some utility debts too. He=20
emphasized that increasing supply is the only long-term answer and said his=
=20
office is working "at warp speed" to get permits for new plants approved.=
=20
Four small ones should be online this summer.=20

But he still sees state control rather than a freer market as the proper=20
approach. He said the state would stop buying electricity directly in 2003=
=20
but would set up a new regulatory structure to supervise those who do. He=
=20
acknowledged the need for rate increases but wants rates set by regulators=
=20
rather than by buyers and sellers.=20

We might eventually get stability under such a system. But it would be a=20
needlessly expensive stability.=20

Looming over all is the near-certainty of summer blackouts.=20

The latest summer projections by California's Independent System Operator,=
=20
the bureaucratic agency through which most energy transactions in the state=
=20
are funneled, are more pessimistic and more realistic than previous=20
estimates. But even these latest projections might understate the severity.=
=20

The 2001 CAISO summer assessment forecasts resource deficiencies for June=
=20
through September ranging from almost 3,700 megawatts in June down to about=
 a=20
600 MW shortfall in September. The cover memo notes that "Given this=20
forecast, the CAISO expects that load curtailments (blackouts) will occur=
=20
this summer."

Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock pointed out to us, however, that the=
=20
governor took over the ISO board with a flurry of new appointments. Sen.=20
McClintock says his staff has heard rumblings of political pressures to=20
minimize doom-and-gloom projections.=20

Last December the ISO estimated a different "peak power demand" (what's=20
demanded with millions of air conditioners running) for each summer month -=
=20
49,462 MW for June, 48,759 for July, 50,829 for August and 47,047 for=20
September.=20

The March 22 report applies the same maximum peak load to every month "sinc=
e=20
the CAISO cannot accurately forecast when the system summer peak will occur=
."=20
And the figure is at the low end of the previous estimates at 47,703 MW.

The ISO says that "potential demand reductions and possible new supply=20
resources are not considered," so conservation measures and price increases=
=20
haven't been included. The report expects the new plants Gov. Davis mention=
ed=20
to come online in June and later.

Robert Michaels, the Cal State Fullerton energy economist, told us there ar=
e=20
so many variables and so many reasonably valid forecasting models that the=
=20
variances between the two reports might not be all that significant. "In an=
y=20
event, this report is plenty scary. Consumers, especially large industrial=
=20
operations, are going to have to make big adjustments in how they use=20
energy," he told us.

A report from the respected consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), headed by author Daniel Yergin, estimat es 20=20
blackout-hours during the summer. Only four such blackouts have happened so=
=20
far.=20

A newspaper article by Mr. Yergin and Lawrence Markovich, after analyzing=
=20
flaws in the misnamed 1996 "deregulation" scheme says, "Instead of fixing=
=20
these flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are moving California dow=
n=20
the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers=
=20
and businesses."

Robert Michaels thinks industries are already making adjustments and will=
=20
make more when they see the bills they get in May.

By now almost all the reputed experts say there are likely to be significan=
t=20
power shortfalls and rolling blackouts this summer. Businesses that don't=
=20
already have backup generators might do well to get them, and to adjust the=
=20
hours in which they use power most intensively. This could be, as Mr.=20
Michaels put it, "a summer like we've never seen before."

CERA thinks it will take California two or three years to re-establish=20
something resembling reliable energy. It just might take suffering in the=

Pacific Gas Files for Chapter 11



By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and Electric, California's
largest utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday
despite months of efforts by state officials to bail out the
cash-starved company.


The utility's 13 million customers probably will be among the
least affected, since bankruptcy proceedings allow companies to
continue operating while trying to dig out of their financial hole.


But lenders, bondholders and power generators may have to write
off billions advanced to the utility as losses. And the company's
financial reputation could be damaged for years, making it more
difficult to raise money to upgrade transmission lines and plants.


``The regulatory and political processes have failed us, and now
we are turning to the court,'' company chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr.
said. ``We expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach
a solution, which thus far the state and the state's regulators
have been unable to achieve.''


The company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corp., had run up an $8.9
billion deficit buying electricity as of Feb. 28. Like other
California utilities, it has been pinched by skyrocketing wholesale
power costs and the state's 1996 deregulation law barring rate
increases.


As of March 29, the utility had $2.6 billion in cash and
outstanding bills of $4.4 billion. Shares of PG&amp;E Corp. were halted
on the New York Stock Exchange, where they last traded at $11.36,
down 2 cents.


The company provides natural gas and electric service across
Northern and Central California. It has 21,500 employees.


The bankruptcy filing came one day after Gov. Gray Davis, in a
statewide address, proposed relieving utilities' debts by giving
them a share of a record rate increase approved last week and by
continuing to negotiate the state's purchase of their transmission
lines.


PG&amp;E Corp., however, said those negotiations were ``going
nowhere.''


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the bankruptcy filing was a
complete surprise. He said aides were meeting with the attorney
general's office and bankruptcy lawyers to discuss the
implications.


Consumer activists were quick to pounce on the news as more
evidence that the utility is not getting enough help from its
parent company, which has profited during California's energy
crisis.


``The parent company has $30 billion, much of which it has
siphoned out of the utility coffers. It would have bailed the
utility out,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.


PG&amp;E Corp. said its subsidiary was forced into bankruptcy
because of ``unreimbursed energy costs, which are now increasing by
more than $300 million per month,'' state regulatory decisions that
are hurting the company and ``the now unmistakable fact that
negotiations with Gov. Gray Davis and his representatives are going
nowhere.''


Southern California Edison, the state's second-largest utility,
was not affected by the filing. Officials at parent Edison
International were meeting Friday to discuss the situation.


Edison International's stock was down $3.63, or 29 percent, to
$9.01 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.


The stock of Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas
&amp; Electric that serves 3 million customers in the San Diego area,
was down $2.17, or 9 percent, to $21.98 per share.


The three utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion
since June because of soaring wholesale costs. SoCal Edison and
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are barred under the state's deregulation
law from raising rates to recover the costs and are having trouble
buying power and natural gas because of poor credit.


In his five-minute televised speech Thursday evening, Davis said
rate increases are needed to help pay for power purchased by the
state on behalf of the utilities. The purchases have cost taxpayers
$4.7 billion since January.


Davis said his tiered rate plan would mean no increase for most
residents and an average increase of 26.5 percent for the rest. The
Public Utilities Commission has already approved rate increases of
up to 46 percent for customers of SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric.


The power crisis led to rolling blackouts in January and earlier
this month as electricity supplies dwindled to nearly nothing.


On Thursday, state power grid managers said California will see
more than a month of rolling blackouts for as many as 5 million
people at a time if residents use as much power this summer as last
summer.


The crisis is blamed a number of factors, including high demand,
high wholesale costs and a tight supply worsened by scarce
hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance of aging
California power plants.


The governor has signed contracts and agreements in principle to
secure the state's long-term power needs, committing $53 billion
that eventually must be paid back by taxpayers and utility
customers.

Davis endorses rate hikes, defends handling of energy crisis



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Gov. Gray Davis for the first time endorsed
rate increases for customers of two strapped utilities, while
urging conservation and defending his handling of the state's
energy crisis.


Davis, addressing Californians in a televised speech Thursday,
also lashed out at federal regulators for refusing to cap soaring
wholesale electricity prices that have pushed the state's two
largest utilities toward bankruptcy.


``In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job,
California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no
longer afford to buy,'' Davis said. ``We didn't take over to save
the utilities. We took over to keep the power on and the economy
strong.''


California has been hit by severe electricity shortages and
rolling blackouts the past few months. The problem is blamed on a
variety of factors, including deregulation of California's electric
industry which does not allow utilities to pass on to customers
sharply increased costs.


Davis, who repeatedly has said the state can resolve the power
problems without rate hikes, told viewers he now thinks rate
increases are necessary.


His new stance comes after the state Public Utilities Commission
last week approved rate increases of up to 46 percent for customers
of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.


Davis said he will propose a tiered rate plan that will mean a
26.5 percent rate increase for the average Edison or PG&amp;E customer.
Under the governor's plan, the heaviest power users would see an
average 34.5 percent rate increase.


``The more you use, the more you pay,'' he said. ``Conservation
is our best short-term weapon against blackouts and price
gouging.''


Davis said the state's power crunch and high wholesale costs are
the result of a ``flawed deregulation scheme'' signed into law in
1996 by then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.


Davis urged Californians to help cut power use 10 percent to
fend off rolling blackouts this summer, when residents will turn on
their air conditioners and demand will rise sharply.


The Legislature on Thursday afternoon sent Davis proposals that
would spend dlrs 1.1 billion on conservation programs for consumers
and businesses. Davis said he plans to sign the measures.

Sempra Energy And SDG&E Reaffirm Strong Financial Position in Response to=
=20
PG&E Bankruptcy



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Sempra Energy and San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) officials took the opportunity of toda=
y's
Chapter 11 bankruptcy announcement by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)=
 to
reaffirm their companies' strong financial position and the
significant regulatory and legislative differences between SDG&amp;E and
PG&amp;E.


"We want to reassure our customers and shareholders that Sempra
Energy and SDG&amp;E remain very strong and financially viable companies,"
said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer
of Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&amp;E. "SDG&amp;E is continuing
its record of providing safe and reliable gas and electric service for
our 1.2 million customers today, tomorrow and for years to come. There
are several significant financial, legislative and regulatory
differences that distinguish Sempra Energy and SDG&amp;E from PG&amp;E."


SDG&amp;E is covered under Assembly Bill 265, a law signed by the
Governor last September which guaranteed that SDG&amp;E will be able to
collect the difference between the capped price of electricity and the
wholesale cost of power, providing the power was prudently purchased.
PG&amp;E is not covered by AB 265 and that guarantee. At the end of
February, the under-collection in the balancing account was $681
million. Since the state's power procurement agency, the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR), has been purchasing power for
SDG&amp;E, the growth of the company's balancing account has slowed
significantly.


Unlike PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E has been able to pay its wholesale electric
bills to the DWR, the California Independent System Operator, the
California Power Exchange and Qualifying Facilities that cogenerate
power for the utility. Additionally, the Sempra Energy companies have
no significant credit exposure to PG&amp;E.


"Sempra Energy and SDG&amp;E have long advocated that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission institute temporary regional wholesale
price caps to help stem the financial problems such as those
experienced by PG&amp;E," Baum added. "We are also committed to promoting
and instituting comprehensive energy conservation programs for all
customers to help control bills and decrease the chances of rotating
outages this summer."


Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500
energy services holding company with 12,000 employees and annual
revenues of $5.4 billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries --
SoCalGas, SDG&amp;E, Sempra Energy Solutions, Sempra Energy Trading,
Sempra Energy International, Sempra Energy Resources, Sempra
Communications and Sempra Energy Financial -- Sempra Energy serves
more than 9 million customers in the United States, Europe, Canada,
Mexico and South America.
