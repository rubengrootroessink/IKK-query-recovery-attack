Steve and Jim,

The following is my report regarding the California numbers.  As you know, within the next few weeks (and possibly as soon as Friday), we should have more accurate information.  I will continue to update this report will the most current figures.  Please pass along any information that I may add. 


 

Thank you,
Bryan
