Mark and Steve - I haven't revisited the reallocation since I submitted it, 
but will follow up on this to see where it stands.

Subject: International Regulatory and Government Affairs Plan versus YTD 
actuals

Just received the documents/computer printout dated 6/8/00 for the 
above-referenced cost centers.  If I am reading it correctly, they are 
showing the following:

International Regulatory Affairs:

Actual, periods 1-5, $473,331.78, versus Plan of $946,665.00, for a net under 
Plan of $473,333.22

International Government Affairs:

Actual, periods 1-5, $236,206.59, versus Plan of $553,680.00, for a net under 
Plan of $317,473.41.

Steve, I bothered to write this e-mail, as I recall Jim Hughes initially 
making some noise (to you) about my initial request for codes so I could bill 
my time to APACHI.  While there were some other issues surrounding that, I 
seem to recall that he said he had not seen any reduction in his cost 
allocation, at the same time that I was seemingly looking to add costs to his 
area.  You told me that you assured him that he would see it coming through 
in later periods.  In any event, now that we have several months data, if you 
wanted to take the opportunity, you could confirm for him the YTD under Plan 
total of nearly $800,000, through May, and note further that this reorg. was 
not really fully accomplished until around March 1, e.g., David Merrill being 
charged to EBS.  Let me know if you need more, hopefully this is helpful with 
Jim, and possibly Rebecca.   mcs
