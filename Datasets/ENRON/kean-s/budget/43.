In case Paul did not share them with you, here are the ideas for mission, strategic objectives and key issues which I submitted to him after some discussion with Hennemeyer and Wood. I hope you will between you have the opportunity to impress upon Sherriff, Frevert and Whalley the risks inherent in reducing our efforts significantly. In my view that could amount to abandoning some of the identified objectives at a point where we are 80% of the way to reaching them. A reduction would also impair our ability to deliver to the commercial teams advanced and inside information on/ interpretation of regulatory and political shifts.
