Jeff - 

Thanks for your note.  We have in fact placed this work on hold several weeks ago, differing commitments on $28 mill. in tower tenant improvements and corresponding $22.5 mill. in furniture purchases.  In addition we have put on hold further construction activity related to the new Data Center - Disaster Recovery project on beltway 8, avoiding another 20 mill. in costs over the coming 10 months.

- Bill

I have recommended to Greg that we delay the tower improvements until a later date once things clear up a little.  Please begin to plan for that accordingly.  I will be back to you as soon as I get Greg's approval.

Thanks.
