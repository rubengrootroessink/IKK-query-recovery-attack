Christi,
=09As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard =
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being =
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential consequ=
ences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, then we =
may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission market=
, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach as =
was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO Coordina=
tion (Seams) Conference:

"Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard ta=
riff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing diffe=
rent proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single mark=
et model."

=09In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for eith=
er filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a "feet to=
 the fire" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for =
a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we sho=
uld specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission ri=
ghts issue, for instance, a simple "don't allocate" solution won't work.  T=
he lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the la=
ck of information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed=
 suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be p=
ressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power. =20

=09It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tarif=
f without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not i=
s a moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a rec=
ord.  There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome=
 of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a prett=
y good record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of good=
ies such as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a =
distinct risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is g=
iven blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge up=
hill battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on curr=
ent  RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rule=
making creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule c=
uts off options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior =
to the issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On t=
he other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued=
.  This also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies si=
tting on their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, w=
hile whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessa=
ry to boost their own position.

=09These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Po=
wer this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next wee=
k.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while mayb=
e the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and ado=
pt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the I=
SO being required to provide much greater information on where the congesti=
on occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic=
 nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to =
all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the =
information about congestion from the past several years, they could essent=
ially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade "above" the=
 underlying FTRs as financial instruments.

Jim,

=09I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM"=
 approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion =
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as =
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized=
 approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time chan=
ging horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of governmen=
t.

=09The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation=
 problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -=
- none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the=
 biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the=
 nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

=09During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that=
 a centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PN=
W) with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectri=
c and thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro=
-thermal operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW o=
perations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commit=
ment.  Given other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the =
paper and its examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant=
 to endorse a centralize unit commitment implementation.
