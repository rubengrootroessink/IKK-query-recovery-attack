Steve:

 I hope this is not too presumptuous, but I'd like to directly advise you of 
my organization within Corporate HR.

 I am the Senior Director of the Office of Labor and Employment Relations 
(formerly known as the Fair Employment and Labor Practices Group).  I joined 
Enron in February after spending 11 years with MCI WorldCom where I was 
Associate Litigation Counsel in Atlanta representing MCI, and then WorldCom, 
in all of their employment law matters in the Southeast.  Before MCI, I 
practiced labor and employment law with two large law firms, including Vinson 
& Elkins here in Houston.  

 As you will note from the attached org chart, there are seven primary 
functions for which my staff and I am responsible.  In summary fashion, they 
are:

1. Executive Programs (i.e., Impact & Influence, Power of Communication, 
Executive Forums, etc.)

2. Resource Management (i.e, Redeployment, New Hire Orientation)

3. Workforce Development (i.e., diversity efforts such as recruitment, 
training, mentoring, succession planning, etc.)

4. Employee Relations (i.e., EEO charges, internal grievance investigations, 
policy review, advice, etc.)

5. Labor Relations (i.e., union awareness, collective bargaining negotiation, 
M&A advice, etc.)

6. Government Programs (i.e., affirmative action plans, gov't reporting 
requirements, gov't audits, etc.)

7. Employment Law Training (i.e., discrimination, sexual harassment, 
performance management, interviewing skills, etc.  -- all from a risk 
management perspective).

 I hope to be able to spend some time with you filling in the details and 
answering any questions you have.  In the meantime, please let me know if 
there is anything I can provide for you.

Brian
