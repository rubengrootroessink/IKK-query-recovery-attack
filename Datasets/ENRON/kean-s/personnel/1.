Have also today spoken to Anthony Duenner, finally.  I am afraid the message 
for David is that we should be thinking about his exit.  I cannot see much 
mileage in putting him in front of Cliff.  Do you agree that we should be 
discussing exit package?   thanks  mcs

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Rebecca

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?
