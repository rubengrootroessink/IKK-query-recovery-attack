Joe/Orlando,  We just finalized the process of the terminations/transitions 
in SP except for the following employees:

1.  Robert Gross is out of the office  (I'll handled on Monday)
2.  Ana Cristina Santos went home sick  (I'll handled on Monday)
3.  Jorge Gumuccio is out of the office  (I'll handled on Wednesday upon his 
return to office)

The process went better than expected.  A number of employees that were 
terminated "thank us" for taking this step now as all were waiting for this 
process since the date of org. announcement.  In total we spoke to 27 
employees in Sao Paulo and 32 in Buenos Aires.  The climate in the office is 
positive.  Offering outplacement to terminated employees help us 
tremendously, especially having them in the office for the employees to 
consult with immediately after the termination process was completed.  Let me 
know if you have any questions, Miguel
