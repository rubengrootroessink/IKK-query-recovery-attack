Laws aim at saving energy
By Emily Bazar
BEE CAPITOL BUREAU
(Published April 12, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis insists that Californians who own aging appliances or shive=
r=20
in drafty homes aren't the only ones who will benefit from two major=20
energy-conservation bills he signed into law Wednesday.=20
Instead, the Democratic governor -- who is wrestling with the state's energ=
y=20
crisis as summertime blackouts loom -- has billed the measures as an=20
opportunity for all Californians to save precious megawatts in the critical=
=20
coming months.=20
"Clearly, the cheapest megawatt this summer is the megawatt we don't have t=
o=20
buy," said Davis, who vetoed more than $250 million from the bills, leaving=
=20
about $860 million for energy-saving programs.=20
The governor has said many times that conservation is a key element of his=
=20
overall plan to solve the energy crisis, and that these bills -- SB 5x by=
=20
state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, and AB 29x by Assemblywoman Christine=
=20
Kehoe, D-San Diego -- embody that commitment.=20
Crafted to complement each other, the measures include money for a wide ran=
ge=20
of programs, most of which exist. For instance, the bills dedicate millions=
=20
of dollars to low-income families who need help paying their electricity=20
bills and to families who hope to install solar panels on their roofs.=20
Taken together, the conservation programs are expected to save roughly 2,00=
0=20
megawatts this summer, enough energy to power about 2 million homes, Davis=
=20
said.=20
In deciding what to veto, Davis said he shaved or eliminated provisions tha=
t=20
would not yield energy savings by summertime.=20
"Everything we're doing in SB 5x and AB 29x is targeted toward reducing=20
electricity demand during hot summer afternoons to help avoid rolling=20
blackouts," said Claudia Chandler, a spokeswoman for the California Energy=
=20
Commission.=20
Among their many provisions, the bills include $90 million in rebates or=20
other incentives to encourage Californians to replace inefficient washing=
=20
machines, air conditioners and other appliances with newer energy-saving=20
models.=20
Currently, rebates for energy-efficient refrigerators average about $75, pl=
us=20
the cost of removing the old refrigerator.=20
The incentives will be available to customers of investor-owned utilities,=
=20
such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co., and municipal utilities, such as the=
=20
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.=20
SMUD expects its share will be between $6 million and $9 million, said Mike=
=20
Weedall, manager of energy services.=20
Some of the $90 million also will go toward helping low-income residents=20
weatherize their homes and pay their utility bills.=20
In all, the measures provide $240 million in low-income assistance,=20
encouraging people to install double-paned windows and insulation where the=
y=20
live to save power and reduce their energy bills.=20
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the bills include assistan=
ce=20
for California's families who can least afford the average 29 percent rate=
=20
hike recently approved by the California Public Utilities Commission for PG=
&E=20
and Southern California Edison customers.=20
"They're the ones that will end up freezing to death when they can't pay=20
their bills," Burton said. "We're doing all this (other) stuff; we ought to=

The bills also include $60 million in rebates and incentives to help=20
consumers and businesses reduce their lighting and $105 million to encourag=
e=20
renewable and other Earth-friendly power generation projects, such as rooft=
op=20
solar panels.=20
In order to entice Californians to participate in these programs, the=20
measures provide $10 million for a public-awareness campaign.=20
The measures' journeys through the Legislature, however, were fraught with=
=20
roadblocks. The Assembly, for instance, last week added several proposals=

favorable to farmers.=20
One of their proposals would have limited the amount of time interruptible=
=20
agricultural customers could lose energy to four hours a day or 20 hours a=
=20
month. "Interruptible" customers volunteer to lose power in emergencies in=

among all customers, not just agricultural ones.=20
Sandra Spelliscy, general counsel for the Planning and Conservation League,=

Enron ordered to provide power to state's colleges

BEE LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER
(Published April 12, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Wednesday ordered a major energy supplier =
to=20
resume service to California's universities, ruling that the Texas-based=20
company probably had no right to switch the schools to public utilities for=
=20
their electricity.=20
U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton issued a preliminary injunction=20
holding Texas-based Enron Energy Systems Inc. to the final year of a=20
four-year contract to sell energy directly to the University of California=
=20
and California State University. Unless a higher court rules otherwise, her=
=20
order will remain effective until the results of a full-scale trial.=20
The two university systems signed the contract to get relief from the risk =
of=20
relying on shaky utilities, Hamilton said. She said the company took away=
=20
that security when it switched 29 of the state's 33 campuses to Pacific Gas=
 &=20
Electric and Southern California Edison during the past two months.=20
She noted PG&E's precarious position since filing for bankruptcy last week.=
=20
In applying for the injunction, lawyers representing the universities argue=
d=20
that Enron was motivated by a desire to sell as much of its electricity as=
=20
possible on the spot market, where huge profits have become available. The=
=20
universities' contract with Enron, signed in 1998, sets their rate at 5=20
percent less than the rate being charged by the utilities.=20
Appearing before Hamilton in support of the schools, state Attorney General=
=20
Bill Lockyer argued that Enron, in effect, was saying, "We don't want to se=
ll=20
power at the price we promised."=20
But Enron's lawyer, A. William Urquhart, said the company had a duty to its=
=20
shareholders to act in their economic interest.=20
He said he would take the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals=
=20
immediately. He asked Hamilton to stay it until the circuit court can act,=
=20
but she refused.=20
In papers filed with the court, Urquhart said Enron switched many customers=
=20
to the utilities as the "most logical way to mitigate the impact" of losses=
=20
the company incurred after it stopped getting paid by the California=20
utilities almost a year ago.=20
Enron will pay the difference between the rate it promised the universities=
=20
and the rates charged them by the utilities, he said.=20
But the universities said they were losing other contracted benefits,=20
including protection from the threat of blackouts and a sophisticated Enron=
=20
metering and billing system that's an essential part of a conservation=20
program.=20
After the hearing, Lockyer called the ruling an important victory over a=20
company that he said has best exemplified the "gouging" and "piracy" of=20
California consumers during the energy crisis.=20
He said an investigation by his office that could lead to civil or criminal=
=20
charges against energy suppliers should be completed by summer.=20

PG&E shorts counties $4.2 million: Poorer local governments say it'll be=20
tough to get by with half a tax ration.
By Jennifer K. Morita
BEE STAFF WRITER=20
(Published April 12, 2001)

After filing for bankruptcy protection last week, Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. notified local county governments that it won't be able to pay $4.2=20
million it owes them in property taxes.=20
That left officials from El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento,=20
Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties with mixed feelings. Some said reserve funds=
=20
will cover the losses, at least for now. But officials of other, smaller=20
counties that rely on PG&E tax money to pay for public services, employees'=
=20
salaries and various programs, are nervously crossing their fingers as they=
=20
watch the utility's bankruptcy proceedings.=20
PG&E owes California counties $79 million for the Jan. 1-June 30 property t=
ax=20
installment that was due Tuesday. It paid slightly less than half of what i=
t=20
owes.=20
PG&E officials said the company was limited in what it could pay because of=
=20
the bankruptcy filing, and paid only what was due for April 6-June 30.=20
"Under the bankruptcy law we can pay our obligation going forward as part o=
f=20
normal business operation," PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Wednesday. "We woul=
d=20
need the court's approval to pay any pre-petition, or pre-filing obligation=
."=20
Low added, however, that the utility intends to ask the court to let it pay=
=20
the balance. "We fully intend to pay the entire amount owed in property=20
taxes," Low said.=20
Two of the hardest-hit counties are Yuba and Plumas.=20
Yuba County, one of the poorest in the state, depends heavily on PG&E tax=
=20
dollars, said County Treasurer-Tax Collector Jim Kennedy.=20
"PG&E is the largest single taxpayer in the county, and the percentage it=
=20
represents of our total tax revenues is the largest share for any county in=
=20
the state," Kennedy said.=20
Although PG&E failed to pay its semiannual installment of $794,292, Kennedy=
=20
remained optimistic that a check was in the mail. Still, the county will be=
=20
receiving $417,003 less than it is owed.=20
In Plumas County, where PG&E is the largest private property owner, officia=
ls=20
are reeling from the tax loss.=20
The utility company paid $762,519 on Tuesday, less than half the $1.6 milli=
on=20
it owed.=20
Plumas County government's share of the shortfall is around $250,000, said=
=20
treasurer Barbara J. Coates. The rest goes to schools, which won't be=20
affected immediately because the state will make up for the missing revenue=
.=20
The county's loss could affect raises for all 350 employees, a countywide=
=20
arts program, library hours and improvements to local campgrounds, said Boa=
rd=20
of Supervisors vice chairman Robert Meacher.=20
But the long-term effects are even more disturbing, according to Meacher.=
=20
The utility's $3.2 million annual tax payment makes up about 16 percent of=
=20
the $20 million collected by the county.=20
"The uncertainty over future tax revenues is more of an issue now than the=
=20
actual dollars," said Meacher, who also serves as chairman of the 28-member=
=20
Regional Council of Rural Counties. "Every county that produces hydroelectr=
ic=20
energy for the state of California will be impacted -- some dramatically."=
=20
As of Wednesday morning, Placer County had not received PG&E's second=20
property tax installment of $1.9 million, Treasurer-Tax Collector Jenine=20
Windeshausen said.=20
PG&E officials told Windeshausen that the company will pay a little less th=
an=20
half of the property taxes it owes Placer County.=20
"As far as the county is concerned, we do not anticipate any reduction of=
=20
services due to this," Windeshausen said. "The county has set aside=20
contingencies for these types of situations."=20
He said PG&E's portion represents only slightly more than a half percent of=
=20
the county's total tax collections.=20
"We are going to be proactive in the bankruptcy proceedings. We're definite=
ly=20
pursuing the progress of the bankruptcy court and we're constantly being=20
appraised of our status," Windeshausen said.=20
PG&E pays significant property taxes to Yolo County, according to Don=20
Ishikawa, chief assistant county administrator. Like every county in the=20
state, Yolo keeps only a portion of that money, and the rest is distributed=
=20
to schools, libraries and special districts.=20
Ishikawa said the lost revenue would be a "big hit" for a county with an=20
annual budget of only $210 million. But Yolo has enough money in reserve=20
funds earmarked for property tax losses that there will be no immediate=20
impact, he said.=20
Nevada County Treasurer-Tax Collector E. Christina Dabis said she also is=
=20
waiting for PG&E's second property tax payment of roughly $615,000.=20
"We anticipate getting around $300,000," Dabis said. "Our tax roll is about=
=20
$100 million and they owe us about $600,000, which is less than 1 percent."=
=20
Sacramento County received a $607,794 check from PG&E on Wednesday,=20
representing about 47.5 percent of what was due, said County Assistant Tax=
=20
Collector Linda Pittman.=20
"We'll have to wait for the bankruptcy case to see what we can do," Pittman=
=20
said. "I'm sure we'll be filing a claim with the court for whatever we can.=
"=20
El Dorado County received $232,527 of the $489,530 that was due, according =
to=20
Treasurer-Tax Collector C.L. Raffety.=20
"They have to pay it like everyone else or they incur penalties," Raffety=
=20
said.=20
In Sutter County, PG&E failed to pay its April 10 installment of $448,484,=

You wouldn't normally take energy policy advice from a consumer advocate wh=
o=20
admits that the plan he has in mind for California recalls the plot of "The=
=20
Thief" -- a 1981 thriller about a former safecracker facing down the mob. B=
ut=20
these are not normal times. And Michael Shames is no normal consumer=20
advocate.=20
Shames is the executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network. He=
=20
was also the author of a 1999 paper that accurately predicted today's energ=
y=20
disaster back when most people didn't even know the state's electricity=20
industry had been deregulated. Now he has teamed with University of=20
California, Irvine, professor Peter Navarro to propose an audacious approac=
h=20
to breaking the grip the energy cartel has on California and the West.=20
Shames and Navarro warn that if nothing is done -- and they suggest Gov. Gr=
ay=20
Davis' recent moves might be worse than nothing -- California faces a summe=
r=20
of rolling blackouts and a power bill that might reach $50 billion. That's =
a=20
catastrophe that neither the state's budget nor its economy could withstand=
.=20
Strong measures are needed to prevent it.=20
Their plan comes down to this: Fight fire with fire. Shames and Navarro wan=
t=20
California, Oregon and Washington to form a cooperative to buy their energy=
.=20
Each day, the states would set a price they consider fair and reasonable,=
=20
given the costs of producing electricity and a generous profit margin, say =
30=20
percent.=20
"It's a buyers' cartel," Shames says. "We would give them a dose of their o=
wn=20
medicine."=20
Any power plant operator that wanted to sell electricity in these three=20
states would have to meet the price set by the cooperative. Those who didn'=
t=20
like the price could shut down their plants and sit out the market for the=
=20
day.=20
That's where "The Thief" comes in. In the Michael Mann film starring James=
=20
Caan, a Mafia safecracker longs to go straight and live the American dream =
--=20
a house, a family, a business of his own. He gets all those things, but his=
=20
mob ties insist he do one more job. When he resists, they threaten to take=
=20
away all he holds dear. So he sends away his family, shuts down his busines=
s=20
and burns down the house. You can't hurt me now, he says. I'm ready for you=
.=20
Shames wants California to say to the power generators: We're ready. The=20
generators' greatest weapon is the blackout. The fear of darkness leads us =
to=20
pay any price for the electrons we need to keep the lights on. It's even=20
written into state law, a requirement that the people who run our power gri=
d=20
spend whatever is necessary to keep the juice flowing. They cannot simply s=
ay=20
no, sorry, your price is too high, we'll do without it today.=20
Under this plan, instead of random rolling blackouts sweeping the state=20
without notice, Shames and Navarro suggest rotating outages that are planne=
d=20
and telegraphed ahead of time. That would give predictability to business a=
nd=20
residents, which is what most people want. It also would tip off the crooks=
,=20
of course, who might prey on homes suddenly left without alarms. But the=20
cops, forewarned as well, could mobilize ahead of them with extra patrols.=
=20
"If the worst thing they can do to us is take away the lights, we might be=
=20
able to cope with that," Shames said. "Then they're in trouble. Then they=
=20
start losing big bucks. They have to answer to their stockholders."=20
So far, it's a plan that a free-market economist could love. Buyers pooling=
=20
their clout to win a better price. People sacrificing to get what they want=
.=20
Generators free to participate, or not. Even Gary Ackerman, the glib and=20
cocky spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum, the generators' trade=
=20
group, says it sounds fine to him.=20
"Nothing wrong with a group of buyers banding together to buy a commodity,"=
=20
Ackerman says. "I've got no problem with that whatsoever. If the price they=
=20
offer is less than the market price, we're not selling."=20
That's where things could get nasty. If the blackouts grew too disruptive,=
=20
Shames and Navarro say, Davis and his counterparts in Oregon and Washington=
=20
would have to be willing to use their emergency powers to seize the plants=
=20
that won't play ball. The threat to the states is too great to sit by while=
=20
the generators extract billions of dollars from our businesses and resident=
s=20
and ride off into the sunset.=20
"We are very concerned that over the next six months, a combination of mark=
et=20
manipulation and the natural forces of electricity shortages will allow the=
se=20
generators to gorge on us as they never have before," Navarro said. "Is tha=
t=20
tolerable? Do we just grin and bear it and give them the money, or do we do=
=20
something?"=20
Today, with Davis making incremental progress and promising that all will b=
e=20
well, this plan sounds radical. But Shames has been a prophet before. And w=

?????Severin Borenstein, director of the UC Energy Institute in Berkeley,=

estimated that the funds would cover enough meters for businesses that=20

?????"It is reasonable to estimate that we could take 2,000 to 3,000=20

Failure to Buy Entire Network May Doom Davis' Power Deal=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Does it make sense for California to own only part of the=
=20
state's power grid?
?????That question is dividing state legislators and energy experts after=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' announcement of a $2.76-billion deal to buy Southern=20
California Edison's transmission lines. The deal was reached Monday, three=
=20
days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. balked at selling its power lines to=
=20
the state and filed for bankruptcy.
?????Davis and Democratic legislators have pushed to purchase the whole=20
transmission system owned by the state's debt-saddled private utilities. Th=
ey=20
reason that by owning the highway that electricity must travel to reach hom=
es=20
and businesses--a 32,000-mile web of wire that is the world's fifth-largest=
=20
coordinated power grid--the state would gain a negotiating advantage with t=
he=20
companies that produce the power.
?????If California's transmission grid were entirely owned by the public,=
=20
political leaders believe, the state could gain jurisdiction over key=20
electricity issues now decided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,=
=20
which has been reluctant to intervene in the energy crisis. The state, not=
=20
the commission, could then set its own transmission fees and control the fl=
ow=20
of electricity across the grid.
?????Transmission charges bring in roughly $1.4 billion a year for the thre=
e=20
utilities. With that money, the state could not only repay itself for the=
=20
purchase of the power lines but also fund system upgrades to unclog=20
electricity bottlenecks that contribute to blackouts.
?????"Owning the wires is a business, and this business operates at a=20
profit," said Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), who will head a=
=20
series of committee hearings on the plan to buy the Edison lines. "We're no=
t=20
going into their yards and buying old trucks or something; we are buying a=
=20
vital piece of their electrical system."
?????However, now that Pacific Gas & Electric has opted to try to find a=20
solution to its debt problem in Bankruptcy Court rather than continue=20
negotiations with the state, the prospects of California acquiring the enti=
re=20
system appear uncertain at best.
?????That is generating concern about what California is getting for its=20
money--and whether the state stands a chance of gaining any independence fr=

Electric.=20
?????The Edison deal, which needs legislative approval, is unlikely to garn=
er=20
a single vote from Republicans--Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair=
=20
Oaks) calls the grid purchase a socialistic idea. The plan may also encount=
er=20
some Democratic opposition.
?????"It was a tough sell to begin with, and I think if you are going to on=
ly=20
buy part, it becomes a tougher sell," said Assemblyman Dean Florez=20
(D-Shafter).
?????And some utility experts say California gains little, if anything,=20
unless it acquires the whole system.
?????"The motivating factor for buying the grid, as opposed to hydroelectri=
c=20
power plants, is because it addressed the central problem facing California=
:=20
The federal government is unwilling to crack down on the generators that ar=
e=20
ripping us off, and we need to take back control," said UC Irvine professor=
=20
Peter Navarro. "If you only buy 40% of the system, you might as well have=
=20
nothing."
?????California would not be able to make some of the most critical upgrade=
s=20
needed to improve the flow of electricity if it did not acquire PG&E's=20
portion of the system. The worst energy bottleneck in California is the=20
notorious Path 15, a series of high-voltage lines that move power between=
=20
Southern and Northern California. Path 15 lies largely in PG&E's territory.
?????Davis and some state legislators say California still has a chance to=
=20
buy the entire grid. Some, in fact, believe that the utility's bankruptcy=

increases the likelihood of a deal: Talks between Davis and PG&E had falter=
ed=20
in recent weeks, and a judge may have better luck bridging their difference=
s.
?????Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric continue,=
=20
leaving the possibility of a deal with that utility.
?????But acquiring PG&E's portion, the largest and most important by far, n=
ow=20
requires the approval of a federal Bankruptcy Court judge. And in that aren=
a,=20
the state may have to compete with private companies for the lines.
?????Trans-Elect, a Washington company that wants to create a national=20
network of independently owned transmission lines, has offered to buy and=

company has also been in contact with the Davis administration on the=20
possibility of leasing the lines from California if they are bought by the=

state.
?????For the state to buy any of the systems, it needs approval from=20
FERC--far from a sure thing. The commission in recent years has encouraged=

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis signed an $850 billion conservation package=
=20
yesterday that will pour millions into loans and grants for Californians to=
=20
make their homes and businesses more energy efficient.=20
Much of the money will beef up existing conservation programs, which means=

low-interest loans and grants to low-income residents, small businesses and=
=20

Davis said the programs wouldn't help save energy during the summer. He=20
previously said he wanted to spend $1 billion on new conservation programs.=
=20
Among the existing programs receiving more money are ones offering loans,=
=20
grants and cash to business, agricultural, residential and low-income=20
ratepayers.=20
They include rebates on purchases of new refrigerators and air conditioners=
,=20
grants to place reflective surfaces on roofs and incentives to create "dema=
nd=20
responsive" buildings that are connected to the Internet. When power alerts=
=20
occur, thermostats or lights are automatically adjusted in the buildings to=
=20

One-fifth of the money is devoted to programs helping the state's poorest=
=20
ratepayers.=20
Of the $240 million in low-income aid, $100 million will go toward=20
subsidizing up to 25 percent of poor households' gas or electric bills.=20
Another $120 million goes to subsidies and grants for home energy savers li=

For the programs it already operates, the state energy commission expects t=

The new programs won't be ready quite so rapidly. A spokeswoman for the=20
commission expected them to be running in June.=20
Among those new programs are $35 million for a voluntary program for big=20

It's hard to say what California's power cost could be this year because=20

But with market prices spiraling, experts say this year's bill is sure to b=

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network=

in San Diego. ``The dollars we're talking about are huge.''=20
The total cost of power in California was $7 billion in 1999 and $27 billio=

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20

It's unclear whether the state's $50 million daily estimate even includes=

But experts say it's unlikely the state is counting those costs, which now=

are running about $20 million a day.=20
``This is additional money you're paying,'' Wolak said.=20
What has Wolak and other experts more worried, however, is the growing cost=
=20
of electricity futures for this summer.=20
Futures are contracts reserving the right to buy a commodity such as=20
electricity at a set price on a later date. Like stocks and bonds, they are=
=20
traded on several exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
``Futures prices reflect people's best estimate of what the spot price woul=

Energy companies that trade electricity futures are loathe to talk about th=

Mark Palmer, spokesman for Texas-based Enron Corp., said his company is=20
paying high prices, too. ``If we're buying for $750, we're going to turn=20
around and try to sell at $751,'' he said. ``The spreads between the prices=

Experts, however, warn that prices could go higher.=20
In December, when California went to Stage 3 alerts, Pigeon of TransAlta=20
Energy Marketing saw spot prices soar. ``There was a weekend when our coal=

"Edison also agreed to invest $3 billion over five years in improvements to=

to convince "the bankruptcy court that we are the appropriate buyer" of=20

Utilities Allegedly Gouged Calif.



LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Private power wholesalers have been blamed
for driving up California's electricity prices but even
government-owned utilities allegedly manipulated the market,
maximizing profits and inflaming the energy crisis, according to a
confidential document obtained by the Los Angeles Times.


The document shows that the power providers, including the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power, influenced the spiraling
costs of wholesale electricity between May and November 2000.


The DWP was eighth on the list of alleged price gougers for
seeking high prices during periods of high demand, which helped
inflate costs across the entire spot market, the document said.


The document decodes the identities of unnamed power providers
in a recent study by the California Independent System Operator.
CISO examined thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large
electricity providers.


DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the findings
``outrageous.''


``We have consistently charged (CISO) our cost plus 15
percent,'' Freeman said. ``It's not as though we're up there
peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats.''


In addition to the DWP, the document singles out two other
government-run agencies that it said consistently inflated prices:
the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific
Northwest, and the trading arm of Canada's BC Hydro in British
Columbia.


BC Hydro reaped the most in what the state's power-grid operator
deemed ``excess profits.'' The Canadian agency took in $176
million, several times the amount of allegedly excessive earnings
collected by all but one private generator. Second on the list was
Atlanta-based Mirant which collected nearly $97 million.


The companies cited said they broke no state rules and abided by
California's 1996 deregulation law, the Times reported Wednesday.


BC Hydro officials acknowledged, however, that they anticipated
periods of severe power shortages and let their reservoirs fill
with water overnight, then opened them to produce cheap
hydroelectric power to sell at a premium.


``It was the marketplace that determined what the price of
electricity would be at any given time,'' BC Hydro spokesman Wayne
Cousins told the Times. ``We helped keep the lights on in
California.''

PG&E's Money Transfers Focused On



By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and Electric is in bankruptcy
court, but its holding company remains profitable, partly because
the utility transferred billions of dollars to its corporate parent
in the years leading up to its financial collapse. Is this fair?


Whether the money handed over to PG&amp;E Corp. represented business
as usual or a raid on the utility's finances will probably become a
pivotal issue in the bankruptcy case, affecting millions of
customers and thousands of creditors.


From 1997 through September 2000, the utility paid $4.63 billion
to the parent company and received nothing in return, according to
a state-ordered audit completed in January.


In another controversial move made the night before the Chapter
11 bankruptcy filing April 6, the utility paid 6,000 employees a
total $50 million in bonuses and raises _ an average of more than
$8,000 per worker.


``I would expect that the creditors are going to be looking at
all that transferred money as money that they should have been
getting paid by the utility,'' said bankruptcy professor Judy
Beckner Sloan of the Southwestern University School of Law in Los
Angeles.


To get to the bottom of what happened, lawyers will probably
exhume e-mail exchanges among PG&amp;E management, take depositions
from top executives and pore over reams of documents, said Tampa,
Fla., lawyer Bill Zewadski, co-chairman of the American Bar
Association's bankruptcy litigation subcommittee.


``It's going to be a very complicated process, something that
could drag on for years,'' Zewadski said.


Even if the creditors decide to go after the money that flowed
from the utility to parent company, it will be difficult, if not
impossible, to recover the cash.


Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, the
state's two biggest utilities, say they have lost more than $13
billion since June because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices
and California's 1996 deregulation law, which bars them from
passing those costs on to customers.


The crisis has led to rolling blackouts over the past few months
and warnings from the two utilities that they were sliding toward
ruin.


PG&amp;E, which made $753 million during the first nine months of
2000, up 40 percent from the same period the year before, already
has spent most of the utility money to pay shareholder dividends
and buy back stock to boost its market value. The parent company
also invested $838 million in its still-thriving power-generating
subsidiaries.


Those unregulated subsidiaries, lumped together as the National
Energy Group, are not a part of the regulated utility, but they
could be pulled into the bankruptcy case if creditors prove the
parent company's investments in National Energy should have been
made in the utility instead.


Should a judge decide the parent company acted wrongfully and
there isn't enough money to repay the utility's creditors, the
bankruptcy code allows for a court judgment holding the parent
company liable, said Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy professor at the
UCLA School of Law.


If the liability were large enough, it could also force the
parent company into bankruptcy.


PG&amp;E executives said they are confident that the parent company
and unregulated subsidiaries will be shielded from the utility's
bankruptcy case.


PG&amp;E chief financial officer Peter Darbee said the parent
company followed all the state's rules governing the relationship
between holding companies and regulated utilities.


The California Public Utilities Commission is not so sure. Three
days before the bankruptcy filing, the regulators opened an
investigation into whether the parent company illegally took the
utility's money or shirked its responsibility to assure the utility
had adequate capital.


The parent company made a move to insulate itself and National
Energy from the utility's financial woes in December when it
received federal regulatory approval to reshuffle its corporate
structure in a maneuver known as ``ringfencing.'' The term refers
to the concept of building a barrier between a company's stable
operations and its high-risk ones.


The walls separating the utility from the parent and other
subsidiaries are, paradoxically, an offshoot of the deregulation
law.


At the time, regulators ordered PG&amp;E to splinter into distinct
companies to protect the then-rich utility in case something went
awry at the parent company or the unregulated businesses.

States say federal government needs to act to stem energy crisis



By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
BOISE, Idaho (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A six-hour brainstorming session between
federal and state energy regulators ended with a clear message:
Western states want more help from Washington to corral the
region's deepening power crisis.


The three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
flew to Idaho for what Chairman Curtis Hebert called ``frank
discussions'' with officials from 11 Western states about the
astronomical electricity prices that have spread from California to
almost every corner of the region.


And the Washington regulators got an earful.


``Montana is taking a hell of a hit because of this market,''
declared Gary Feland, whose job it is to approve requests by the
state's utilities to pass wholesale price increases on to their
retail customers.


``Politically we're getting beat up,'' added Feland.


In many states, retail electricity sales are still regulated,
but wholesale markets are not. The state officials warned that many
of the electricity rate increases, stemming from wholesale price
run-ups, have yet to reach consumers, but will in the coming months
as states have no choice but to approve them.


Much of the discussion focused on whether FERC, which regulates
the wholesale power market, should temporarily impose price
controls to ease the impact of what one of the commissioners,
William Massey, called ``a looming disaster'' this summer if
nothing more is done.


Afterward, Hebert tallied up the results: Five states opposed
such controls, three wanted them desperately and three others were
not sure. Previously, the latter three had lined up in the ``no''
column.


Hebert has made clear his opposition to renewed price regulation
_ even temporarily to address an emergency _ because he argues that
a free market is the only way to get people to build more power
plants and transmission lines and create the ``price signal'' to
foster conservation.


His position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a
telephone interview with the Associated Press in Olympia,
Washington.


``The problem with price caps is that they don't solve the
problem,'' said Cheney. ``Just look at California, where they had
caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement
to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&amp;E into bankruptcy.''


Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, California's largest utility, said last
week it had debts of dlrs 9 billion and filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.


Like the state officials, FERC is deeply split on the issue of
price controls.


``It is wrong to put the entire Western economy in harm's way
solely to protect a price signal arising from a dysfunctional
market,'' Massey said. ``Our passion for the market must be
tempered with commonsense.''


A contingent from California submitted a proposal calling for
cost-based price caps for 18 months on wholesale electricity and
natural gas sales across the West. Only FERC can impose such caps.


``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' Bob Herzberg,
speaker of California's Assembly, told the three FERC
commissioners. The Californians listed the state's response to its
power problems so far: Actions to boost conservation, increase
retails electricity rates and speed up power plant construction.
Still, they bemoaned that California this year was expected to
spend dlrs 65 billion on electricity, nearly 10 times its power
bill in 1999.


Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to
ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action
to seek dlrs 124 million in refunds on California power sales. He
also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of
tracking market abuses.


Officials from Washington state and Oregon joined California in
the plea for temporary price regulation. The Northwest has been hit
by a severe drought, making less hydro-generated electricity
available and forcing greater reliance on the high-priced spot
market. On Monday the Bonneville Power Authority said it may have
to nearly triple what it charges for its power if demand doesn't
drop sharply and reduce the need of spot market purchases.


In a surprising development, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico said
they no longer were sure that price controls would be such a bad
thing. And even those opposed to price caps, like Montana's Feland,
criticized FERC for not being more aggressive in challenging prices
_ many of them now 10 times what they were a year ago _ as
unreasonable.
