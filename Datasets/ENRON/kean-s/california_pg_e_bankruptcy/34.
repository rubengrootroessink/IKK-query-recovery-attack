Subject: Early Sacramento Reaction to PG&E Plan of Reorganization


Since the POR was filed, we've had many conversations with State legislator=
s, key staffers, legal advisors and members of the inner circle of the Gove=
rnor's energy team.  While the cumulative reaction has been generally negat=
ive, it has been reasonably restrained at the same time.  The Company and w=
e strongly recommended that no one at the State draw any lines in the sand =
until we (Company/creditors) have had a chance to explain why the POR makes=
 sense and why it will succeed in spite of State objections to the contrary=
.
=20
The State issues break down into three categories:  public policy, regulato=
ry and statutory.=20
=20
Public Policy=20
=20
The POR is an affront to State officials who feel that the State went out o=
f its way in AB1x to bolster up noncreditworthy IOU's by providing an alter=
native means to buy power when no one would deal with the IOU's themselves.=
   In response to that move, they see PG&E (1) pulling things out of PUC ju=
risdiction, where they have been forever; and (2) doing so while also quest=
ioning the DWR revenue requirements, thus putting a chilling effect on the =
AB1x bond deal.  These twin acts have understandably spawned a bitter "this=
 is thanks we get?" response from a number of State officials. =20
=20
The State can see why the POR is attractive to the Company and the creditor=
s.  At the same time, they think that it is a very bad plan for consumers. =
 Notwithstanding public comments by the Company to the contrary, they feel =
sure that somehow the POR will result in increased rates.
=20
Unlike the SCE legislation, they don't see the POR giving generators the ha=
ircut "they deserve."  They understand that the generators will only get "a=
llowed claims," but do not view that as sufficient "punishment" for gouging=
 the public.
=20
There is concern that if GenCo goes under FERC jurisdiction, the stage will=
 be set down the road for sale of the hydro assets to a third party ("Enron=
," for example).  Such a transfer will put valuable generating assets in th=
e hands of a third party that has no accountability to the State.
=20
Finally, they are worried that SCE might find the POR attractive and file t=
hemselves, thereby mooting months worth of legislative effort.
=20
Regulatory
=20
Citing various PUC determinations from the past, certain State officials fe=
el that the POR contravenes State regulations (1) against using operating c=
ash to pay undercollections; (2) that mandate that any transfer of assets f=
irst get PUC approval; and (3) that realized value from the transfer of ass=
ets goes to the ratepayer, not the utility.  Begging the question of whethe=
r or not there is a true "transfer" of assets, none of these arguments take=
 into account federal preemption, which is, of course, the key to the whole=
 Plan.
=20
Statutory
=20
AB6x passed earlier this year puts a moratorium on the transfer of IOU asse=
ts for five years.  As before, focusing on this legislation ignores the pre=
emption issue.
=20
Specific Stakeholder Responses
=20
Of the various State parties voicing concern, the PUC, as expected, is the =
most vocal.  While they have expressed outrage and are expected to fight th=
e POR tooth and nail, it is worth noting that their counsel had remarks in =
the SF Chronicle were at worst neutral.  The Governor is studying the plan =
and has thus far been measured in his response.  Given his penchant for tak=
ing firm positions when he disagrees with something (and with the caveat th=
at this may be the calm before the storm), his comments suggest that he may=
 have at least some concern that the POR has legs.   A number of the legisl=
ators share the concerns set forth above, but have confined their public co=
mments to the possibility that rates will rise.  A couple of their key advi=
sors (bankruptcy counsel and CSFB), though, have preliminarily noted that t=
he Plan has a number of "clever" and "attractive" features.  That isn't to =
say they buy off on the Plan, but by not denouncing it up front (indeed, th=
e contrary has been true), they have helped get the State stakeholders to m=
oderate their responses pending further review.   Lastly, the consumer grou=
ps are totally opposed to the POR and remain convinced that they will get s=
tuck in the end with major rate increases.
=20
The net effect of all this at the State level (at least, among the leadersh=
ip) is an even greater sense of urgency to get something done for SCE.  Tha=
t, of course, is much easier said than done (see today's LA Times article o=
n page one of the California section outlining the major rift between the G=
overnor and Senator Burton).  Given that the PG&E bankruptcy has not been t=
he disaster anticipated either from the standpoint of service to users or e=
conomically (PG&E parent stock has fared much better than Edison parent sto=
ck since PG&E filed on April 6), an increasing number of legislators ask th=
emselves "why should we stick our necks out to protect SCE?" and "maybe ban=
kruptcy isn't such a bad thing after all."  So we'll see.  The Governor's t=
hird extraordinary session is due to start sometime soon.  We'll be keeping=
 a close eye on that.
=20
In the meantime, we are going to continue our discussions with the State.  =
We are coordinating those discussions with the Company, to make sure we're =
on the same page.  The goal remains to get the State to see the wisdom of t=
he Plan and to minimize their opposition to the greatest extent possible.  =
I'll keep you posted...
