Dear Steve,

Please find enclosed a note on the results of the Upper House election held here in Japan on July 29. 

In a nutshell, there were no real surprises. The ruling coalition achieved a comfortable majority of 12 seats, for a total of 136 seats, in the 247 seat chamber. 

I'd be happy to put together a more detailed analysis if needed.

Yours,
