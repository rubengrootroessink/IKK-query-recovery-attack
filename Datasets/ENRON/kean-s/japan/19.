Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  it appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect, but nothing has progressed to executive management or 
board approval.   We are using the following statement to respond to media 
inquiries:


Enron and its affiliates, including E Power, continuously look at a number of 
projects around the world.  There is a good deal of advance preparation and 
various factors that need to be evaluated before these projects can progress 
forward through approvals.  Therefore, it is Enron's practice not to comment 
on these projects until they reach a sufficiently advanced stage of 
development to have a significant prospect for success.  Enron and/or E Power 
do not have a power project in Japan which is sufficiently advanced to 
warrant comment at this time.

We will keep you apprised of further significant developments.
