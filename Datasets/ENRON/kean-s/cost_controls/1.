Suzanne  -- here is a summary of our headcount by group from 98 to 2001 (plan)

There is some verbage discussion about major business changes that have had 
an effect, and also we attached 2 graphs which show the Huge increase in the 
number of new deals (from the introduction of EOL in fall of 1999).  1000% 
for Gas and 500% for all products on an average basis, which would certainly 
account for a level of headcount growth, which we believe has been minimal in 
relation to the huge growth in transactions and commodities since 1999

Hopefully, this will help you answer the questions.  I am happy to discuss 
any other info we can provide or slice the info a different way, if 
necessary.  Just let me know.

Beth
