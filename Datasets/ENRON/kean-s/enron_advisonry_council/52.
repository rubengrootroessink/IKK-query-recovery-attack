I INFORMALLY SOUNDED PAUL OUT, AND HE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IF THE DATES WORK.
Possible letter to Paul Joskow from Ken Lay
Dear Paul:
    As you may have heard, Enron has an advisory committee consisting of
leaders in the academic and business communities (list attached). This
committee meets twice each year, along with invited speakers on subjects of
interest to Enron. Top executives of our company do their best to attend.
    Starting on the afternoon of October 30, and concluding late in the day
on October 31, we will be meeting in London. I was most impressed with your
presentation at the Aspen Institute energy forum, and am hoping that you
might consider joining our meeting to discuss "Where do we go from here: how
to preserve the momentum of deregulation after California."
    We would be delighted to cover business class travel costs and all other
expenses incident to your trip to London, including hotel costs should you
choose to extend your stay for several days. In addition, there would be an
honorarium of $XXXXXX.
    Do try to join us: you will find the other speakers interesting, and
London a delightful place in which to spend a bit of time. And we would
benefit enormously from your participation.
                                                      Sincerely,
