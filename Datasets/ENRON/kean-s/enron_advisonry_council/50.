Steve,

Thought you would be interested in learning that the HBS event in Madrid which Pankaj Ghemawat was organising has now been postponed.  John Thompson had planned to participate from Enron and I believe will likely do so once we have a new date from Pankaj.

Thanks,
Fiona

Dear Barbara,

Thanks very much for trying multiple methods to reach me.  As it so 
happens, given the economic slowdown, people?s reluctance to travel et 
cetera, the decision was taken this morning to postpone the Harvard-IESE 
program.  So while we remain very interested in having Mr. Thompson or some 
other senior manager from Enron comment on the discussion of the Enron case 
(which I wrote), the session is in the process of getting 
rescheduled.  I?ll get back in touch as soon as we have a new date.

Thanks again.

Pankaj
