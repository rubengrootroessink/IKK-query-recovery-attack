Attached is a list of additional names, we may wish to consider for the Campaign Director role. This background information will provide you with a good idea of some quality people in the market. Again both (D) and (R) are included. 

Let me know if any are appealing and we can secure additional data on them. Thanks 

Have a good weekend.
