How are we handling these now?  Last time I talked to Jeff, we weren't going 
to lift the restrictions until next week (assuming we do lift the 
restrictions).  Any word?

Steve/ Cindy

Just want to state a case for this move, (before everyone starts up on the 
movement moratorium issues surronding the " EI" companies -which I understand 
is still in place).

Stella Chan (Director level) is one of 6 expats Apachi have seconded into our 
SK Enron JV in Korea. Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell 
Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, 
some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its 
worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the 
moves/replacements.

Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is 
that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 
'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, 
and so the move should go ahead.

Hope you concur.

Darrell,

Stella Chan's contract will conclude March 1 2001. She had shown some desire 
to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she 
has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set 
a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.

This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please 
pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
next step with both individuals.

Thanks


Tony
