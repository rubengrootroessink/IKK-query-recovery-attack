Dear Rice Team:

Thanks to each of you for your help this season.  As many of you know, this 
past Super Saturday was quite a success! 

I have included a list of the 8 candidates in attendance this past weekend.  
The remaining candidates will be included for Super Saturday on December 9.  

Unfortunately, 3 out of the 8 candidates will not receive offers.  I have 
indicated them in gray.

I have personally called all 8 candidates to inform them of their offer 
status.

Thanks again for all your help!  Please feel free to call and congratulate 
these superstars!
