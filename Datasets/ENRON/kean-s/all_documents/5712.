The first meeting relative to the SB 27x fix to the suspension of da 
contained in AB 1x was held at the Capitol today.  Present were ESPs, 
consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from 
the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel.  The meeting 
was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office.

Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition 
proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted 
either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be 
discussed in tomorrow's conference call.

Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was 
the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance.  He 
expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential 
and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will 
make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds.  

We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their 
fears- the sooner the better.  We need to be able to speak their language on 
bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in 
terms relavant to their bonding requirements.  We can discuss this further in 
the call tomorow.

Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek 
next.  The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we 
have our work cut out for us.

Until tomorrow.
