$18 billion power tab projected: An immediate outcry greets Davis' plan for=
=20
state energy purchases through June 2002.
By Emily Bazar and Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 1, 2001)=20
Seeking to sell his energy rescue plan to reluctant Republicans, Gov. Gray=
=20
Davis on Monday released a long-awaited financial plan that shows the state=
=20
will spend more than $18 billion on electricity through June 2002, but can=
=20
maneuver the energy crisis without additional rate increases or draining th=
e=20
state budget.=20
His projections, however, were immediately attacked by lawmakers and indust=
ry=20
experts, who called them overly optimistic and unrealistic.=20
The plan, which Davis is using to bolster his energy effort with legislator=
s=20
and Wall Street, is based on a series of assumptions, among them that the=
=20
state will pay significantly less for electricity on the spot market during=
=20
the hottest summer months than it pays now, and that dozens of shuttered=20
small generators will start selling discount electricity again.=20
"No one has a crystal ball into the future," state Treasurer Phil Angelides=
=20
told reporters. "The administration's plan makes some assumptions, as any=
=20
plan must. The question is, are they reasonable assumptions, and what do we=
=20
need to do collectively to make the plan succeed?"=20
The Democratic governor has long faced criticism for refusing to divulge=20
details about the state's power purchases, both on the expensive spot marke=
t=20
and under long-term contracts.=20
Last week, the issue was thrust into the forefront when Assembly Republican=
s=20
told the governor they would not vote for a bill authorizing the sale of $1=
0=20
billion in revenue bonds to pay for the state's power purchases until they=
=20
received additional information.=20
If legislators don't pass the bill -- which requires a two-thirds majority=
=20
and, therefore, Republican votes -- Angelides said the state might miss a M=
ay=20
8 deadline for closing on a crucial $4.1 billion bridge loan.=20
On Monday, Davis relented, releasing his response in the form of an=20
inch-thick document filled with tables, bar graphs and projections. The pla=
n=20
gives the first detailed, month-by-month account of the state Department of=
=20
Water Resources' expected power purchases through 2002.=20
But the projections failed to win votes immediately in the Assembly=20
Republican caucus, where Minority Floor Leader Dave Cox said he is not yet=
=20
ready to support the proposed $10 billion in bonds. The caucus will meet=20
today to decide what to do next, he said.=20
"Many of the assumptions are questionable and there is no answer as to what=
=20
will happen if the assumptions prove incorrect," said Assemblyman Keith=20
Richman, R-Sun Valley. "I'm very concerned."=20
Davis' plan relies on numerous estimates, including likely summer=20
temperatures and annual rainfall, and an assumption that Californians will=
=20
use 7 percent less energy this year than they did last year.=20
Private consultants who helped draft the plan also predicted that most of t=
he=20
small generators that stopped producing electricity because they hadn't bee=
n=20
paid for months will resume production at discounted rates. They argued tha=
t=20
their assumptions are conservative and allow for unexpected changes.=20
"There are lots of variables that are not simply assumptions," said Joseph=
=20
Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City and a=20
consultant to the administration. "I would say probably 80 percent is what =
we=20
know are facts and 20 percent are expectations."=20
Republican lawmakers and others were particularly uncomfortable with the=20
administration's conclusion that the state will spend an average of $195 pe=

megawatt-hour for electricity on the spot market in July, August and=20
September, the hottest months of the year when electricity is expected to b=
e=20
sold at a premium.=20
Some have predicted that the costs could go much higher.=20
"There's a reasonable chance this summer that the state will be paying $1=
=20
billion per week" for electricity, Severin Borenstein, head of the Universi=
ty=20
of California Energy Institute, told state regulators last week.=20
With summer prices forecast to be $500 to $700 per megawatt-hour, and the=

state Department of Water Resources expected to need more than 200,000=20
megawatt-hours a day, it would be easy to rack up billion-dollar power bill=
s,=20
he said in an interview.=20
The state spent $90 million on power on a single day last week, but prices=
=20
declined somewhat afterward, according to the governor's press office.=20
Davis' Cabinet secretary, Susan Kennedy, defended the estimated summertime=
=20
cost, saying the state has secured enough long-term contracts to limit its=
=20
exposure to the most expensive spot market prices.=20
"It's almost impossible to say what's plausible and what isn't," said Mike=
=20
Florio, an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a Bay Area consumer=20
group.=20
It makes sense that power costs, overall, would drop as more long-term=20
contracts kick in and the state buys less electricity on the spot market, h=
e=20
said. But many of those contracts are still being negotiated.=20
"What this assumes about contracts that have not been signed is the really=
=20
interesting question," he said.=20
Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the Davis administration=

hasn't been able to provide assurances that if bonds are sold now, more won=

"Their assumptions are nothing more than educated guesses," Strickland said=

"And the educated guess of the Legislature was that we wouldn't be in the=

Kennedy conceded that the administration's plan has its limits, and won't=

prevent the state from experiencing rolling blackouts in the coming months =

PUC seeks to retain PG&E control=20
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 1, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Warning that California consumers and the state economy=20
could be in grave danger, the state Public Utilities Commission urged a=20
federal bankruptcy judge Monday not to sever the commission's regulatory=20
control of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=20
On April 9, three days after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,=
=20
PG&E petitioned the Bankruptcy Court to block parts of a recent PUC order.=
=20
PG&E said the provisions conflicted with bankruptcy rules and interfered wi=
th=20
its legal right to recover skyrocketing wholesale energy coasts.=20
The provisions at issue -- adopted by the PUC on March 27 along with a 30=
=20
percent rate increase -- imposed new accounting requirements on the=20
utilities, but the consequences were potentially dramatic. Depending on the=
=20
way certain costs are counted, PG&E may or may not be entitled to early=20
termination of an electricity rate freeze adopted by the Legislature five=
=20
years ago.=20
PG&E said the accounting provisions changed the rules retroactively and=20
artificially extended the rate freeze.=20
But the PUC disagreed -- and said the issue is even larger. In a series of=
=20
documents filed Monday, the commission characterized PG&E's petition as "th=
e=20
first step in (the company's) plan to deregulate itself." If PG&E succeeds =
in=20
stripping California of its power to regulate its electric utilities, the=
=20
commission said, "PG&E may be able to claim an artificial end to the rate=
=20
freeze, which could result in drastically higher retail electric rates. The=
=20
harm to California's consumers and economy could be grave."=20
The commission said that the petition should be dismissed on grounds of=20
"sovereign immunity" -- the state's right not to be sued by private parties=
=20
-- and because the nation's bankruptcy laws bar interference with the state=
's=20
exercise of its regulatory powers.=20
"The accounting proposal the commission adopted was illegal before we filed=
=20
for Chapter 11," PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Monday. "Now that we are in=20
Chapter 11, it not only affects our shareholders, it also impacts our=20
creditors."=20

Legislators propose tax on energy profits=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 1, 2001)=20
With power producers reaping profits that increased fivefold last year, som=
e=20
state lawmakers are pushing a tax on future earnings as the best way to kee=
p=20
generators honest.=20
California would recoup 100 percent of power profits deemed unreasonable=20
through a "windfall profits tax" proposed by state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona=
.=20
Her bill, SB 1x, cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday on a=
=20
7-3 vote.=20
The proposal would force generators to give the state any money collected=
=20
above a reasonable limit determined by the state Public Utilities Commissio=
n.=20
That money probably would be doled out in equal portions to state taxpayers=
,=20
possibly through income tax returns, though details remain vague.=20
The bill is aimed principally at five out-of-state companies -- AES Corp.,=
=20
Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant and Reliant -- that bought Californi=
a=20
power plants under deregulation and saw profits increase last year at an=20
average of 508 percent, according to Democratic estimates.=20
"What this bill says is, 'You can't come in and rip us off,' " said Senate=
=20
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.=20
Critics said the proposal would only discourage companies from building new=
=20
power plants in California or producing power when the state needs it most.=
=20
During the worst of California's energy blues, utilities and the state have=
=20
paid generators and marketers well above 30 cents per kilowatt-hour.=20
Soto has suggested an 8 cents a kilowatt-hour cap, meaning that any price=
=20
charged above that would be considered unreasonable. If a generator were to=
=20
charge 30 cents, for instance, it would have to return 22 cents to the stat=
e=20
in the form of the new tax.=20
Although the proposal could have the direct effect of knocking down soaring=
=20
energy prices, it would also send a message that the state will not tolerat=
e=20
price gouging, some lawmakers said.=20
"We have been royally mistreated," said Sen. Jack Scott, D-Altadena, a=20
co-author of the bill. "And we have allowed a great deal of California mone=
y=20
to leave the state at the expense of ratepayers, taxpayers and businesses."=
=20
But energy producers challenged the bill, saying it would simply discourage=
=20
companies from building plants in California or from upgrading existing=20
facilities.=20
The tax "does nothing to solve the fundamental problem in California, and=
=20
that's mainly the lack of supply," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for=
=20
Houston-based Reliant.=20
"There is no way, given natural-gas prices today, that we could make any=20
money under the price caps in this bill," said Carl London, a lobbyist for=
=20
InterGen, a Boston-based generator.=20
In turn, the state's businesses would suffer through sustained power=20
blackouts because supply would remain low, said Carrie Lee-Coke, general=20
counsel of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.=20
"There is one simple truth, and that is there is too little energy=20
production," Lee-Coke said, calling Soto's bill the "wrong medicine" for=20
California.=20
Although electricity generated in California would be affected, it is uncle=
ar=20
whether the state can legally impose restrictions on power from outside the=
=20
state.=20
Republicans on Monday opposed the plan, citing disincentives for power=20
companies to boost supply and resultant blackouts. But the bill needs suppo=

only from majority Democrats to pass.=20
"The economic reality is that the people cannot afford to be gouged any=20

Dan Walters: Davis finally generates an energy plan, but will it work?


(Published May 1, 2001)=20
After months of issuing buzzwords, sound bites and bold predictions that=20
proved wrong, Gov. Gray Davis finally unveiled Monday what aides said was a=
=20
comprehensive plan to shepherd California through the energy crisis.=20
The thick compendium of charts, tables and narrative, prepared by a financi=
al=20
consulting firm and peddled to legislators and journalists by a squad of=20
administration aides, was designed to bolster Davis' case for legislative=
=20
approval of a $12.5 billion bond issue. About half the money would repay th=
e=20
state's beleaguered general fund, which has been drained for power purchase=
s,=20
and the rest would ease the impact on ratepayers' bills for future power=20
purchases.=20
Administration officials insisted it is a realistic scheme based on=20
reasonable assumptions -- but legislators of both parties remained skeptica=
l=20
since the governor's previous assumptions and projections about the crisis=
=20
had proved to be uniformly wrong. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether=
=20
the bond issue bill that the administration says is vital will win=20
legislative approval this week -- at least in the size Davis is seeking. Ev=
en=20
Democrats are wary.=20
Legislative analysts zeroed in on a couple of assumptions that are central =
to=20
the workability of the plan:=20
That Californians will severely curtail their energy use this summer in=20
response to supply shortages, a big ad campaign and sharp price increases.=
=20
That the state can buy spot market power this summer at rates far below wha=
t=20
it has been paying and what the power futures market indicates will be the=
=20
summer spot price.=20
If either of those two assumptions is off the mark, the state could face=20
severe and prolonged blackouts and/or could go billions of dollars deeper=
=20
into debt.=20
Administration aides insisted that their assumptions are reasonable, based =
on=20
what is known now about power consumption habits and the availability and=
=20
price of power for the summer, when demand usually rises sharply to run air=
=20
conditioning.=20
"This is not a guess," Susan Kennedy, a top Davis aide, told reporters in=
=20
response to sharp questioning about the plan's projection of making spot=20
market power purchases during the summer at an average of $195 per=20
megawatt-hour, 40 percent less than what the state is paying now. The curre=
nt=20
futures market price for California-delivered power in July and August is=
=20
about $500 per megawatt-hour, but administration officials insist they have=
=20
contracted for much of the summer peak load at lower costs, leaving less=20
exposure to the spot market.=20
If it all works as Davis hopes, customers of the three major utilities --=
=20
about 70 percent of Californians -- will see a sharp boost in their rates=
=20
soon, and that will be enough to finance the $20 billion in power purchase=
=20
debts incurred by the utilities and the state so far, plus pay for future=
=20
purchases.=20
The bonds would pick up the costs not covered by the raised rates in the=20
early years of the scheme, then be paid off later as rates remain high but=
=20
power costs go down. A sharp decline in power costs later in the decade is=
=20
another major assumption in Davis' plan, based on still another assumption=
=20
that massive generating facilities will be built within a few years.=20
The administration's new set of assumptions replaces suppositions that prov=
ed=20
to be very wrong, such as Davis' oft-expressed belief that power rates woul=
d=20
not have to be raised. And the new scheme also includes elements that Davis=
=20
had rejected last year, such as long-term contracting for power and the=20
ability of rate increases to drive down consumption.=20
Will it work? Will ratepayers, taxpayers, voters, financiers, legislators a=
nd=20
others be persuaded that Davis finally has his act together and that his=20
scheme is workable and fair? And will consumer activists be placated by a=
=20
plan that assumes ratepayers will shoulder the utilities' massive debts? St=
ay=20
tuned. This crisis is still a long way from being a footnote to California=
=20
history.=20

Soaring energy bills hurt eateries: Many restaurants in capital area, despi=
te=20
good patronage, expect to raise menu prices.=20
By Cathleen Ferraro
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 1, 2001)=20
So far, it appears to be the economic slump that wasn't.=20
Across the region, most restaurateurs say they aren't seeing patrons pull=
=20
back on how often they eat out or what they order. That's significant becau=
se=20
dining out is one of the first luxuries people typically eliminate when tim=
es=20
get rough -- or even appear to be slowing down.=20
At the same time, restaurant owners who say business is good remain anxious=
=20
about the relentless energy crisis. They complain about big utility bills=
=20
that promise to stay bloated through the summer and about higher operating=
=20
costs from vendors now passing along their own inflated energy expenses.=20
That all adds up to pricier menus.=20
"I hoped not to increase prices, but there's no slack when basic utilities=
=20
are so high now," said Barbara Mikacich, owner of Sacramento's Andiamo=20
restaurant, which expects to come out with a new menu in June.=20
With a few exceptions, local bakery cafes, pizza shops, swanky steakhouses=
=20
and more are about to raise food prices while trying to cut back on energy=
=20
use. Restaurants are taking such steps because they're bracing for more=20
energy problems and fear that the economic downturn -- while not obvious no=
w=20
-- could be around the corner.=20
"We're watching all the little things," said Mark Platt, operating partner =
at=20
P.F. Chang's China Bistro in Roseville where sales are still strong. "But=
=20
there's no dramatic way for us to save on our use of gas here. We have to u=
se=20
woks."=20
No menu price hikes or staff layoffs are in the wind at P.F. Chang's, Platt=
=20
said. But the popular restaurant has changed some of its routine tasks to=
=20
offset gas and electric utility bills that have climbed from a combined=20
$12,500 a month when it opened in September to $16,000 now.=20
So each morning, cooks at P.F. Chang's no longer spend 20 minutes over=20
gas-fired flames removing carbon from the bottom of nine main woks. Now the=
y=20
get the job done in five minutes.=20
Meanwhile, the restaurant's timers have been adjusted so that lights and ai=
r=20
conditioners turn on later in the day and shut off sooner.=20
Elsewhere in Roseville, Carvers Steaks & Chops -- traditionally a lunchtime=
=20
hot spot with developers, bankers and other professionals -- stopped using=
=20
its five gas fireplaces.=20
"We used to run them from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., six days a week," said genera=
l=20
manager Gary Kowalsky. "But we quit lighting them because they're strictly=
=20
for ambience."=20
Prompting that change is Carvers' combined utility bill. It used to run=20
$6,000 a month but has jumped to $10,000.=20
No layoffs are planned at Carvers. Menu price hikes took effect six weeks a=
go=20
when the restaurant added 50 cents to $1 to the prices for steak dishes.=20
At Casey's Bakery & Cafe on Sacramento's Folsom Boulevard, the gas bill has=
=20
doubled since February, said owner Casey Hayden. So instead of running=20
convection ovens "all day long," as he put it, the shop organizes jobs now =
so=20
that more pastries and desserts bake at the same time, reducing use of the=
=20
cafe's gas ovens.=20
In mid-March, Casey's reduced its operating hours from six days a week down=
=20
to just three, Friday through Sunday, in response to the energy crunch,=20

Empowering the public
Obstacles keep cities out of energy


(Published April 30, 2001)

In a city the size of Davis, how many citizens does it take to kill an=20
initiative to create a public power agency and remove PG&E as the supplier =
of=20
electricity? Only three. That's because, under state law, a five-member=20
government agency, the county Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO),=20
which operates largely in obscurity, can reject the proposal before it even=
=20
gets to the ballot box.=20
Over the past several decades, laws such as this have made it harder for=20
communities to leave the domain of the investor-owned utilities and turn=20
power into a public enterprise. Sacramento's long struggle to create its=20
municipal utility district (SMUD) began in the 1920s. It took two decades o=
f=20
fighting a resistant PG&E for SMUD to get into the distribution business. I=
f=20
today's laws were in effect back then, Sacramentans might still be fighting=
,=20
or have given up long ago.=20
Amid the pile of energy-related legislation in the capitol is one that seek=
s=20
to remove these roadblocks to public power. At the heart of SB 23x by Sens.=
=20
Nell Soto of Pomona and John Burton of San Francisco are two valuable=20
reforms. If the private utilities don't manage to kill this bill, the futur=
e=20
will provide interesting choices for communities that are beginning to asse=
ss=20
their energy options.=20
The first reform in SB 23x would be to prevent LAFCOs from blocking electio=
ns=20
to decide whether to create a public power agency. LAFCOs now hold this vet=
o=20
power. This is how residents in and around the city of Davis were prevented=
=20
last year from voting on a public power initiative on the ballot. They had=
=20
thousands of signatures on their initiative petitions. But they didn't have=
=20
three votes on LAFCO. SB 23x would give LAFCO an advisory role, so that=20
voters can take their findings into consideration.=20
The second reform would change what happens when a newly formed public powe=
r=20
agency decides to purchase the local electric distribution lines from PG&E.=
 A=20
law passed in the early 1990s gave PG&E considerable leverage in court to=
=20
challenge whether it's necessary for the municipal utility to buy its wires=
.=20
PG&E seeks to substitute its will for that of the voters. SB 23x returns to=
=20
the municipal utility the legal presumption that it can take over the lines=
,=20
leaving the courts to settle on the appropriate price. This is the proper=
=20
role of the courts.=20
A new municipal utility doesn't necessarily have to buy the lines and get=
=20
into the distribution business. It may simply buy power in bulk and pass on=
=20
the savings to its citizens. The first step is for communities to assess=20
their options. Davis residents are once again mulling secession from PG&E, =
as=20
are activists in Fresno, communities within Orange County and San Francisco=
.=20
It's too soon to say whether these seeds of a modern-day public power=20
movement ultimately come to fruition. Yet the mere threat of secession acts=
=20
as an appropriate check against the investor-owned utilities. Communities a=
re=20
not their hostages. SB 23x returns to communities the power of choice.=20

Daniel Weintraub: An energy trader says it's time to limit profits


(Published May 1, 2001)=20

In a sea of angry finger-pointing, name-calling and ridicule, Keith Bailey=
=20
stands out as an island of calm, a lonely voice of reason who understands=
=20
that a company's long-term self-interest is about more than how much money =
it=20
can make today.=20
Most Californians probably have never heard of Bailey, a Kansas City native=
=20
and chief executive officer of Tulsa-based Williams Cos. -- a private energ=
y=20
trader that has profited handsomely from the state's recent miseries. But=
=20
Golden Staters from Gov. Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma=
=20
resident. He might be the man who saves our future.=20
Bailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary cap=
s=20
on the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall=20
2002, when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might=20
return to the West's energy market.=20
His rationale is this: To save California's private electricity market, new=
=20
power plants are desperately needed. But not enough of those plants will be=
=20
built if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product the=
y=20
already are providing.=20
Californians, though, don't want to promise payment without knowing they wi=
ll=20
be able to afford the bill. Short-term caps on profits, Bailey believes, ar=
e=20
the best way to ease the state's fears, get everybody paid and move on to a=
=20
system that works -- for suppliers and customers.=20
"One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create somethin=
g=20
that California can look at and say, 'So long as prices are determined on=
=20
this basis, we're prepared to pay,' " Bailey said in an interview. "This is=
 a=20
mechanism that lets the state say, 'We're not signing a blank check. We don=
't=20
know what the price is going to be, but we do know how it will be=20
determined.' "=20
Bailey's proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last we=
ek=20
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and far better for Californi=
a.=20
The federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached, would kick =
in=20
only during emergencies and would be focused on prices, not profits. Bailey=
=20
is proposing that all power sold from now through summer 2002 be priced at=
=20
the cost of producing it, plus a profit of 15 percent. That's more than a=
=20
regulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek, and=
=20
far less than electricity providers have been earning of late.=20
Cynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has=
=20
squeezed all it can from California. The firm reported last week that profi=
ts=20
doubled in the first quarter of 2001 over a year ago, with pretax income fr=
om=20
its energy services nearly tripling, to $600 million. Much of the 4,000=20
megawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already=20
committed in long-term contracts -- so Bailey has relatively little to lose=
=20
if what remains can only be sold at controlled prices.=20
But here is at least one measure of Bailey's sincerity: His company still i=
s=20
owed $252 million for electricity it has provided California. And he's not=
=20
insisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect=
,=20
or even as part of the deal.=20
"Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with," he said. "Whether that=
=20
ultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the=20
parties, it will sort itself out one way or another. Perhaps if we find=20
prices that work going forward, that could be used as a framework."=20
Bailey, an engineer by training, says no one should mistake his proposal fo=
r=20
a lack of confidence in free markets. He still firmly believes that a=20
deregulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the=
=20
West in the long term. He just wants to make sure there is a long term.=20
Bailey is watching, and listening, to California. He hears talk of seizing=
=20
power plants, of turning to a public power system. He describes these ideas=
=20
as Draconian and says they would not solve the problem. But he also knows=
=20
there is a limit to what Californians -- and their elected leaders -- can=
=20
take.=20
"I recognize we live in a democracy, and lots of things could happen," he=
=20
said.=20
What he is proposing, in effect, is a safety valve. He wants to limit the=
=20
market in order to save it.=20
"This is an extraordinary situation," Bailey said. "We need to help create=
=20
some breathing room. ... We all have to work together, and this is the righ=

thing to do."=20
Bailey's proposal, made at a conference of energy producers and traders in=

Oklahoma last week, was almost lost amid all the focus on the price caps=20

Monday.
?????The reports show that seven energy companies spent more than $1 millio=

?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said his company racked up hundreds of thousand=

of dollars in expenses in its unsuccessful effort to reach an agreement wit=
h=20
the state on the purchase of its transmission lines. An unprecedented numbe=

of energy-related bills added to PG&E's need to hire lobbyists, Low said.
?????"During the first quarter this year, more than 350 bills were introduc=

?????Sempra Energy, the parent firm of San Diego Gas & Electric, spent=20
$192,000 lobbying lawmakers in Sacramento and regulators at the Public=20

California Energy Commission.
?????Lobbyists hired by the company, according to the report, also spent $6=

Davis Turns to Bankruptcy Court for Help in Plan to Buy Power Grid=20
Utility: He seeks support from panel representing creditors of PG&E. The fi=
rm=20
has rebuffed state's offers.=20

By DAN MORAIN and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Foiled in his first attempt to buy Pacific Gas &=20
Electric's transmission grid, Gov. Gray Davis said Monday that he has tried=
 a=20
new tactic: bypassing the company and attempting to build support for the=
=20
deal in Bankruptcy Court.
?????Davis' plan to buy the grid appeared to have ended disastrously last=
=20
month when the giant utility filed for bankruptcy protection. But Davis sai=
d=20
his advisors now are trying to sell the idea to a committee of PG&E credito=
rs=20
that hold a stake in the utility's Chapter 11 proceeding.
?????The creditors committee, representing the hundreds of companies owed=
=20
money by PG&E, does not by itself hold the power to accept or reject the=20
deal, which Davis sees as a key to his plan to restructure the state's=20
crippled electricity system. But the committee will play an important role =
in=20
any reorganization plan that is ultimately hammered out in U.S. Bankruptcy=
=20
Court.
?????Given that power, Davis sent advisors to brief the committee last=20
Wednesday. The advisors told the committee about the deal they struck with=
=20
Southern California Edison to buy its share of the statewide transmission=
=20
grid, and the similar deal that PG&E rejected.
?????"I'm not saying they embraced it entirely," Davis said, after speaking=
=20
at a conference of technology entrepreneurs put on by the J.P. Morgan=20
investment bank. "But they liked parts of it, asked good questions, and I=
=20
thought it was a good beginning."
?????Paul Aronzon, the lead lawyer for the creditors committee, stressed th=
at=20
the meeting with Davis' advisors would not lead directly to a deal. The=20
governor's representatives "did not come out and say, 'Would you guys sell =
us=20
the transmission grid?' " he said. Rather, Aronzon said, the advisors simpl=
y=20
brought the creditors up to speed on what Davis has put on the table.
?????Davis has offered more than $7 billion to buy the transmission systems=
=20
of Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E. So far, only Edison has=20
accepted the deal. The cash infusion would help the utilities restructure=
=20
their debts, and ultimately relieve the state of the need to continue buyin=
g=20
electricity on their behalf.
?????The Davis administration made public Monday its most detailed breakdow=
n=20
yet on the costs it expects to incur purchasing electricity over the next=
=20
years.
?????However, the extra information failed to satisfy Republican lawmakers,=
=20
who are holding up legislation needed to repay the state budget for the=20
billions already spent on electricity.
?????California will spend $15 billion buying power this year, according to=
=20
projections by Davis' advisors.
?????But that total will drop to $9 billion next year and $7 billion the ne=
xt=20
as long-term electricity contracts, energy conservation efforts and new pow=
er=20
supplies combine to lower the state's costs.
?????With money from higher electric rates and a planned $12.5-billion bond=
,=20
the state should be able to cover the costs of power and operate at a surpl=
us=20
starting in November 2002, the administration projected.
?????Several Republicans took note of the date: It is the month of the 2002=
=20
gubernatorial election, when Davis is expected to seek a second term.
?????The figures were based on a dizzying number of assumptions about the=
=20
state's energy future. The projections assume, for example, that California=
ns=20
will reduce energy consumption by 7%, and that 90% of the state's alternati=
ve=20
energy producers will soon generate electricity again. Now only about 65% a=
re=20
online.
?????Davis administration officials defended the figures, saying that they=
=20
were conservative.
?????The reaction to the figures reflects a growing rift between Democrats=
=20
and Republicans over how best to solve the state's problems. Efforts have=
=20
been lurching unsteadily on several fronts, including the courts, the state=
=20
Legislature and Congress, with considerable political head-butting taking=
=20
place in the last two.
?????In Washington today, a key congressional panel is expected to take up=
=20
emergency legislation intended to help California, although Davis and other=
=20
Democrats have criticized the effort as useless.
?????The bill's 19 provisions would, among other things, provide federal ai=
d=20
to relieve a bottleneck in the state's transmission system, permit governor=
s=20
to obtain temporary waivers of environmental rules to boost power supplies,=
=20
and direct federal disaster officials to help California prepare for=20
blackouts.
?????A spokesman for Davis said the Republican-drafted legislation offers "=
a=20
lot of things we don't need, and fails to address the one thing we do need,=
"=20
namely firm price controls on wholesale electricity sales.
?????Democrats and Republicans have strong, fundamental disagreements about=
=20
how best to solve the crisis, with Democrats supporting price controls, if=
=20
only temporarily, and many Republicans, including President Bush, opposed t=
o=20
tampering with the market.
?????Several Democrats who attended a White House ceremony Monday to mark=
=20
Bush's first 100 days in office spoke briefly to the president about the=20
energy situation.
?????"He was not very sympathetic," said Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), an=
=20
advocate of price controls. "They have their minds pretty well made up."
?????In one effort to seize the initiative, a divided state Senate=20
Appropriations Committee approved a bill Monday that would impose a windfal=
l=20
profits tax on electricity sellers who gouge California consumers. Revenue=
=20
from the tax would flow back to Californians in the form of a credit on the=
ir=20
state income taxes, starting next April 15.
?????"Our backs are to the wall," said one sponsor of the bill, Sen. Jack=

Scott (D-Altadena). "We believe that this is one time when we can stand up =

?????On a 7-3 vote, Democrats on the committee voted for the bill, SB1X, an=

That's because DWR cut long-term contracts covering a major part of the=20

Long-term contracts and conservation will minimize the effect of the expect=

Davis' consultants predict the state can conserve up to 7,234 megawatts=20

Davis' ''20/20'' conservation plan is expected to cut another 2,200 megawat=

``If we're wrong, there are certain reserves built in,'' said Susan Kennedy=

or there will be blackouts, she added, and if the price of power goes highe=
r=20

By the end of 2002, Davis estimates, DWR will spend $26.9 billion to buy=20
power for customers of the three financially ailing utilities. Of that, $12=
.5=20
billion will be paid for by revenue bonds that will add up to one cent per=

The Legislature approved the revenue bonds based on a formula that would se=

City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente, the author of the tax cut=20

Under the revision, low-income residents would be exempt from the tax, whic=

"The mayor has some legitimate concerns," De La Fuente said. He said he wou=

The council's latest move came after Brown last week invoked his authority =
to=20
block legislation, a power he was granted under the 1998 strong-mayor=20
ordinance that he wrote and voters approved.=20
In the letter, Brown said the six-month tax break would take $1.6 million=

from the city coffers and could be construed as a permanent tax cut, which=

"In addition," the mayor wrote, "the current budget hemorrhaging in=20

After the council approved the tax cut last week, city leaders heard a repo=

"We all wanted to do this," said Councilwoman Jane Brunner, referring to=20

Sacramento -- Trying to drum up support to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to=
=20
buy power, a top adviser to Gov. Gray Davis warned lawmakers yesterday of=
=20
"Armageddon" this summer if key assumptions on energy generation and=20
conservation fail to materialize.=20
Presenting a 67-page document to lawmakers, Davis' top energy consultants=
=20
said numerous assumptions -- such as increased conservation and more=20
alternative generating facilities returning to full operation -- must pan=
=20
out.=20
Without that, Davis' Cabinet secretary, Susan Kennedy, said an "Armageddon=
=20
scenario" would take place, according to numerous lawmakers in the meeting.=
=20
That could include more blackouts or additional borrowing, Kennedy said in =
a=20
briefing later with reporters. "Everything has to fall in place."=20
But one key assumption was immediately blasted by an energy industry offici=
al=20
as "completely unrealistic."=20
The administration document forecasts that 90 percent of the state's=20
alternative generators will be back on line by June. About one-third are=20
currently not operating because they are not being paid by California's deb=
t-=20
ridden utilities.=20
"That is complete lunacy at this point," said Jerry Bloom, a spokesman for=
=20
the California Cogeneration Council. "The assumption simply does not reflec=
t=20
the reality of the market. It shows once again that the governor is not=20
listening."=20
Among the other assumptions is a 7 percent conservation rate and the approv=
al=20
of the deal between the state and Southern California Edison Co. for the=20
purchase of the utility's transmission lines. Davis has set a target of=20
conserving 10 percent.=20
In San Francisco yesterday, Davis told a high-tech business conference that=
=20
the state will have to walk a tightrope to get through the summer.=20
"We are going to have to set the Guinness Book of Records in this state in=
=20
order to avoid disruptions this summer," he said.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the assumptions were "fair and rational=
"=20
but warned many of the assumptions are beyond the state's control.=20
"The biggest threat to making this plan work is if generators take prices=
=20
from the current level, which is horrendous, to obscenely horrendous," he=
=20
said after meeting with Assembly Republicans for an hour on the proposed bo=
nd=20
sale.=20
The dire scenarios were used by the administration officials to convince=20
Assembly Republicans to approve a bond authorization, which is scheduled to=
=20
come up for a vote on Thursday.=20
GOP members balked at approving the huge bond issuance without further=20
details from the administration. But yesterday's information simply raised=
=20
more questions in many minds.=20
"It's kind of like peeling back an onion -- as you peel something back you=
=20
find something else out," said Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster.=20
Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said Republicans want to be=
=20
sure there won't be a continuing need to issue larger amounts of bonds in t=
he=20
future.=20
"The governor's office is asking us to approve the biggest bond in American=
=20
history, and we're just supposed to trust them on a lot of this stuff," he=
=20
said. "What happens if the assumptions don't happen? Do we need another $7=
=20
billion or $10 billion in loans? Is the existing rate structure enough or=
=20
will they ask for more? We want to know."=20
Republican votes are needed to approve the bond issuing authority on an=20
urgency basis.=20
The current bill only allows for $10 billion, but the administration now sa=
ys=20
it needs $12.5 billion. Kennedy said another request for more financing wil=
l=20
be made later to close that gap.=20
The predictions use the rate increase proposed by Davis, which averages abo=
ut=20
37 percent. His rate increase would pay off not only the revenue bond issue=
d=20
by the state, but also a $8 billion bond issued by the utilities to pay off=
=20
some of their back debt.=20
Angelides has pressed for the bonding authority because the commitments for=
=20
short-term bridge loans -- which would provide the state with money during=

Leadership blackout
Gov. Davis seems unplugged in dealing with the crisis=20
April 29, 2001
By Steven Greenhut
The Orange County Register
We've seen it a bazillion times on TV and in the movies. A crisis threatens=
 a=20
family, a community, a nation. Perhaps the threat comes from an enemy durin=
g=20
wartime. Or from a gang of criminals, corporate polluters, corrupt governme=
nt=20
officials or aliens from Mars.=20
Out of nowhere, someone - sometimes from the least expected place - steps t=
o=20
the plate. It's not just in the movies. History books are filled with the=
=20
likes of George Washington, Winston Churchill, Lech Walesa. People who seiz=
ed=20
the moment and made it their own; people who chose to lead - and worry abou=
t=20
the consequences later.
History books are filled, also, with those who ducked for cover, pointed=20
fingers or ran away.
No one would have believed it, but in spring 2001 the nation's most populou=
s=20
state is struggling with looming blackouts, soaring electricity rates, stat=
e=20
legislators blustering about Evil Power Producers and proposing "solutions"=
=20
that lost credence when the Berlin Wall fell. And rather than lead, the man=
=20
on the hot seat has become angry, immobile. He stands there, yelling "It's=
=20
not my fault," and waiting for the mess to evaporate.
Most Californians sympathize with Gov. Gray Davis, who just a few months ag=
o=20
was viewed as an inevitable presidential contender. We know he didn't creat=
e=20
the current mess.
But it's Davis' moment, nonetheless. One would have thought the man who spe=
nt=20
his career plotting his rise to the governor's office would have had some=
=20
underlying reason for aspiring to the post. Anyone can be a leader when=20
there's nothing to do but spend a surplus. But the real test comes when the=
=20
chips are down.
No one should pin their hopes on politicians. Typically, pols should tend t=
o=20
the administrative affairs of government and let a free people live free=20
lives. But the electricity imbroglio is a government-created mess that=20
initially requires a government solution.
After all, we're talking about highly regulated utilities. It is a botched=
=20
state de-regulation plan - actually a re-regulation plan - that exacerbated=
=20
the energy problems. And it has been the state's unwillingness to allow pow=
er=20
generators to build plants that has added to supply shortfalls.
There are two directions to choose: Toward a system owned and operated by t=
he=20
state government, or toward a market-based system that treats electricity=
=20
like any other commodity. The price of natural gas, food, clothing and othe=
r=20
essentials are allowed to rise and fall, according to the marketplace.
Why is electricity so holy?
If prices are allowed to float, and generators are allowed to provide the=
=20
juice to fill demand, soon enough a competitive market will overtake the=20
initial price jumps and force prices down again. Sen. Tom McClintock,=20
R-Thousand Oaks, one of the few rational voices in Sacramento, argues that=
=20
Davis should have returned the surplus to taxpayers, who would have then ha=
d=20
the means to pay for the initial price spikes.
Instead, Davis has spent the surplus buying electricity, allowing taxpayers=
=20
to foot the bill because he refuses to allow customers (Aren't they the sam=
e=20
people?) to pay market prices. Adding insult to injury, he refuses to make=
=20
his dealings public.
Furthermore, Davis could have stabilized the situation last year when leade=
rs=20
of the state's utilities tried in vain to get his attention about looming=
=20
problems and to urge limited price increases and use of long-term contracts=
=20
to buy power. Instead, Davis and his handpicked political crony who runs th=
e=20
Public Utilities Commission did nothing - except let a problem spiral into =
a=20
full-blown crisis.=20
Without any leadership from the top, Californians hear a cacophony of=20
proposals from below.
The Legislature, dominated by Democrats far out on the "left-wing yahoo"=20
scale, are talking about Texas power generators in the same overheated=20
rhetoric some right-wingers use to talk about the Chinese communists. One=
=20
talked about sending tanks to Houston.
Understandably, the utility companies are looking out for their own=20
interests.=20
Pacific Gas & Electric, angry that the governor refused to do anything abou=
t=20
the crisis, declared bankruptcy the day after Davis' say-nothing address to=
=20
Californians this month. As some commentators note, PG&E is far more=20
comfortable dealing with a bankruptcy judge than dealing with a governor an=
d=20
legislators who starred in "Clueless in Sacramento."
By contrast, Southern California Edison has chosen not to file bankruptcy=
=20
now, preferring instead to sell the state its transmission lines as a way t=
o=20
generate cash to keep this quasi-private entity going.=20
John Bryson, a longtime Davis associate and a creature of the=20
government/regulatory/utility model, frankly admits that the main rationale=
=20
for selling the lines to the state is to keep his company afloat, independe=
nt=20
and credit worthy.
But it's a lousy idea for taxpayers, who would gain a multibillion-dollar=
=20
liability badly in need of costly maintenance. I don't blame Bryson (who, b=
y=20
the way, co-founded the left-wing Natural Resources Defense Council early i=
n=20
his career) for looking out for his company first. But what's good for the=
=20
utilities is not necessarily good for taxpayers.
Then there are the self-proclaimed consumer advocates. Their goal seems to =
be=20
to destroy the utilities so bureaucrats can run the system. These are peopl=

who believe markets are the spawn of Satan.
Republicans have generally been content to let Davis twist in the wind, whi=

[B] Calif. Gov Davis/ PG&E utility creditors may like grid sale --Davis see=
s=20
Calif energy supply outstripping need by fall '03 --Davis/ PG&E credi <>








By Cristine Denver


San Francisco, April 30 (BridgeNews) - California Gov. Gray Davis said
Monday he has spoken with creditors of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the=20
utility that
filed for bankruptcy April 6, and they like the idea of potentially selling=
=20
the
company's transmission network to the state. Sempra Energy will also likely
agree to a similar deal, Davis said.



*                      *                   *



The California Department of Water Resources signed a memorandum of
understanding to buy Southern California Edison's grid for $2.76 billion. T=
he
deal is intended to help pay for past power costs, which drove Pacific Gas=
=20
&amp;
Electric, the state's biggest utility, to seek bankruptcy protection.


Sempra, whose utility, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, has been able to recov=
er
surging electricity costs,  "will also take something along (the) lines,"  =
of
Edison, Davis said.


Sempra CEO Stephen Baum has consistently told analysts that San Diego Gas=
=20
&amp;
Electric Co. and the state are in negotiations on the transmission purchase=
=20
and
that the price would be approximately 2.3 times the book value, which Baum=
=20
told
analysts last week was $433 million. The question has been the timing of a
Sempra deal. Sempra, and its regulated utility, are not under the same
financial pressure to sell its transmission system. SDG&amp;E was not force=
d=20
into a
major liquidity crisis as were PG&amp;E Co. and Southern California Edison.=
=20
SDG&amp;E
was able to pass on soaring purchase power costs to ratepayers, while the
state's other two investor-owned utilities were unable to raise rates.


On the sidelines with reporters at the J.P. Morgan Technology conference
here, Davis was asked what would make him think that Pacific Gas &amp;=20
Electric
Co.'s creditors might favor a deal similar to one worked out with Edison
International subsidiary Southern California Edison, and currently in
negotiations with Sempra Energy unit San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.


Davis responded saying that,  "The creditors committee called us and asked
for a briefing."  Davis said the creditors,  "like part of it (the Edison
plan), and asked some good questions."


In his presentation at the conference, Gov. Davis described the state's
strategy for solving the currently electric power supply crunch in four wor=
ds:
"Build more power plants."  Davis outlined the quick approvals that have be=
en
made to get power plants sited and construction started. He told the=20
conference
that by the fall of 2003, the state,  "will finally have more power than
California needs. We are on the glide path toward that goal; but can't make=
 up
for the inaction of the past 12 years overnight."


Davis was making a veiled reference to the 12 years during which Republican
governors occupied the office previous to Davis' election. It was during th=
e
administration of Republican Pete Wilson that California's deregulation pla=
n
was passed by the Legislature.


In addition to the power plant facility build up California will undergo,

Davis touted conservation efforts the state is making to reduce demand this

Davis Optimistic Despite Power Woes



SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which owes
billions of dollars and is seeking bankruptcy protection, still may
sell its transmission lines to the state, Gov. Gray Davis said
Monday.


Davis told reporters that a committee made up of businesses owed
money by PG&amp;E has asked for a briefing on the state's efforts to
buy the transmission lines of another financially troubled utility,
San Diego Gas and Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy.


``The creditors committee called us and asked for a briefing on
Sempra last week,'' Davis said at a technology conference hosted by
J.P. Morgan, adding he believes there is some possibility of buying
PG&amp;E's lines. ``It helps us because it helps get PG&amp;E back in.''


PG&amp;E did not immediately return calls for comment.


PG&amp;E, California's largest utility, filed for Chapter 11
protection April 6 after failed attempts by the state to buy its
transmission lines.


The governor struck a $3.5 billion deal with Southern California
Edison Co. for its lines, undeveloped land and the promise of
relatively cheap power. The deal requires legislative approval. The
state has offered $1 billion to Sempra Energy for a similar
package.


Since January, the state has committed more than $6 billion to
buying electricity for the customers of PG&amp;E, SoCal Edison and
SDG&amp;E.

Critics have faulted the administration for moving quickly to abandon a=20

Mr. Cheney said today that environmentalists had taken things too far. He=

Drastic measures to increase energy supplies are justified, he said, becaus=

Coal, Mr. Cheney said, has been neglected. It is the United States' ''most=

''The aim here is efficiency, not austerity,'' he said. ''Conservation may =

Some people who have talked with administration officials about the energy=

Fuel economy standards reached their peak in 1988, when the average passeng=

Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.=20
North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility=

that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year=
=20
than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last=

year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000=

each, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less tha=

$25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear=

The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District=20
acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were ''huge'' and=20
''obscene.'' But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, ''We would be=20
imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.''=20
Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns t=

dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It had=
 a=20
record $88.8 million in profits last year -- more than double its best=20
previous year.=20
Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customer=

is using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for=

local residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against=
=20
power shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility=
=20
estimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the=20
coming year.=20
Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to=

insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as no=

local needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant a=
nd=20
Chelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.=20
Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving=
 a=20
share of its profits to its customers.=20
''How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people=
=20
are paying more for electricity?'' asked Lon Topaz, director of resource=20
management for the utility. ''It would be lousy politics.''=20
An Upside-Down Economy=20
The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined=

with California's deregulation mess to further distort the energy market.=
=20
Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be=

and a long-distance bonanza.=20
As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower=

''We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were=

When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System=20

''All they do is scream and shout and they won't pay you the money they owe=

California in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said,=
=20
adding that it was California's ''awful mess'' in deregulating power market=
s=20
that fueled BC Hydro's record profits.=20
A Good Deal for Farmers=20
In the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the=
=20
Columbia from the world's premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable=
=20
lakes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a thi=
rd=20
of America's hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in t=
he=20
Northwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-voltage=
=20
transmission lines did not exist.=20
The main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in=
=20
the 1930's, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam i=
n=20
North America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily=20
designed as a water-delivery device for farmers.=20
Since then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to=20
shuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columb=
ia=20
Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in=
=20
federal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation,=
=20
which built it.=20
In addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia=
=20
and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out=
=20
of the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently=20
sells for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin=
=20
historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that ''no price is to=
o=20
high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.''=
=20
This year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the=20
Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricit=
y=20
from 29 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could=20
persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water=
=20
left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 millio=
n=20
(if it had to be purchased at current market prices).=20
In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville =
is=20
paying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for eac=
h=20
acre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County's public utility is=20
paying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land.=
=20
On April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe=
=20
here in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year,=
=20
they agreed that it was a good deal.=20
Still, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies=
=20
that keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the=20
precedent they set when they traded water for cash.=20
''This has to be a temporary deal,'' said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms=
=20
900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout.=
=20
''If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be n=

Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t=

''We have a wonderful energy fit,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro's=

themselves. ''We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high=20
demand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff =

BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell=20
power when it is most needed -- and most expensive -- in California. The=20
utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing=

water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power broug=

from across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucet=
s=20
and zaps electricity off to California.=20
''We spill water during the day,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Why? Is it because we=

can make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants=20
electricity, for God's sake.''=20
Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in th=

Western Dreaming -- a buyer's cartel 5/1/01




By Kathleen McFall
kmcfall@ftenergy.com
In California, the cost of electricity was $7 billion in 1999, $32 billion=
=20
last year, and if expectations hold true, will rise to $65 billion this yea=
r,=20
said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently. As a consequence of this=20
escalation, the pressure is mounting on state and federal legislators to=20
solve the California crisis=01*or to find someone else to blame it on. It's=
=20
increasingly looking like political suicide to do nothing.

Initiatives and insults are flying, and the only consensus in this=20
politically charged debate is that Western states are facing a grim summer,=
=20
and merchant power companies=01*an easy target=01*are somehow fleecing Cali=
fornia.

In this atmosphere, an interesting, albeit fringe, idea was recently posed =
in=20
a report by economist Peter Navarro of the University of California-Irvine=
=20
and Michael Shames of the San Diego-based consumer group the Utility=20
Consumers' Action Network (UCAN).

"California should join with Oregon and Washington to create a buyers' cart=
el=20
to offset the market power of the Western generators. This multistate buyer=
s'=20
cartel should offer to pay a reasonable price for power to the sellers'=20
cartel members=01*but not a penny more," said the report.

The report named Mirant, Enron, Dynegy, Reliant and Williams Cos. as member=
s=20
of a "sellers' cartel."

While the idea may be organizationally untenable, it nevertheless places th=
e=20
California situation in an interesting conceptual framework, given the=20
politicization of the crisis. It's certainly an approach many politicians=
=20
would rally around if they could figure out a way to use it to reduce OPEC'=
s=20
market influence.

The buyers' cartel
Shames, a consumer advocate, gained notoriety as the author of a 1999 paper=
=20
(posted on UCAN's Web site) that predicted today's energy crisis. He said t=
he=20
idea has garnered a positive response, in some circles.

"Surprisingly so," Shames said. "Supportive sentiments have been echoed by=
=20
the head of DWR [California Department of Water Resources] and a number of=
=20
economists including Paul Krugman in a New York Times op-ed piece." Accordi=
ng=20
to Shames, the recent Senate Bill SBX-73 introduced in California embodies=
=20
the critical elements of the cartel approach.

UCAN proposes the approach only as a backup plan in the event that the=20
Western situation turns catastrophic this summer. "One could view it as an=
=20
insurance policy; it would not need to be used unless the governor's summer=
=20
strategy begins to falter. It contains two elements: creation of a hard-nos=
ed=20
'buyers' cartel' and, if necessary, the forced sale of in-state generation=
=20
plants to the state," said the report.

Each day, a Western states buyers' cooperative would set a price it conside=
rs=20
fair and reasonable, based on the cost of producing electricity, natural ga=
s=20
prices or other fuels, and a generous double-digit profit margin in order t=
o=20
ensure future investment in the power infrastructure.

A power plant operator that wanted to sell electricity in these three Pacif=
ic=20
Coast states would meet the price set by the cooperative. Those who didn't=
=20
like the price could shut down their plants and sit out the market for the=
=20
day, said Shames and Navarro.

For this plan to be effective, the report's authors concede California's=20
legislature would have to pass emergency legislation to modify current law=
=20
requiring California's independent system operator to purchase power "at an=
y=20
price" to keep the lights on.

"This will empower the buyer's cartel to enforce its fair price offer," sai=
d=20
the report. It would also hold consumers hostage to a battle between cartel=
s.

Blackouts as leverage
"The formation of a buyers' cartel will almost certainly spark retaliatory=
=20
blackouts as the sellers' cartel tests the political will of our legislator=
s=20
and governor. Indeed, the bold measures proposed here will require politica=
l=20
fortitude," the report asserts.

To respond to this eventuality, instead of random rolling blackouts sweepin=
g=20
the state without notice, rotating outages would be planned and telegraphed=
=20
ahead of time. "That would give predictability to business and residents,=
=20
which is what most people want. It also would tip off the crooks, of course=
,=20
who might prey on homes suddenly left without alarms. But the cops,=20
forewarned as well, could mobilize ahead of them with extra patrols,"=20
suggests the report.

The authors believe calling the bluff once or twice would be enough to brin=
g=20
costs down to reasonable levels and break the "seller" cartel's market grip=
.

Merchant power companies would have to answer both to stockholders and the=
=20
outrage of public opinion if plants were intentionally idled during a=20
blackout. Blackouts appear to be inevitable this summer due to genuine powe=
r=20
shortages, but this approach would at least contain the price of available=
=20
power according to the logic of the report. The authors say that it's "a pl=
an=20
that a free-market economist could love. Buyers pooling their clout to win =
a=20
better price. People sacrificing to get what they want. Generators free to=
=20
participate, or not."

If the blackouts grew too disruptive, Shames and Navarro said, Gov. Gray=20
Davis and his counterparts in Oregon and Washington would have to use=20
emergency powers to seize the plants that refuse to play the game. That's=
=20
when things would get ugly.

Bunker mentality
The Shames and Navarro proposal has, at its core, a presumption of unfair=
=20
practices by merchant power, something these companies and other economists=
=20
would certainly refute. Ironically, this cartel approach could work in favo=
r=20
of merchant power as well as buyers, demonstrating that blackouts are not=
=20
linked to market manipulation.

Beyond theory, the idea would be difficult from a practical standpoint yet =
it=20
illustrates the growing frustration at many levels with the extraordinary=
=20
Western power market. As the report's authors conclude, by this summer, wit=
h=20
the air conditioning off and California's budget in tatters, "a buyers'=20
cartel could look downright reasonable."=20
