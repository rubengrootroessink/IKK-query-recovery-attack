Dear Mr Kean,

I am writing to you following a suggestion from Edith Terry (in Enron's DC
office) that I introduce myself to you with respect to prospective
employment with Enron. I will be permanently relocating to the United States
just prior to my marriage in Michigan this July and am looking to continue
my career in the energy sector. In particular, I have a strong interest in
the energy revolution taking place in the US, both on the commercial and
regulatory side and I would enjoy working for organisations, such as Enron,
that are leading this revolution. Edith suggested that you may be in a good
position to suggest opportunities within Enron for which I may be suitable.

I am currently based in Tokyo as the Australian energy representative to the
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC), where I have developed a strong
knowledge of the Asia Pacific energy market. In this position I have been
closely involved in the development of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply
Outlook, as well as ongoing research in the fields of energy efficiency,
natural gas development and energy pricing. Moreover, as part of my work
with APERC I have maintained a close contact with APEC Energy Working Group
activities, including the APEC Energy Business Network.

Prior to my appointment at APERC, I worked at the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in Canberra. During my term at
ABARE, I was closely involved in the development of the economic research
underlying Australia's position for the Kyoto climate change conference, and
also in the analysis of APEC (Asia Pacific) energy markets.

For you information, I have enclosed a brief resume which summarises my
background qualifications and experience.
Knowing that you have a busy schedule I would be most grateful for any
advice or assistance you are able to offer.

Yours sincerely,

Alastair L. Stevenson
Energy Economist (Australia)
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC)
