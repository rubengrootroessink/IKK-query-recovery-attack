This may have been announced while I was travelling, but I heard last Friday 
that Frank Blake has been offered, and accepted, the position of US DOE 
Deputy Secretary.  Frank was General Counsel of the EPA in the second Reagan 
Administration, then went to work for GE Power Systems in Schenectady NY. 
Most recently, he has been posted to Fairfield, Conecticut, I am told, where 
he was working on the GE/Honeywell merger.  mcs
