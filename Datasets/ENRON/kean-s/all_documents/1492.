Two suggestions:  I think the word "forgoing" should be "foregoing", and I
do not see the need for us to say what the Chinese Government decided, as
opposed to saying: "Subsequently, we understand the Chinese Government
decided . . . "   mcs

Rosie,

On September 25, 2000 the Tibetan Government-in-exile wrote Dr. Lay at the
Beijing office address requesting that Enron cancel its participation in
the Sebei-Lanzhou pipeline.   We faxed a copy of this communication to you
a few minutes ago.  We have drafted the attached proposed response.
Rebecca McDonald concurs with the approach in this letter, which has been
reviewed by the addressees of this message.  Your assistance in
appropriately formatting and printing the letter for signature would be
appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need
assistance.

Thanks,

John
