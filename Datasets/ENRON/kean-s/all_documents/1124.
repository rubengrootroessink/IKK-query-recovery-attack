> Dear Mr. Kean,
>
> Following a telephone conversation with Jeffrey Skilling's office earlier,
> I have pleasure in forwarding you a copy of the updated programme and a

> to be vital for anyone affiliated with Italian Energy and will be covering
> key topics in response to the recent deregulation of the electricity and
> natural gas markets in Italy. The main issues to be discussed include:
>
> * From state monopoly to open market: the state role in the new market
> * Opportunities for international companies in the deregulated gas
> markets
> * European Union directives and cross-border regulations
> * The changing gas market: supply and demand
> * Convergence of gas and power
>
> (Please see the attached programme and priority booking form for more
> information).
>
> If for some reason you are unable to attend, I'd be extremely grateful if
> you could forward this on to anyone at Enron who you feel may find this of
> interest. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future and
> sincerely hope that your company will be participating in some shape or
> form.
