Imad Tareen forwarded me his resume for a possible job opportunity in our
group.  (Please see below.)  I have never met him before, and I have no
idea how he got my phone number, but his resume looks quite good.  What do
you think?

Hi  Yvette

Thanks for your help.  I  am very interested in exploring opportunities in
your group.  I have a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard which deals a
lot with communications and running  campaigns.
