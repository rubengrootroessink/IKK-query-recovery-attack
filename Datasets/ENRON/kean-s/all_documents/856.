Mitch, Don't kill me, just call.


Attached are  revised slides, revised as follows:

1. Cover page adds "OPUC" and changes the date to today's date
2. The first bullet under the FERC timeline -- added statement that FERC 
order is more likely to be issued towards the end of the year
3. Under Additional Information Required -- included statement that the 
delivered price test on the Alturas Line should include various buyback 
options for Sierra from its divested generators
4. Under Issues to be Resolved -- consolidated three bullets into two 
discussing the potential impact California plays  on FERC's action on the 
merger
5. Deleted the bullet under the SEC slide stating that the SEC could begin 
considering the application before FERC  issues its final order -- we could 
not verify this with Joanne, and Sam Behrends said he thinks the SEC is 
unlikely to act on the application (due to workload) before FERC issues its 
order.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
