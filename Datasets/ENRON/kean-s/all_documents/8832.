Steve --
 
A question aimed far below your pay grade.  Our most recent invoice to Enron 
(dating from April) has not yet been paid.  Our accountant, Paul Hart, 
reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to direct the 
invoices says he is no longer the appropriate person to approve it.
 
Any guidance on to whom we should turn?
 
All the best,
 
Nelson

Nelson:
 
We spoke to Enron's accounting dept who said that the invoice is still in 
their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices have been 
sent) said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The accountant 
asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your 
thoughts.
 
Paul
