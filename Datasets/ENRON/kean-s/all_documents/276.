Joe and Sarah:  here's the draft bill which Senator Slade Gorton plans to 
introduce on reliability (same as Administration's plus the Northwest 
adjustments)....I am making the argument to the Senator that this is not 
enough, that native load issues also cause reliability problems and am asking 
him to add to his bill.....but, he is in a tough re-election battle (probably 
one of the toughest in the country) so he is acting with extreme caution.
