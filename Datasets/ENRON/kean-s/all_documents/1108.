Mike:   here is a message from Steve Kean that is very relevant to the part=
=20
of our call the other day in which we discussed the need to determine what=
=20
EHS' (or Environmental Strategies') role should be in communicating with JI=
m=20
Steffes' group and documenting the value we add.   I will talk to Jim, but =
I=20
am planning to have my group provide this information and meet the deadline=
=20
in this memo.   You may want to inquire with Steve as to whether others in=
=20
EHS should participate as well.

Dear Colleagues,
=20
On numerous occasions this past year, Enron Government Affairs (EGA) suppor=
t=20
provided to commercial groups resulted in substantial increases in project=
=20
economics and enhanced the overall value of many deals. The Regulatory Risk=
=20
Analytics group has been tasked to help you quantify EGA=01,s portion of th=
is=20
value added over the past year. For budgetary reasons, it is critical for=
=20
every EGA member to participate in this exercise and document his/her share=
=20
of significant value added.  Please contact Gia Maisashvili or John Neslage=
=20
to discuss the  methodology for determining EGA=01,s value added as soon as=
=20
possible.   The contact information for Gia is (713)  853-4346, and for Joh=
n=20
its (713) 853-6827.

The dead line for this effort is Friday,  September 1st

Thank you for your cooperation
