In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other=20
companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed=
=20
within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by=20
consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a hu=
ge=20
untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an=20
internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and ha=
ve=20
decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the=
=20
time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning=20
dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR communit=
y=20
will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order=
=20
to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles=
=20
will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

? I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas=
=20
of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reportin=
g=20

overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as=

Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barr=

The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Busines=

Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the=
=20
generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report=20
directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report=
=20
jointly to their business unit OTC=01,s and to David from a functional HR=
=20
perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

? Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation=
=20
services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation=20
responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne=
