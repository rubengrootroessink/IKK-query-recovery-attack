Content Strategy/User Experience Meeting Notes

Attendees:
Allen Elliott - mynetwork.com
Marie Hejka =01) KM Task Force Chair
Brandon Rigney =01) my.home.enron.com

Meeting Details.
Per Allen Elliott, myportal.com is a proof of concept portal, a production=
=20
ready prototype portal developed using Tibco Portalbuilder =01) Enron=01,s =
standard=20
portal development tool. =20

What content is accessible from the portal needs to be decided.  Each=20
Business Unit (and Functional Unit within) needs to decide the following: w=
ho=20
makes this call, what is important for the BU/FU to have on a portal, who h=
as=20
responsibility for the content, who will publish it, and who will maintain=
=20
it?  Historically, this is a challenge to determine.  Business Units and=20
Functional Units typically want desired information available, but do not=
=20
want to take any responsibility in defining, creating, or managing the=20
information. =20

Per Brandon Rigney, the four tabs identified by the ASE breakout group are=
=20
organization centric.  This is a problem for users.  For example, if the=20
aisles in a library were arranged by publishers (i.e. Simon & Schuster,=20
Prentice Hall, McGraw Hill, etc.) one would have to know the publisher of t=
he=20
information before a subject could be located.  This would not provide easy=
=20
access to information. =20

Does the above analogy rule out the task force=01,s interest in unveiling a=
=20
portal with defined areas  from which all users blast (Rick Causey=01,s wor=
d)? =20
The Content Strategist/User Experience experts are not telling the task for=
ce=20
members what to do as much as they are informing us what to expect from wha=
t=20
we have been discussing to do.  If easy access to information is our=20
objective, perhaps we may further discuss the implication of designated bla=
st=20
points. =20

Brandon and Allen recommended using the BU/FU to determine what is accessed=
=20
from the portal for a given business unit. =20

Meeting Conclusion.
Requirements Phase=09Design Phase=09Build Phase=09Test Phase =09Launch Phas=
e
Even though Bryan Powell=01,s organization is scheduled to release the proo=
f of=20
concept portal the week of 12/11, we are still in the requirements phase of=
=20
the project.  Again, the portal is a proof of concept for Tibco=20
Portalbuilder.  The first version of the portal will reflect information=20
pulled in from multiple areas of Enron.  Additional versions of the portal=
=20
will be released reflecting a BU/FU specific content. =20

Marie will work with task force members to use BU/FU contacts to define BU/=
FU=20
portal content requirements. =20

Content, content, content.  Task force members need to determine through BU=
s=20
what to include.

Recommendations from the ASE need to be reviewed.

Next Steps.
Assign task force members to interview BU/FU contacts
Invite task force members to participate in Content Strategy/User Experienc=
e=20
meetings
Task force and Content Strategy/User experience team further discuss ASE=20
recommendations
Emphasize myportal.com, it is a proof of concept for Tibco and Interwoven
