Neither Ken nor Jeff are available.  It would probably be better for one of 
you to speak anyway.  Any interest?

Dear Pankaj, 

I enjoyed meeting you last week in BA.? Steve Reifenberg and I are both 
grateful for your willingness to speak to Ken Lay at Enron on our behalf.?? I 
have attached a copy of the letter we sent to him, as well as the preliminary 
program for the October 20 DRCLAS Corporate Partners Program.? When we called 
to follow up, we were told that it was unlikely that Ken Lay would be able to 
participate, so we extended the invitation to Jeff Skilling as well.? We 
would be delighted to have either one speak on the case of Enron at the 
event. 

Thanks again, and please let me know if there is someone in Lay's office with 
whom I should follow up after you speak with him. 

Best, 
Ellen
