I am interested, but it's probably more important that Jeff Dasovich and 
Sandi Mccubbin (in our SF office) know, so that they can keep the politicos 
informed (and keep them from doing something stupid).

Thanks

Steve - I just saw your video and it is great - I think it will be released 
Wednesday on our web site and will be available to a very large group - Your 
comments will put the issues in SD in perspective.  We have a team of six now 
calling the market in SD.  If you'd like us to review our market plan in SD 
with you let me know.  

Thanks again for your time.
