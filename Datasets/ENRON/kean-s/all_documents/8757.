Great news.  With respect to the Commissoners, I think it makes sense to go 
back through Ellen and ask if she could set up meetings with a few 
commissioners ater the staff briefing.

Subject: FERC course on for Thurs, July 26, 1-4 p.m.

Susan got it done -- it'll be Thursday, July 26, 1-4 p.m. at FERC (a room on
the 3rd floor?).  Susan has talked with Bill Albrecht.  He'll probably be
coming in on Wed. p.m. Steve, any ideas about a Commissioner strategy?
(invite them to attend, if the FERC folks agree; ask the FERC folks to do
the inviting; ask the FERC folks to help set up meetings afterwards or a
follow on if they like what we do and think it useful for Commissioners; try
to do a walkaround -- that is, offer to have Jerry, Bill, Susan visit
commissioners individually Friday a.m. after the course or Thursday a.m.
before the course?) Wendy
