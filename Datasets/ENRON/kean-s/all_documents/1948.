Steve,

Thank you for taking the time to see me whenever I have requested an 
appointment with you. I believe there are discussions to consolidate Enron 
websites and also to develop a Knowledge Management infrastructure.  You and 
I have shared some thoughts on these subjects. Properly managed, these are 
potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative. I 
know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I 
can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time.

It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas. Among 
the several benefits, a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both 
development and maintenance costs.  Also, we would eliminate duplications and 
give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize 
corporate branding.  

I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy. 
Nevertheless, I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would 
like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort. 
Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this 
position. My relationship with business units has given me a unique 
education.  I have developed information value chain, built and managed three 
websites in three different operating companies. At all times my products 
were considered benchmarks. In addition, I shall be able to manage potential 
political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation. 

I should be grateful if you would think about this. 

Once again, thank you for your time.
