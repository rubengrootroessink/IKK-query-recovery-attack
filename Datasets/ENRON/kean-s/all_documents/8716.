Re the attached email , he is highly recommended by Reliant's lawyer in 
Saramento. Jacobs served in Drivon's role in the Senate proceedings involving 
Ins Comm'r Quackenbush last year and is well known and respected in the 
Legislature. He has been informally advising Reliant's lawyer on contempt 
issues. He does not think he has a conflict and will confirm that. Initially 
his role would be solely as a consultant.
