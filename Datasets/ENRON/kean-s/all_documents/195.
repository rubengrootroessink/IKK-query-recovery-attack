Ambassador Hugo Paemen, Former Head of the European Commission's Washington
Delegation, Joins Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.
Washington, D.C., December 8, 1999 - Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., a Washington,
D.C.-based law firm with more than 650 attorneys and 16 offices throughout
the United States and Europe, is pleased to announce that Hugo Paemen, until
recently Head of the European Commission's Washington Delegation, has joined
the firm as Senior Advisor. Ambassador Paemen will split his time between
the firm's Washington and Brussels offices. He will advise U.S., European,

and will provide counsel on a wide variety of trade and investment matters
involving the European Union and the United States. In addition to his
position at Hogan & Hartson, Ambassador Paemen will serve as Senior Advisor
to the German Marshall Fund.

Ambassador Paemen was nominated to the position of Head of the European
Commission's Washington Delegation in July 1995. Between 1987 and that date,
Ambassador Paemen served as Deputy Director-General of the European
Commission's Trade Directorate, where among his many accomplishments he
served as the European Community's Chief Negotiator during the entire length
of the Uruguay Round. From 1985 to 1987 he served as the official spokesman
of the first Delors Commission, and from 1978 to 1985 he served as Chef de
Cabinet of Commissioner Viscount Davignon. Prior to 1978, Ambassador Paemen
held various positions in the Belgian Embassies in Geneva, Paris and
Washington, including service as Economic Minister in the Washington Embassy
from 1974 to 1978. He is presently Special Adviser to European Commission
President Romano Prodi and a Member of the Board of the Catholic University
of Leuven.

"We are extremely pleased that Ambassador Paemen is joining the firm," said
Bob Glen Odle, Hogan & Hartson Managing Partner. "His many years of
experience at the European Commission and his broad-based knowledge of
international trade issues will benefit immensely our clients on both sides
of the Atlantic."

In Washington, D.C., Ambassador Paemen will work with the firm's commercial
and regulatory practice groups to assist clients engaged in investment and
international trade matters. In Brussels, where the firm's practice includes
areas such as competition, communications, food, biotechnology, trade,
arbitration, and international transactions, he will work with resident
attorneys to provide clients with strategic counseling on a wide range of EU
issues. Ambassador Paemen will also assist attorneys in the firm's six other
European offices with matters involving EU law and policy.

"Ambassador Paemen has given the European Union outstanding representation
here in the United States," said Clayton Yeutter, Of Counsel to Hogan &
Hartson and a former United States Trade Representative. "He is a brilliant
diplomat and one of the world's most gifted and respected trade negotiators.
His international trade knowledge is encyclopedic."

"I view this next phase in my career as continuing my life-long commitment
to fostering better international trade and investment relations, in
particular between Washington and Brussels," said Ambassador Paemen. "I have
long been impressed by Hogan & Hartson's experience in these areas and the
sophisticated advice they offer their clients. I look forward to joining the
Hogan & Hartson team."
