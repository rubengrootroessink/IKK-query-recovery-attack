Brad,

I just talked with Brad Nebergall, and he mentioned that he called Farrell 
Gerbode, our counterpart at Rice, who confirmed that it was a 
misunderstanding.  He will talk with Farrell's boss as well, to make sure 
that the situation is clarified with the Rice President.  In the meantime 
we're working to put together a deal for Rice to make a circuit available 
sooner.

have a good weekend,
