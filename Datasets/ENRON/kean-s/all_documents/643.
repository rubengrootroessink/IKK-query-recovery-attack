ASIA & AFRICA
From: John Ambler@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 06/07/2000 02:54 PM

We do not currently subscribe to such trade publications for Asia and 
Africa.  We do deal with and monitor a number of publications, but many are 
not in English.  Two useful online publications are www.nni.nikkei.co.jp and 
www.energyasia.com.

As for major magazines, Nikkei Business is the premier business magazine in 
Japan.  In most areas there are major newspapers that are more influential.

JAPAN
From: Michael Grimes@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 05/08/2000 08:38 AM
I'm trying to get a subscription to the Nikkei, which has an electronic site 
at:

http://www.nni.nikkei.co.jp/

I also have a free subscription to the PMA news site, which has proved 
useful. http://www.powermarketers.com/main.htm

I would call the Nikkei the closest to Forbes in Japan.
