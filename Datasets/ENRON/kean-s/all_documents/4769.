Steve, it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday.  For the 
speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron 
strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of 
energy development.  Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the 
commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.  But the 
Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters 
in the traditional sense.  We will continue to have the status of a colony if 
we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are 
evolving.  If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then 
we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role 
in this evolution.  I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a 
short Qand A period.  But your message can be as succint as you can make it 
and get the point across.  You may have to present the Enron case a number of 
different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   
You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address 
role playing by the state and the commission.  Plan to join us for lunch.  If 
you need more detail, let me know.  Thanks!  Stephen
