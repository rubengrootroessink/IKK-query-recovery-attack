Steve  Here  are  4  slides I developed for your  use,  two showing the 
cumulative  gas cost
savings  in the  U.S.   at the city gate due  to  deregulation of the 
interstate pipelines -- calculated   in both nominal and real terms   since 
1984.  The  savings
have  grown  to over  $144  billion  (nominal)  and   $268 billion  ( in real 
terms ).

The other   two  slides show  what  key  factors  moved    WTI   market 
prices   and  Louisiana   gas prices over the past  12 months.  I am 
developing the final 
electricity  price  slide to show the key  factors   that  changed   US  
electricity prices at key basis  points--  including  Southern California   
and  ERCOT  over the past   12 months...  Margaret
