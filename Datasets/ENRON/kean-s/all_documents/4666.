Steve,

Is it too late to include XMS and ibuyit roll out dates, see comments below.


George,

Any idea what John is referring to as Web site for professional services

George\Suzanne,

Any answer to insurance question and whether we can support events from 
Houston.

Thanks

Kevin

John,

Thanks for your comments.  Unfortunately because of my trip over there, which 
of course you know about, I am receiving this Thurs PM and possibly too 
late to incorporate in the email.  But to address your points;

1) We do not intend to exclude Legal, although we have to finesse Derrick who 
is very protective of his relationships.  Are you referring to the ibuyit 
webite which you refer to, it wasn't clear from your comments

2) You make a good point on the roll out dates as we say that we want all 
employees to use it by July 1 but it may not be active everywhere,
particularly London, by that date.

3) We do not explictedly refer to ibuyit for use in travel in the new memo, 
although roll out dates would help in the same manner as for XMS.

4) TAP is the preferred agency in the US, and I believe also Europe, and we 
mention them by name in the revised memo.  I don't like to be 
constrained to TAP (like Vitol) but it is incredibly easier to manage 
expenses and get standard reporting by using them.  Let me know if TAP
isn't available in Europe.

5) I will have Suzanne Brown check on the insurance issue and get back to you.

6) If Global Travel can't handle your trips due to logistical constraints, I 
would really encourage you and Micheal to institue some 
formal sign off procedure, at your levels, for events exceeding something 
like $5k.

7) Changes made.

Thanks for the comments, hope all is well

Kevin

Here is my suggested response to Kevin on the attached document - may I 
please have your thoughts before I send:
1)  For professional services I think you intend to exclude legal - but I 
would be explicit on this.  Our biggest professional service
is probably AA and that is negotiated with Causey at the lead.  I don't see 
anything on the web page referred here about professional
services.
2)  The on-line expense reporting tool has not yet been rolled out to the 
entire company - so we need to include the roll-out dates
outside of Houston.
3.  The best practices for travel may be included in clicktrip.com but it is 
not obvious to me how one gets a password and absent
that you can't log on.
4.  For travel we have different preferred travel agencies outside of 
Houston.  We should list them. Also many employees have at times
stopped using these services because they found chepaer routes on their own.  
So we will have to handle the delicate matter of reminding
them not to stop thinking and to report to the company and travel agency when 
they are coming up with less expensive alternatives.
5.  Regarding Car rental services are we sure that our contracts cover Enron 
with insurance outside the US?  Again if they come up
with an alternative that is less expensive that the travel agency we want 
them to choose the less expensive route not to mention speaking
up about it.
6.  I will check on it but I doubt if it is practical for the Global Travel 
Management group to arrange off-site groups outside of London.
7.  Last paragraph change "many of who" to "many of whom".


John
