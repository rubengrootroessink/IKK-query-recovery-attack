Good to hear that you're still alive and kicking after your recent world
travels.

You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question
will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November.
Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign
he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the
rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well. We'll
see if they learned any lessons.

My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month
and I'm helping to raise money for the event. I can't escape.

Excellent choice for vacation. You all will love it. Not only is it great
for us adults, I think your girls will really enjoy it as well. The one
thing I would recommend (before I bring in my file and bore you with too
much) is to try and stay in one or maybe two places and not move to
different hotels. It's easy to do day trips via car or train and it's great
to come back to the same place. Granted, we were there for two weeks and
were staying at a beautiful hillside, 5 bedroom villa with a pool, but it
gives you more flexibility in your schedule, i.e. if you want to take it
easy one day and just walk around the town you're in and have a leisurely
lunch. Off the top of my head (and I will bring in my file) my favorite
places were some of the obvious such as Florence which is good for at least
one if not two full days and Siena, where Sue Mara and her family were there
for the famous horse races in the city square, but also some of the smaller
towns were just as interesting. San Gimignano is famous for its towers that
rise out of the landscape, sort of like the Houston skyline, and do a day
bike ride through the Chianti region and hit at least one winery. We did one
around Montepulciano where we stopped for lunch. There are bike tour groups
that will arrange all of it for you. I would also make the effort to go to
the Tuscan coast and specifically Portifino, one of the most beautiful ports
I've ever seen. And then if you're kids aren't susceptible to car sickness,
I would do the drive along the Chicutira (sp?) coast which is a series of
little fishing villages. This is probably more than you ever wanted to know,
but the more familiar you are with the area before you go over there, the
smoother it will be so I also recommend buying a Fodders, or whatever it's
called. They're well worth it. Also be forewarned that if you rent a car,
they are very small. Fortunately, the Kean family is also small.

Job is going great and settling into big city life very smoothly. Our stock
has been taking a beating thanks in part to your guy, Clinton, and his
interventionists statements that erased $50 billion from the biotech sector
in one day last week. But we'll make up for it when we roll out our cure.

Call if you're up this way. Greetings to everyone on the floor.

How's it going.  Have you cured cancer yet?
In other news, the Bob Jones/confederate flag strategy appears to have paid
off
for your buddy.

I'm taking the wife and kids to Tuscany this summer.  Any advice from your
trip
there?
Stay in touch.
