I am sending you the resume of Jennifer Salisbury who is Energy Sec. here in 
NM and I think she is great!  She is looking to move back into the private 
sector, and if we have an opening or can help her with one, that would be 
wonderful.  Thanks.

 <<jenbio revised_.doc>>  Leslie -- Thanks a million for getting back to me
so quickly.  Yes, I'd be willing to relocate.  I'm more interested in how
challenging the work would/could be (and the level of pay) then where I am
physically located.  Attached is my resume.  Feel free to send it to the
headhunter who called you and/or to anyone you think might be interested at
Enron.  Jennifer

PS  I had never talked to Schaefer before the Boise meeting.  He was not
very impressive and I agree with your assessment that you will not be able
to persuade him on the price cap issue.
