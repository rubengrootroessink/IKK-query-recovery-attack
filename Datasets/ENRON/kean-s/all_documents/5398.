MEMORANDUM

To:    IEP
Fr:     Ray McNally, Richard Temple, Tony Russo, Jean Munoz, Tom Ross
Re:   Initiative Campaign Strategy Outline


Harvey Rosenfield has on numerous occasions threatened to place an initiative 
on the 2002 ballot to re-regulate the power industry.

It is not a hollow threat.

Not only has Rosenfield successfully placed initiatives on the ballot in the 
past, but the current energy crisis has become the number one issue on the 
minds of voters dd making it easier to qualify a ballot measure.  And our own 
internal polling for IEP shows voters would initially support the concept of 
re-regulating the industry.

However, qualifying an initiative for next year?s election is not a foregone 
conclusion.  And passing one is an even more difficult task.

Rosenfield faces several roadblocks:

o    The current energy issue is complicated, and all potential solutions 
have weaknesses that could be exploited in a political campaign.

o    IEP?s internal polling shows Rosenfield?s proposal has weaknesses that 
could be exploited dd including the price tag and the image of a state-run 
energy department that could be compared to the DMV and CalTrans.

o    Rosenfield would have a difficult time funding a campaign, especially 
raising the resources to overcome a strong, well funded "no" campaign.

o    The burden of "proof" always falls on the "yes" campaign rather than the 
"no" campaign.  Voters are concerned about giving their approval to changes 
that could make things worse.  Rosenfield will have to prove his case beyond 
a shadow of a doubt, and therefore it is easier to defeat an initiative than 
it is to pass one. 

o    If power generators become motivated they can be a formidable opponent.

Following is (1) a preliminary timeline Rosenfield would face in trying to 
qualify an initiative for the ballot in 2002, (2) strategic concepts that 
should be considered before pursuing a plan to defeat the initiative, (3) 
preliminary strategic and tactical options in opposing the initiative, and 
(4) a discussion of campaign costs.

We recommend using this outline as a starting point to develop an effective 
campaign plan that could successfully defeat Rosenfield if he pursues an 
initiative strategy.


Timeline

To date, no proposed ballot initiative has been submitted to the Attorney 
General for title and summary.  Accordingly, there is not sufficient time 
available to qualify an initiative for the March 2002 ballot.  

However, there is still adequate time to qualify a measure for the November 
2002 ballot.  We believe Rosenfield could submit a measure to the Attorney 
General as late as September, 2001 and still qualify the initiative for the 
November 2002 ballot dd especially if the summer months produce power 
blackouts, skyrocketing energy bills, and the image of a bungling Governor, 
legislature and regulators.

The following timeline would allow Rosenfield to submit language for title 
and summary as late as September 28, 2001 and qualify the initiative for the 
November 2002 ballot:

September 28, 2001

Proposed measure is submitted to the AG for title and summary.

November 20, 2001

Attorney General prepares and issues title and summary.  Proponent can begin 
circulating petitions.

April 19, 2002

The proponent files the petitions with county elections officials.

May 1, 2002

County elections officials complete petition raw count totals and certify raw 
numbers to the Secretary of State.

June 23, 2002

County elections officials verify and certify results of the number of valid 
signatures in their counties and turn in counts to the Secretary of State.

June 27, 2002

Secretary of State determines if the initiative qualifies for the ballot. 
Proponent needs 670,816 valid signatures to qualify a constitutional 
amendment or 419,260 valid signatures to qualify a straight statute.


Strategic Concepts

There are several strategic concepts that should be reviewed:

o    While satisfying Rosenfield may be impossible, IEP could push hard to 
ensure a "solution" is passed by the legislature to give credibility to the 
criticism that Rosenfield is an extremist whose initiative could undercut the 
legislative remedy.

o    The industry could organize a well-funded campaign that contains an 
early advertising blitz to quickly define the ballot measure in the most 
negative manner possible, and that delivers a knock out punch in October.

o    Generators could promote a counter-initiative proposal, either through 
the legislature or qualified by petition dd stopping Rosenfield?s proposal if 
more "yes" votes are received for the counter initiative than the Rosenfield 
measure.

o    Paid signature gathering firms could be put on contract for 
industry-related business dd thus keeping these firms off the table for 
Rosenfield.  Another variation would be to hire firms to gather signatures 
calling for legislative action dd thus gaining names of voters who support 
our position, but also keeping signature gatherers too busy to help 
Rosenfileld. 

o    The industry could pay to gather signatures on petitions that removes 
names of people who may have signed the petition for Rosenfield?s 
initiative.  This could cut down the number of valid signatures accepted by 
county election officials.

o    A paid advertising campaign could be run during the proposal?s signature 
gathering phase urging voters not to sign the petitions.  An added benefit of 
the concept is defining the proposal early if it still qualifies for the 
ballot. 

o    We could organize a legal assault on the proposal dd stopping their 
signature gathering efforts or keeping it off the ballot.


Campaign Strategy

If the proposal qualifies for the ballot, the industry must pursue an 
aggressive strategy to defeat the measure.  We need to identify weaknesses in 
the proposal and share those weaknesses with voters.  We must also push 
voters to question the motives behind the initiative.  We need to make sure 
voters are uncomfortable with all or portions of the initiative to ensure 
they vote no despite wanting adequate and affordable energy.

The campaign should conduct thorough research to determine the best strategy 
to defeat the measure.  Initially we believe the "no" campaign should focus 
on testing and developing the following messages:

o    The measure will hurt taxpayers.  A $40 billion price tag is too much 
for voters to accept as the only solution to the problem.

o    The proposal will hurt public services.  The cost of Rosenfield?s 
measure will keep money away from more important programs  dd like schools, 
public safety and programs for children and seniors.

o    The ballot measure is simply a way for elected officials to get more tax 
dollars to cover up their failures dd and they should not be rewarded with 
public support.

o    Rosenfield?s proposal will result in higher taxes to pay for more 
bureaucracy and wasted tax dollars.

o    The proposal will result in more inefficient government that will 
produce unreliable power dd hurting consumers, and vital services such as 
hospitals and public safety.

o    The measure will hurt the economy and cost jobs at a time when the 
economy is hurting.

Campaign Tactics 

The campaign should follow an aggressive battleplan that includes the 
following components:

Research

Focus groups and quantitative surveys should be conducted to help craft the 
best messages to attack the proposal.  This research would also be important 
in efforts to secure the most favorable ballot title and summary possible to 
our goal of defeating it.

Demographic and election research should also be conducted to determine 
voters most open to our campaign messages.  We should also conduct thorough 
research on Rosenfield to expose his true motivations for proposing this 
measure and its inherent weaknesses.

Legal, Title & Summary, and Ballot Argument Challenges

We should pursue every possible legal option to either get the proposal off 
the ballot, or ensure the most favorable title & summary and weakened ballot 
arguments for the initiative sponsors.  Our experience shows that the ballot 
title and summary can swing initial vote margins either way by as much as 10 
points.

Paid Advertising

Statewide campaigns in California require paid advertising dd including 
electronic media, direct mail, and telemarketing.  Advertising should be 
carefully targeted to ensure the most "bang for the buck."

Earned Media

Editorial support is an important part of successful statewide campaigns, as 
is ensuring favorable media coverage of the campaign.  A focused earned media 
campaign would greatly enhance the chances for success and editorial support 
and Op-Ed?s can provide important third party credibility to the no campaign.

Coalition Building

It will be critical for the industry to gain credible allies in its fight 
against Rosenfield.  We do not want the campaign to be portrayed as 
generators versus consumer groups.  Therefore, we need credible, third party 
groups standing along side us to broaden our appeal and message, like 
taxpayer groups, business leaders, consumer organizations, energy experts, 
economists, educators, law enforcement and seniors.


Campaign Costs

How much will be needed to defeat Rosenfield will depend on several factors.  
Depending on several variables, the cost of a "no" campaign can range from a 
few million dollars to as much as the $40 million spent to defeat Proposition 
9.  

Campaign costs to defeat ballot measures are contingent upon several 
variables:

o    The popularity of the measure with voters.  The more they like it on the 
natural, the more expensive it will be to defeat the measure.

o    How much money Rosenfield can raise to promote the measure.  If he has 
few resources, the "no" campaign will have an uncontested paid advertising 
campaign, which will make defeating the proposal much easier.

o    How bad the energy crisis impacts voters.  If the next 15 months produce 
an on-going crisis, campaign costs will rise.

o    The effectiveness of messages against the proposal.  If focus group and 
survey research confirm the proposal has an Achilles heel, the cost to defeat 
the measure will go down dramatically.

Thorough research of Rosenfield?s actual proposal will better enable us to 
recommend a campaign plan, message and budget.  In summary, defeating the 
Rosenfield initiative will cost from a few to several million dollars and a 
united industry effort.
