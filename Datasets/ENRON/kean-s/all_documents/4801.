I think we need to keep the pressure on.  I liked the way our basic message=

was evolving over the course of last week.  As you pointed out, the Japanes=

utilities view us as just another annoying US company who is going to come=

in, bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave.  We nee=

to continue to reinforce the message that not only are we not going away, w=

are starting other businesses here to keep us going while we continue to=20
agitate for reform in the electricity sector.

To date, reports on Enron's role in California have been limited to a repri=
nt=20
of a Sacramento Bee article appearing in the Denki Shimbun - a limited=20
circulation publication sponsored by the Japanese utilities. Last Friday Mr=
=20
Ohta, President of Chubu Electric and Chairman of the Federation of Electri=
c=20
Power Companies, made some uninformed comments at a regular energy press cl=
ub=20
briefing about Enron's commitment to its Californian customers . Ohta will =
be=20
retiring from both positions in two weeks.=20

In the past both Chubu Electric and the Federation of Electric Power=20
Companies have distanced themselves from Mr Ohta's public comments which ar=
e=20
generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts. As =
a=20
result, we have tended to ignore his comments. However, on this occasion I=
=20
think we need to set the record straight on Enron's role in California. I=
=20
would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or=
=20
respond.

Over the past few months we have received various statements from Houston=
=20
(for both internal and external consumption) explaining Enron's role in=20
California. Most recently (May 10) we received from Peggy Mahoney (via Vanc=
e)=20
an EES statement dated 1 February entitled "Media Statement about EES=20
Resourcing California Customers". It would be helpful if there is a=20
comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could=
=20
distribute here. If not, we can put something together here tomorrow and=20
email it across to you for approval, with the aim of getting something out=
=20
Wednesday.

As an aside, we had a record 3,766 visitors to the EJ website last Friday,=
=20
the day the Brattle paper appeared on the website.

kind regards       =20
