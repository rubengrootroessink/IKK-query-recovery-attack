Shelley:
I'm talking to those folks this afternoon---I'll be spending a lot of time 
pushing the themes of the settlement we worked on for so darned long as the 
solution to California's gas woes.  Will also help them understand the 
woes---and there are many---which we discussed many times.  If you'd like to 
participate in my call this afternoon, and/or if it would be useful for me to 
sit in on your discussion, just let me know.  In any case, I'll report back 
on what happens on my call this afternoon.

Best,
Jeff

McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see 
that they are very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling 
in proposed answers.
