Subject: Your June 21 Trip

We have confirmed a meeting for you with Senator Feinstein.  In addition, we 
are presently trying to schedule you with Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, 
Hagel, Domenici, Johnson, and Cantwell.   You will be here at a very 
important time.  

In addition, Ken Lay is slated to be in New York on June 15.  We are trying 
to get appointments for him with Senator Schumer and Rep. Rangel.  If we are 
unsuccessful in lining up anything for him in NY, we have "penciled in" Ken 
on Chairman Bingaman's calendar for 10:30 am that day, here in DC.  Ken is in 
NY Thursday night for an award, and I understand is planning to be in NY 
Friday night, but his calendar at present is clear during the day.  If we 
don't get the Schumer appointment in NY, I will being asking you to see if 
Ken is willing to make a quick trip during the day on Friday to DC to see 
Bingaman and, if we can get him, Leader Daschle.  I think it would be worth a 
quick trip from NY and will still allow him to be in NY that night.
