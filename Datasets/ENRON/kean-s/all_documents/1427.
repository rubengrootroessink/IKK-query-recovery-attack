John/Steve,

Attached is a draft letter to Party Secretary Zhou Yong Kang of Sichuan 
Province declining an invitation for Ken Lay to speak at the 2000  Western 
Forum of China.  Secretary Zhou was recently in Houston and has extended an 
invitation to Ken Lay to speak at this conference.

Please make any changes you feel are necessary, have Ken Lay's office print 
for his signature and send to Kari Duncan for faxing and forwarding.  If you 
have any questions, let us know.

Thanks.  --Keith
