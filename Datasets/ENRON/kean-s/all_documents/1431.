Isn't our primary problem with AEP's internal merchant function rather than 
with the marketing affiliate (I realize we have problems with the affiliate 
too)?  Can we protest continued market based rate authority for AEP until 
they have surrendered native load priority?

		 Subject: EPMI protests AEP's continuation of MBRs

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request 
to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes 
examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. 

EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier 
this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR 
filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.
