A  question aimed far below your pay grade.? Our most recent invoice to 
Enron  (dating from April) has not yet been paid.? Our accountant, Paul 
Hart,  reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to 
direct the  invoices says he is no longer the appropriate person to approve  
it.
?
Any  guidance on to whom we should turn?
?
All  the best,
?
Nelson

We spoke to Enron's accounting dept who said that the invoice  is still in 
their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices  have been 
sent)?said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The  accountant 
asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your  
thoughts.
