A "dedicated room" isn't as bad as it sounds.  It would not be in use full 
time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team 
rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already 
have).  Let me know what you think.  Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's 
move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she 
wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving 
deeper into her group (and next to her files)).

Steve and Mark:

eSpeak is gaining tremendous momentum to become the communication vehicle for 
Enron's business units. In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least 
one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally 
committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff 
Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in 
the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and 
Joe Hillings.

As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an 
incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the 
equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a 
dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor 
where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak 
session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the 
equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will 
be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work 
space.

We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new 
space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.

Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.

Sincerely,

The eThink Team
