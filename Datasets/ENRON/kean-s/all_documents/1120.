Please forward this to Steve Kean

The information we previously sent you was wrong based on information given 
by PG&E. Further investigation has lead to us discovering that the California 
Utilities do offer an option on all their rate schedules for all customer 
classes in which the customer can choose to install a real time meter and be 
subject to the hourly PX price.

The customer must pay for the meter (approx. $1,200) and all related metering 
activities: installation including the installation of an extra telephone 
line, maintenance and reading. 

If the customer chooses the PX Price Option, he/she will be billed the 
bundled amount credited the PX credit and added the actual usage/hour times 
PX hourly price.

However, it is very likely that very few customers and no bundled residential 
or small customers have chosen this option.
