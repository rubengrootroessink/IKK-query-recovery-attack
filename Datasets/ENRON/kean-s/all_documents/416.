Here's the latest on the Iowa customer choice bill--HF #2530. As some of you 
may have noticed in the trade press, there has started to be alot press 
releases from the opponents and proponents of the bill.  The opponents are 
bringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate, the proponents 
(that includes us) have been putting out positive  quotes from the School 
boards, the low income community action groups and the retail community.  
Radio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in 
outstate.  

It appears that floor debate will start next Monday, March 27th in the 
House.  It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with 
the hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that 
they can spend at least a week on the debate.

The Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed 
that moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to 
the legislators to either vote it up or down.  We believe that if the bill 
comes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will 
sign it.  

There are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has 
tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our 
business interests in Iowa with Enron Wind.  

As I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass 
until the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April.
