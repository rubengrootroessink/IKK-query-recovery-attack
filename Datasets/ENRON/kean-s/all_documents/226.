After talking with Kevin P., he said to change the sinks on the firm you want 
to TVA.  Joe and I will prepare to address the tariff issue at FERC (pro 
forma requires ultimate source and sink) to hopefully get the pro forma 
tariff changed.  Several other providers have raised this issue and backed 
off from the requirement.

Per out requests on Ameren from CE to TVA, we are confirmed on 50 mw's / 
month June-Sept. (With TVA our SINK).  We also have another 150 mw's /month 
July-Aug.  w/ CE source, TVA sink, that are in  "STUDY" mode.

Thanks for the update Bill.

I take issue with TVA's statement regarding denial of firm transmission to 
our CA's (Enron CA is the sink).   TVA is correct with their statement 
regarding netting of firm transmission (ie, very few transmission providers 
net firm transmission).  However, TVA, in the implementation of the NERC 
Policy letter, stated that they will make firm transmission available to and 
from each control area equal to the capacity capability of the generation and 
non-firm transmission availability from our control areas equal to TVA's own 
ATC to and from each interconnected control area.

TVA's denial of firm transmission sinking to our control area for the reason 
stated in Bill's e-mail is wrong.  Although the majority of our firm 
transmission requests utilize the 3 control areas as sources (with POD's of 
SOCO, EES, and AMRN), we should not tolerate denials of firm transmission 
into our control areas because that is completely inconsistent with the NERC 
Policy ruling.

By the way, what is the status of the transmission Terry requested from 
Com-Ed to TVA (through Ameren)?  This would be a situation where our control 
area would be a sink.  If TVA is, in fact, denying those firm transmission 
requests where we are the sink, we need to print out a hard copy of the OASIS 
denial and send a letter to NERC and FERC.  After further researching the 
facts, Christi could you please work with Bill to draft a letter, if 
necessary, to send to NERC.
