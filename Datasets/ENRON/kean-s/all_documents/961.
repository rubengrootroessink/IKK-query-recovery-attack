Palmisano left a couple of months ago to start his own business.  Jeff Keeler 
(in our DC office) is covering John's issues.

Thanks for the call this morning.  The convention sounds interesting.  On 
another note, I was wondering is John Palmisano still works here?  for you?  
I got a call from a conference organizer about an emissions meeting in 
Cologne, Ger. and I think he has spoken at this gathering.  I'll forward the 
email to you, and to the emissions/coal group as well to determine our 
interest.  

Regards.

Jeff
