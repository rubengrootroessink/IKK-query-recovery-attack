How much of an issue is this?  So far, Mark is the only one that has 
responded with a conflict.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Mark will be in Sydney, Australia at this time.  

FYI, he leaves for a loooong trip on May 12th and will not be back in the 
office until May 24th, and even then only for 1 day.  He'll be back in the 
office properly on June 5th (I know this is much more info than you need, but 
it might be useful!)
