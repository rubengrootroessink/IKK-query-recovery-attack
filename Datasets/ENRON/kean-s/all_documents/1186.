In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I 
think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management 
capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the 
ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned 
that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the 
commodity price guarantees.

Peggy:

Attached is the first draft of an announcement that we're targeting for 
release before market opening on Monday, August 28th.
It announces our entry into the New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets (and 
guess what, we're already beginning to sign up customers as of yesterday!).
We'd put it out on PR Newswire (nationally) as well as to all the key 
industry trades.

Please feel free to pass it along for comments to the usual crew at Enron.

Thanks!

Kathy
