Thanks for the referral.  We definitely want to get our story out to these 
guys.  Just for future reference, Meredith Phillipp is handling "New Media" 
for us.  Thanks

Subject: Interview Request

Hi guys.  My friend, Polly Traylor, is an editor at the Industry Standard in 
San Francisco.  One of her colleagues -- Michelle Rafter --  sent me the 
email below requesting an interview for an Enron story she is working on.  I 
have not spoken with this writer and am forwarding it to you for follow up. 

Hope all is well.  Call me if you have any questions.

Subject: Friend of Polly Traylors asking for a favor


Hi Janel:

My name is Michelle Rafter and I'm a writer for the Industry Standard. I work 
with Polly Traylor who
suggested that I contact you for help. I'd like to talk to someone at Enron 
for a story I'm doing
for the Standard on Internet CEOs, including CEOs or presidents who've led 
traditional companies
into successful Internet ventures. I first need to identify who at Enron that 
person would be, i.e.,
who's most responsible for the success of the company's Internet ventures: 
Jeffrey Skilling (he got
the most ink in BusinessWeek's story in this issue), Kenneth Lay, or the head 
of EnronOnline. Then I
need to talk to someone who could help coordinate a phone interview with me 
(I'm in Los Angeles so
this would be a phone interview). Can you give me some suggestions? Ideally, 
I'd love to do an
interview this week, but have some flexibility.

Thanks so much in advance for any help you can give.

Michelle Rafter
