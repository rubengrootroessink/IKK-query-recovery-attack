We just sent this back to TVA and SERC.  Based on TVA's 8/4/99 letter to NERC 
(in response to Jeff's 8/31 letter), it appears that TVA has no intention of 
agreeing to allow Enron to sink at the control areas.  Elizabeth and I will 
have the letter to Howard Hawk ready for 5:00 for Jeff.

Attached is a redlined version of Enron's response to TVA's proposal of this

revised the examples accordingly) and Enron will agree to remove the Gleason 
facility.  Christi Nicolay 713-853-7007  for Dick IngersollPlease use LAUNCH
