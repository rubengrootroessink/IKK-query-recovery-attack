Let's process this request.  I think it's justified.

I am in complete agreement with you..this was for a total of $150 and was 
given at the request of a powerful woman senator, who is the sponsor of this 
program..if it had been for more money I would have not have contributed, but 
the 17 women members that were there are of importance to us.
