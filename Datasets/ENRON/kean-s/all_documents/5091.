I think it's a good idea, but we will need a different summary ... either 
limit the summary to a couple of key points or provide an explanation, in 
layman's terms, of the practical effect of each of the changes.

What do you think of us sending out a U.S. Domestic employee mass e-mail 
asking our participants to lobby 
for passage of this very important bill.  I tried to make it more interesting 
than dry toast.

Let me know since this is heating up as you can see from the bulletin just 
received below.

p.s.  Obviously, I didn't get in enough protesting during my hippie years!





"In related news, the House Ways and Means Committee voted
35 to 6 to expand tax breaks for retirement savings plans.
The bill, which will go to the full House next week, would
increase the contribution level for IRAs from $2,000 to
$5,000, increase the annual dollar limits for 401(k) plans,
and allow employees over age 50 to "catch up" on pension
contributions they may have skipped when they were younger.
