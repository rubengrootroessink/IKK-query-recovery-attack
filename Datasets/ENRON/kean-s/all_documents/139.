We can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is 
focussed on developing IT systems for bulk power systems:

 We need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having 
IT solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work.
 The IT firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers (domestic and 
international)  whose decisions will make the IT firm's systems either 
successful or obsolete.
Call me if you would like to discuss.

To all--Steve Horn's Investment group has been approached to possibly invest 
in a company, Soft____, that makes EMS and tagging systems (which BPA is 
using and PGE may use).  We met w/ Shashi Patel of Steve's group today and 
discussed that there are competitors out there, including OATI, Alstom ESCA 
(who are partnered with Ross Perot).  Ross Perot has approached Enron about 
promoting its system in the Midwest ISO.   We used this system for Enron 
control area's EMS.  Ross Perot is going to contact Steve Kean to set up a 
meeting to show us his product.  Also, Kevin Presto thinks that OATI would be 
a good investment.

Steve Kean--Steve Horn and Shashi Patel are interested in being included in a 
presentation by Perot.

Sarah and Joe--Can you think of any FERC regulatory constraints that would 
limit Enron's ability to invest in one of the software providers to 
utilities/RTOS?  I couldn't think of any reason off hand. 

Thanks.

Steve/Joe/Sarah--See the attached memo from Alstom ESCA to Kevin Presto.  
Alstom ESCA did the Enron control area's (ENSE) EMS system that we needed to 
comply with NERC policies.  How should we proceed?  Thanks.

What are your thoughts?  I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe 
ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the 
Midwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to 
make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron 
supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The 
ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO 
that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary 
competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO 
environment (similar to California and PJM).

Kevin and Lloyd,

The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:
Allegheny Power
Ameren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)
CILCO
Cinergy
Commonwealth Edison
Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative
Illinois Power
Kentucky Utilities
Louisville Gas & Electric
Northern States Power
Wabash Valley Power
Wisconsin Electric

The status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is in
place with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view is
that a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only a
mandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERC
even a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.

At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirement
with grandfathered contracts in each is odious.

Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offer
is a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you might
expect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as Program
Manager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging and
Congestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCA
for the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters our
offering and provides more near-term opportunity.

Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharing
information with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand how
each side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.  Mutual
help and cooperation is to our partners, ESCA's and it would seem Enron's
advantage.
