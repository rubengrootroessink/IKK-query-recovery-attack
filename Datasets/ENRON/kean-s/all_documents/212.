I don't really have a problem with this, but I thought that all VP promotions 
were supposed to go through our year end process.  That's what I have been 
saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.  Ken, being newly back in 
the fold, likely didn't know about the process.

First I heard about this.  I assume it is a reward for the PTC extension.  
Hope it makes sense to you.
