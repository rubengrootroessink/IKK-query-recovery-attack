Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=
=20
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r=20
the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=
=20
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=
e=20
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=
=20
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=
.=20
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=
=20
established during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n=20
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=
=20
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98=20
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it=20
risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=
=20
time the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t=20
out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the=20
out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to=

sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted=20
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=
=20
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to=20
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the=20
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the=
=20
state's electricity since January.
?????At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us=
=20
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not goin=
g=20
to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in=
=20
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,=
=20
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since=
=20
May 31.
?????Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=
er=20
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that=20
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e=20
most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
=20
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is=20
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparentl=
y=20
drove away sellers, Hart said.
?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
=20
the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=
d=20
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=20
backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
=20
Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit =
of=20
the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
?????Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =
a=20
Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy=20
commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be a=
nd=20
when it should take effect. They got no answer.
?????Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to=20
clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations pow=
er=20
suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
?????Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=
t=20
is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price=
=20
of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped latel=
y.
?????Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators=

had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in=

agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower=
