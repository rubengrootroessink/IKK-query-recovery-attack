Steve:
Based on the note from Rosalee, and if you agree, I'm going to assign low 
priority to the issue.

Hi Steve and Jeff -

This was a cold call to Ken that Vanessa took while we were in Exec. Comm. 
meeting.  She had asked Ginger who to refer him to as it was CA. and she 
mentioned Jeff.  Please only call if there is any interest.

Rosie

It was not mentioned to me.  I'm copying rosie and vanessa to find out if 
this was a simple referral (in which case you should keep the work to a 
minimum -- return the call, but don't get distracted from your other efforts) 
or whether Ken is especially interested in this and wants us to follow 
through.

Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, 
Inc.  He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me 
to him.  He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the 
Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage 
investment in California's Enterprice Zones.  Before I launch on the effort, 
just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
