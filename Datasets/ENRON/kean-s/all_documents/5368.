FYI, if you haven't already seen this, Congressional Democrats on the 
Commerce Committee are leading an effort to send the attached letter to 
President Bush.

Thanks,

> 
>     Dear Mr. President:
> 
>         We are writing because our constituents and millions of
> Americans across the West need your intervention at the Federal Energy
> Regulatory Commission (FERC) in order to address serious problems with the
> Western energy market. 
> 
>         As you know, California has been experiencing an electricity
> crisis that has resulted in blackouts throughout the state, inconvenienced
> millions of citizens and businesses, and disrupted the state's and
> region's economy.  Indeed, this crisis seriously threatens to cause
> long-term damage to the economy of California, the Western region, and
> perhaps the entire country.
> 
>         The crisis is the result of a dysfunctional energy market
> where wholesale prices of electricity have spiked exorbitantly.  For
> example, wholesale prices on December 15, 2000, ranged from $429 per Mwh
> to $565 per Mwh, compared to prices from $12 per Mwh to $29 per Mwh one
> year earlier.  Wholesale prices have jumped as high as $1400 per Mwh.  In
> fact, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the state's power
> grid operator, has projected that electricity which cost $7 billion in
> 1999 will cost $70 billion this year.  These skyrocketing prices can only
> partly be explained by natural gas price increases and increased energy
> demand.
> 
>         These exorbitant price spikes have led FERC Commissioner
> William L. Massey to state on February 8, 2001:
> 
>         These high prices serve only to continue a massive wealth
> transfer out of the region.  Is it worth dragging down an entire regional
> economy, or perhaps even the national economy, for the theoretical purity
> of unfettered price signals?  I say no.  I call on my fellow commissioners
> to consider a time out now.  It's our statutory obligation. . . .  FERC's
> timidity  and hands-off approach is eroding consumer confidence and
> destroying the consensus that heretofore supported a market based
> approach.  
> 
> 
>         The dysfunctional nature of the market has apparently
> allowed it to be manipulated.  The California ISO last week presented FERC
> with findings of a comprehensive study of pricing data in California's
> wholesale electricity market over the last 10 months.  According to the
> Los Angeles Times, the ISO's study found "evidence of market manipulation
> and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs" and that "suppliers
> commonly offered electricity at twice their costs."  The ISO has estimated
> the cost of the potential overcharges between May 2000 and last month are
> high as $6.3 billion.    
> 
>         Unfortunately, FERC actions have fallen far too short.  To
> date, FERC has not aggressively worked to address market manipulations,
> despite finding last fall that wholesale prices were not "just and
> reasonable."  Nor is FERC apparently willing to seriously consider
> addressing runaway wholesale rates.
> 
>         The state of California is taking heroic measures, but this
> is an issue California cannot address alone.  In a February 28, 2001,

        Mr. President, we request that you help protect California's
economy, and indeed that of the Western region and the nation.  Please
support the Governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent
allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity
market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's
economy.

                        Sincerely,
