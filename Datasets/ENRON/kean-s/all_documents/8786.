Maureen:

Ginger asked me to forward this summary to you, and that Steve asked you to 
send it to others.  Please note that the attached summary is just the first 
in several to come today, and I will send them to you as we finish them.  
However, the PJM one is probably the most important one, so it's a good one 
to get out early.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Sarah
