Mike - perhaps you can help me or forward this on to someone who can.  The 
people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are 
specifically dedicated to certain business units.  As a consequence, we have 
ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people.  Due to the 
fine efforts of your team, many people in my group have migrated over to the 
Enron Corp LAN.  We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & 
Russell (Servat and Mitchell).  As the IT guy, I'm sure you are accustomed to 
such profuse praise.

However, many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN.  
Historically, EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too 
have been doing a fine job in that regard.  Historically, therefore, we have 
not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year.  In 
the meantime, when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the 
CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our current
equipment or give it back to EES.  If you need me to, I can explain in detail 
why this makes no sense.
