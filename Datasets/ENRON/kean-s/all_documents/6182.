As indicated in my message earlier today, we have sent notice to the 
government of Maharashtra drawing on the state guarantee to cover the 
remaining past due bill for November (there is an additional 7 day wait 
before we can take action on the December bill).  The amount involved is 89 
crore (approximately $19 million).  We definitely expect press 
interest/coverage, The Standard in Delhi evidently has the story, but the 
wires have not picked up on it yet.  Attached are the statement and Q&As that 
will be used to respond to any inquiries.
