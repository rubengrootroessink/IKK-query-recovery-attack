Nick Lampson called and asked for a contribution.  I committed to one without 
knowing about his vote on PNTR.  I will keep my word by making an individual 
contribution but will also communicate to him that in my capacity as Enron 
PAC chair i cannot authorize the PAC to make a contribution as a result of 
that vote.

Sorry I jumped the gun.
