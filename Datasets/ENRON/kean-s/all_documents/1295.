Subject: SPP interconnection procedures

On 7/31/00, FERC approved SPP's interconnection procedures.  Items of 
interest:

Third party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and 
Customer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in 
any instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion.
The current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if 
someone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing 
customer should pay for any new studies required by others.)
While SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 
days, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is 
reasonably needed.)
If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs 
of upgrades that are needed "but for" the interconnection.  However, once 
transmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the 
network upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the 
expansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines.  
Typically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to 
the interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on 
OASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which 
benefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all 
customers.

Let me know if you would like a copy of the order.
