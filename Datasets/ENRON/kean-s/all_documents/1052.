I believe we should back Massey as well.  Who do we weigh in with now?

Steve/Rick/Jim  ---  Talked to John Anderson yesterday.  He had just gotten 
off the phone with Massey.  Massey believes Linda B.  is spending time at the 
White House lobbying to be Chair.   Have we decided whether to back either 
and if so which?  I would prefer backing Massey.  Thoughts?   JOE

Joe,

As you are probably aware, Jim Hoecker is considering leaving FERC
relatively soon.  The President will then name a new Chairman.  Bill Massey
is quite interested in receiving the nomination.

Please call to discuss.

John
