?    Gore focuses on Social Security
?    Gore meets with South African President Thabo Mbeki
?    The NRA guns for the presidency
?    Houston Chronicle columnist Donald Kaul on Bush's Texas Leadership

GORE FOCUSES ON SOCIAL SECURITY, CHINA TRADE

Speaking in Washington today, Al Gore called for Social Security reform
that preserves the basic guarantee of retirement security.  The Gore
plan
will keep Social Security solvent through at least 2050, while Bush is
pushing a risky privatization scheme.  Under the Bush plan, poor
investment
choices by some individuals or a downturn in the stock market could
force
taxpayers to bailout those who lost money.

GORE MEETS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI

At a State Department luncheon, Al Gore met with South African President
Thabo Mbeki to discuss trade, the AIDS epidemic, and other concerns with
the African subcontinent.  Gore has proposed strengthening economic
engagement with Africa, which will lead to greater prosperity and
international security.

George Bush, however, takes a dim view of Africa, stating Africa
"doesn't
fit into the national strategic interests, as far as I can seen them."
[PBS
"NewsHour" 2/16/00]

THE NRA GUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY

Meeting in Charlotte this weekend, Charlton Heston fired up the faithful
with fear and belligerence, telling Al Gore and other "divisive forces"
(gun safety advocates) that they could have his guns when they take them
"from my cold dead hands."

Wayne LaPierre, NRA Executive VP, attacked the Million Mom March,
instead
calling last week's rally of concerned parents, the "Misled Mom March."

Reaffirming that Governor Bush is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA,
top
officials declared they would throw all of the group's resources behind
the
Texas Governor.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE QUESTIONS BUSH'S LEADERSHIP

On Saturday, Houston Chronicle columnist Donald Kaul questioned Bush's
leadership, explaining "he has spent his life being rescued for his
family's rich friends from one failed business deal after another."

Among Kaul's criticisms of Mr. Bush:

Texas ranks near the tops of the charts in every bad category:
?    poverty rates, teen pregnancies, people without insurance, air
pollution, executions
Texas ranks near the bottom in all the good categories:
?    the environment, public health, parks and recreation, highways and
support for the arts

The one place where Bush has shown leadership is in working tirelessly
to
cut state taxes of the well-to-do.
?    He has protected the oil refiners which dump 1 million tons of
pollution into the Texas air annually
?    He pushed a $1.2 billion property tax cut, despite the fact that
Texas
schools are starved for cash

?    Bush's Social Security plan would hurt women
?    Required Reading: NYT Herbert ? "Are You Feeling Lucky?"

BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN WOULD HURT WOMEN

?    Women Would Be the "Largest Group of Losers" Under Privatization.
John Mueller, the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of Lehrman
Bell
Mueller Cannon, Inc. and former adviser to Rep. Jack Kemp, testified
before
the House Social Security Subcommittee that "the largest group of losers
from 'privatizing' Social Security would be women.  This is true for
women
in all birth-years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of
labor-market
behavior, and all income levels."

?    Privatization Plans Exacerbate the Already Unequal Distribution of
Retirement Benefits.  According to the statement of Jane Ross, Director
of
Income Security issues at the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO),
Social
Security reform plans that incorporate private accounts exacerbate the
already unequal distribution of retirement benefits under Social
Security.
["Social Security Reform: Implications for the Financial Well-Being of
Women," Statement of Jane L. Ross, GAO, 4/10/97]

?    Privatization Plans a Threat to Women's Long-Term Security.
Privatization would transform today's  guaranteed retirement benefits
into
a risky program that could threaten women's retirement security, since
women are more likely to rely on Social Security for their primary
source
of retirement benefits.

?    Women rely on Social Security because
(1)  half of all women work in jobs that don't offer pensions;
(2)  women retirees with pensions receive half the average pensions
benefits that men collect;
(3)  nearly three out of four women earn less than $30,000 a year. Women
&
Retirement Security: An Overview," WISER,
     3/10/00, "Viewpoint: Legislative Agenda for the 106th Congress,
"Social Security Privatization," National Committee to
     Preserve Social Security and Medicare, "Women and Retirement
Security," www.ssa.gov]

HERBERT FROM TODAY'S NYT: DO YOU FEEL LUCKY?

Bob Herbert today deconstructed the various arguments for why Bush's
privatization scheme is too risky.

1) Even his chief economic advisor doesn't trust the market:


"Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax
cut
and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned
his
private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to
a
recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he
would
be able "to sleep at night."


Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security
retirement
benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their
Social
Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the
moment, wants no part of."


2) Herbert also questioned Bush's motives, noting that Bush's Wall
Street
contributors would make out like bandits under his plan.


"There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan
--
the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been
funneling
many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other
politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions
of
dollars in Social Security taxes their way.


Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this
welfare scheme for the not-so-idle rich.


3) He explained the chronology of Republicans trying to do away with
Social
Security


"Face it, the Republicans have had it in for Social Security since its
inception. The historian William Manchester wrote about the G.O.P.'s
desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation: "On radio spots, actors
hired by the Republican National Committee revealed in shocked tones
that
each man would be given a number -- as though there were any other way
to
keep track of Social Security accounts -- and perpetrated the hoax that
people would be fingerprinted."


When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, party leaders
called
for the repeal of Social Security. And nearly four decades later,
Governor
Bush's fellow Texan, Senator Phil Gramm, could be quoted as follows on
the
question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly:


"They are 80-year-olds. Most people don't have the luxury of living to
be
80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for them."

?    Gore challenges Bush to Social Security debate at AARP conference
in
Orlando
?    Bush's Secret Plan Revealed!
?    Bush continues to face fire over privatization plan
?    Middle and low income workers worse-off under Texas alternative to
Social Security

GORE CHALLENGES BUSH TO SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE AT AARP CONFERENCE IN
ORLANDO

Addressing approximately 10,000 seniors at the AARP's Biennial
Convention,
Al Gore today challenged George W. Bush to hold a debate, "as soon as
possible," on their competing Social Security proposals. Gore has called
for Social Security reform "based not on stock market speculation, but
on
fiscal responsibility and debt reduction." Bush is pushing the partial
privatization of Social Security, but has provided no specific details.

BUSH WOULD COMPLETELY PRIVATIZE  SOCIAL SECURITY

George Bush has revealed that his "secret plan" for Social Security is
an
attempt to completely dismantle and privatize the 65-year system of
social
insurance, according to reports in the New York Times, the Associated
Press, and the Houston Chronicle.

The Chronicle reports that "Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush on Tuesday said his plan to create private savings accounts could
be
the first step toward a complete privatization of Social Security."

"It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal
savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle,"
Bush
said. "This is a step toward a completely different world, and an
important
step."

Bush admits that the individual private accounts are but the first step
in
his larger plan to privatize the program.  This may be good for the
stockbrokers who have poured $3 million into his Presidential campaign,
but
it is a horrible deal for America.

BUSH PLAN PANNED IN THE PRESS

Bush's privatization plan has come under fire from responsible
journalists
and editorial pages across the country.

A New York Daily News editorial writes:
"On the future of Social Security, the presidential candidates have
offered
stark choices. Bush would destroy the program; Gore would save it. Easy
choice."

Paul Krugman addresses the current concern about the stock market being
overvalued at present:
"If you think that stocks are currently overpriced, this [the Bush]
proposal sounds like a recipe for disaster: it will encourage workers to
buy stocks at exactly the wrong time -- eventually leading to an even
worse
Social Security crisis, as the government finds itself under intense
pressure to bail out the baby boomers."

TEXAS ALTERNATIVE TO SOCIAL SECURITY HURTS RETIREES

The Baltimore Sun today revealed that three Texas counties which opted
out
of the Social Security system in the early 1980s in favor of private
investments.  According to the Sun, many of the counties' 3,000
employees ?
especially low- to middle-income workers ? will actually earn less money
than if they had stuck with Social Security.

While wealthier workers might have done better under privatization,
middle
and low-wage workers did significantly worse.  According to a GAO
report, a
low-wage County employee working for 35 years would earn $1,125 a month
under Social Security, but as little as $542 under the privatized plan.

So much for Bush's plan to help poorer Americans.
