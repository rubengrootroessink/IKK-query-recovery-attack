Ken hasn't mentioned it.  I'll ask next time I talk to him.

Subject: Purported Ken Lay Promise to Haley Barbour

Pat Shortridge heard from the Executive Director of the Republican Senate 
Campaign Committee that Haley Barbour, the new finance chair for the 
Committee, had called Ken to request that he serve as a Finance 
Co-Chairman.   Pat was told that Ken agreed.  Have you heard of this call and 
did Ken agree?Thanks
