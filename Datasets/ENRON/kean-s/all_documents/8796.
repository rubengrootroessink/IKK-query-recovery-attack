Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading 
activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its 
official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and 
Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two 
major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into 
the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow 
process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the 
role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to 
become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The 
newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on 
LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale 
Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access 
LegalOnline:

If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures 
during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although 
you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised 
Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the 
Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so 
within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will 
allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with 
your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the 
Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna 
Lowry at extension 3-1939.
