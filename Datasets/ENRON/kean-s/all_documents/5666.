Steve:

Need to met with you before May 8th, but would like to do it in the next 2 
weeks,  to discuss Enron's position on this NPC report.  I am currently 
coordinating with Andrew Parsons, Mark Holsworth etc.  Rob sent me a copy of 
the 2 Feb 2001 NPC update letter and draft executive summary received by Ken 
Lay.  I sent Rob a note outlining the questions I saw the report raising form 
an Enron perspective.  Comments below.

This is important enough to get Steve Kean's direction just to make sure all 
the right people are in the loop.  I am not the right person, although Lay 
sent me a note on it.

Rob:

Thought I'd send you the latest draft of the report, it's 85-90%  final (the 
recommendations are 100%).

Questions the report raises for Enron:

Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance 
sector?  Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks 
to IT systems.  The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an 
information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year.  Discussions 
with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value.  

If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a 
leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member 
companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on 
number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as 
$13K per year.  An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the 
LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed.  Archie Dunham, 
CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council 
recommends it at the 6 June  meeting.

Current coordination:

The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO.  
Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative.  Recent DOJ action 
regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that 
anti-trust will not be an issue.  Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a 
review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them.

Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, 
and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT 
protection efforts in next two weeks. 

Recommendation:

Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As 
Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides 
tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a "one-stop-shop" format 
is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.
