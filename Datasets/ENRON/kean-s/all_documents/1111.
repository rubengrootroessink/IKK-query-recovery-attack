Steve,

Thanks for your voice mail the other day.  Your memo certainly helped in 
better understanding the situation.  Locally, we have not seen any additional 
articles on CA or on dereg, but will let you know if we do. I will also take 
onboard your other comments.  I speak with Mark tomorrow to go over Nick's 
review.

thanks,

Joe
