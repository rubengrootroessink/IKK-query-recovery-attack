Rice University's 9th Annual Recruiter Chili Cook-Off
Thursday, Oct. 5th    Ray Courtyard, Student Center
4pm-6pm



If you haven't done so already, make sure to fax over your form for
our annual Recruiter Chili Cook-Off.  This is a great opportunity to
meet with students in an informal setting.  The students taste your
chili and then they vote for the best.  It's held 2 hours before the
Rice vs. Fresno game.  There will be free hotdogs, sodas, and beer
for everyone.  A zydeco band will provide the entertainment and each
company will be given 4 complimentary football tickets for the 6pm
game.  It's a lot of fun!  Don't miss out!

Some of our past winners include:  Andersen Consulting, Enron, DSC
Communications, and CSC Consulting
