Attached herewith please find Chairman Bliley's letter to his House Commerce 
Committee members outlining the process and content for full committee 
mark-up upon Congress' return from the July 4th break; the section-by-section 
on transmission plus the actual transmission legislative language are also 
attached.  H.R. 2944 is the underlying bill to which these changes are made.

We have made substantial progress just this week.  We will need to be 
diligent to determine which amendments will be offered in July and to guard 
against those we oppose.  Commerce Committee members are continuing their 
meetings this evening to further plan the upcoming mark-up.

The Senate Reliability bill will likely not be considered until Congress 
reconvenes in July.  Several Democrat Senators have now placed holds.  Under 
the Senate Rules, just one Member can block bill consideration under the hold 
process.  At this point, the hold is process vs. substance.

July will be the most critical month in order for us to realize bill 
enactment this Congress.
