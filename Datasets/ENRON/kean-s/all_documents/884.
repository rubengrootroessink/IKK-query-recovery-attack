 Jon

Ken Lay is going to be attending a multi CEO meeting with President - elect 
Fox on August 24.  They will be discussing a number of issues regarding 
energy, telecom, commerce ... etc.  He needs a one page briefing sheet on our 
activities in Mexico sometime in the next week or so.  Please put together 
something and work through Steve Kean's group to give Ken the info.

Thanks

Ken
