the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I 
don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of 
messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as 
a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop 
such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson, 
Fleischman-Hillard, Divall, etc.

I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however, 
(and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly).
