Subject: Media Alert: Arbitration with Reliance and ONGC  

Just happened to pick up from a third source that Shantanu, Principal 
Correspondent in Delhi of 'The Telegraph' is doing  a story today about the 
arbitration. So far he has not called in for our participation and I am 
refraining from being proactive. While the eastern centric  'Telegraph'  is 
Calcutta's largest daily, we can expect further pick up thereon with possible 
media querries tomorrow onwards. As advised, I will forward such querries to 
John Ambler.
