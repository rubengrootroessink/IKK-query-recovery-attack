Attached are three documents for your consideration:

--Q and As if there is a leak about the possible sale, but we don't want to 
admit it (qanoadmit)

--News release if the leak runs amok and it is determined that we must 
divulge--either for shareholder reasons or severe reputation 
problems/miconceptions.  (leaknr)

--Q and As to accompany news release.  I suppose another option is having a 
statement and Q and As ready without a release, but I don't think this gives 
us the control we would need.  (qaadmit)

Please review and comment by end of next week.  Thanks.
