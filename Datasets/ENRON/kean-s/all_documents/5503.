The memo going out on Monday discusses the corporate policy committee brief=
ly=20
at the end.  The corporate policy committee does the MD PRC (evaluation of=
=20
MDs and promotions to MD), reviews the recommendations of the other=20
committees (which we are just now forming).  Additionally, the corporate=20
policy committee met to determine the membership and charters of the other=
=20
committees (including the PRC committees).  The corporate policy committee =
is=20
comprised of the most senior executives, including the Office of the=20
Chairman, the leaders of the four business units and the heads of the=20
corporate functions.  In addition to the specific items mentioned above, th=
e=20
corporate policy committee was intended to discuss and resolve the major=20
issues facing the company, including issues of strategy, personnel and=20
challenges facing the company. =20

The corporate policy committee has met three times so far, so not much=20
history yet.  Perhaps as further pronouncements issue from this august body=
,=20
we will make more of a point about where they came from.

employees who forget what they read or who do not read their emails.  Too=

late for this one.  I will get Steve to give me a short description.
