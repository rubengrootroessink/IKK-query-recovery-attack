Dear Sir and Madam.

I did not know whom to contact at Enron, so chose to contact you.  I am a 
Ph.D candidate at the University of Rhode Island.  My speciality is English 
and Business Communication.

I am contacting you because I a person I know has applied and given a 
high-end position within your company.  Please check his credentials.  He is 
presenting himself as a Brown University Graduate with an MBA from another 
college.

Please be advised, I did a reference check with Brown, and he is not a Brown 
graduate.  His name is Steven R. Hill.  

I feel obliged to divulge this information to you because of the law that 
holds me responsible for knowing that someone might be purposely 
misrepresenting themselves.

Mary K. Cardinale
