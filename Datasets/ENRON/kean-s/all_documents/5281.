Judge Dismisses Complaints by Groups To Stop NYPA From
Opening Plants

Associated Press

A Brooklyn judge ruled Friday that the New York Power
Authority can proceed with plans to open nine new
metropolitan area power plants, rejecting the complaints
of a coalition of consumer groups.

The decision by state Supreme Court Justice Lawrence
Knipel came just two days after a Queens judge had blocked
the opening of two of the gas turbine generators in the
Long Island City section of Queens.

The anti-power plant groups "failed to demonstrate that
[NYPA] abused their discretion or violated any rule of
law" in efforts to open the plants, Judge Knipel wrote in
his 76-page decision.

NYPA and the other groups named in the suit "exercised a
level of care sufficient to pass legal muster" Judge
Knipel continued.

Mike Petralia, spokesman for the New York Power Authority,
hailed the judge's decision as "a good day for all New
York City residents. Now we can move forward to get the
plants operational, and keep the lights on this summer."

Mr. Petralia said NYPA hopes to have the plants up and
running by early June. The plants are scheduled to open in
Brooklyn, Queens, the South Bronx and Brentwood on Long
Island.

Power Plant (April 5)
Jason Babbie of the New York Public Interest Group, one of
the groups seeking to keep the plants from opening, said
his group was unsure if it would appeal this latest
decision.

"We are considering an appeal," said Mr. Babbie, the
environmental policy analyst for NYPIRG. "We are upset
about the decision. ... The government has spent money, in
effect, fighting against its own people."

The Brooklyn ruling does not supersede the earlier ruling
in Queens, according to both sides, since the two suits
were filed on different grounds. "There is no green
light," said Mr. Babbie.

According to Mr. Petralia, NYPA is in negotiations with
residents of the Queens neighborhood to clear the way for
those plants to become operational. Opponents included
Silvercup Studios, which produces the HBO series, "The
Sopranos."

The New York Power Authority has said it must get the
plants running by summer to ensure reliable electrical
service and avoid price spikes. NYPA officials warn that
New Yorkers could face the same problem currently
afflicting California unless something is done.
