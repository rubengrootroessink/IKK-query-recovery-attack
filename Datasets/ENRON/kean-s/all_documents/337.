David,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I'd absolutely like to talk with you about 
applications and potential content for these screens.  As you know, we've 
been interested in creating an electronic bulletin board to promote upcoming 
activities for CR.  I'd like to do something similar for general HR news as 
well.  If that's "doable", I'd love to talk more.  Let me know your 
availability next week.

Terrie

I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions (13th 
floor graphics) to provide content digitization, encoding and storage for 
video productions.  They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta 
SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic 
multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel.  Additional costs would be 
incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video 
content for the monitors.  Enron would then have a choice of vendors, 
including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others.

We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the "head-end" of the 
video signal for these and any other building monitors.  I don't know if your 
estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, 
modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, 
etc.  Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content 
for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have.

Finally, someone will have to "own" the channel and pre-approve content for 
distribution.  I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the 
content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, 
or create any overkill.

I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of 
this project.  Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses 
related to creating content rather than capital outlay.

Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing 
what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me?

DMM

Beth, Mark - 

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

Let me know next steps.  We can discuss funding sources.  - Bill
