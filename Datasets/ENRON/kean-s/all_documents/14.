Panel discussion - Bill Darcy is the other panelist, will give overview and 
do a defensive speech.  You can discuss opportunities and give offensive 
speech.  He doesn't know how many people to expect, but will introduce you to 
some of the big people there.  He'll be passing out an outline of his point 
of view; you can use overheads, handouts, whatever you like.  Time is not yet 
set.
