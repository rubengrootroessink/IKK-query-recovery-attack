I've got Ken Lay tentatively scheduled to speak to Town Hall Los Angeles on 
Tuesday, Aug. 7.  They were thrilled to hear that Ken had an interest in 
speaking to the group, and Jim McNulty with Parsons immediately recognized 
Ken and wants him to speak about the "big energy picture," given Enron's 
global perspective.  They've got a pretty heavy energy calendar in the next 
few months:
 May 16 - Phil Angelides
 June 19 - John Bryson
 July 11 - Steve Ledbetter
 July 26 - Loretta Lynch

You may want to attend these luncheons just to see what  these four have to 
say.  I've asked if Warren Olney could do the interview w/ Ken, and Adrian 
Medawar said she'd call him.

Sandra -- would you check with LABA to see if we could do that meeting the 
same trip (either before or after Town Hall).

Great job lining this one up -- thank you!

See you in San Fran.
