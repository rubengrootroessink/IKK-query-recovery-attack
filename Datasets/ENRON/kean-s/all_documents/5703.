California. This document was obtained from www.governor.ca.gov.)

GOVERNOR DAVIS SENDS LETTER TO SECRETARY OF ENERGY ABRAHAM

February 26, 2001

The Honorable Spencer Abraham
Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20585

Re: Update on California's Energy Efforts

Dear Secretary Abraham:

The purpose of this letter is to update you on California's significant ene=
rgy
conservation and efficiency efforts, as well as our generation development
initiatives.

Energy Conservation and Efficiency

Estimates by the California Energy Commission indicate that the State as a=
=20
whole
used approximately 2,000 fewer megawatts in January 2001 than might have be=
en
expected, absent conservation and efficiency efforts. As you know, since
January, we have implemented the following major initiatives:

Directing more than $800 million for programs to improve conservation and
efficiency.

Implementing aggressive conservation measures in state buildings, resulting=
 in
about 200 MW of savings during energy emergencies.

Developing a comprehensive outreach and education campaign to reach=20
businesses,
organizations, and millions of California consumers.

Partnering with other governmental entities, including school districts to
ensure that all 475 cities, 58 counties, and 8,300 schools in California=20
reduce
consumption.

Adopting the strongest energy efficiency standards in the world for=20
residential
and non-residential buildings and appliances.

Incorporating energy efficient, sustainable building designs in new state
building projects.

Issuing 13 Governor's Executive Orders on energy.

Additional State Conservation Outreach Efforts

The State Department of Consumer Affairs has launched the first stage of a =
$20
million paid media campaign to encourage California's consumers and busines=
ses
to conserve energy and become more energy efficient. The first three=20
commercials
have run in all 12 major metropolitan markets, the most recent of which
encourages consumers to turn down their thermostats.
We are coordinating our conservation efforts with many businesses and busin=
ess
associations. For example, Safeway agreed to print an energy conservation
message on its supermarket grocery bags. In addition, it will place an ener=
gy
conservation message in its weekly advertisement insert, which reaches 11
million households in every major California newspaper each week. Safeway a=
lso
has offered to donate 10 to 15 seconds on its advertising buys for the stat=
e
energy conservation message. In addition, McDonald's is placing four millio=
n
tray liners with the energy conservation message in its 1,100 restaurants
throughout the State.

The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) puts conservation and efficiency=20
messages
on Vehicle Registration and Driver's License Application and Renewal=20
envelopes.
DMV envelopes are expected to the reach 19.6 million vehicle owners and eig=
ht
million drivers who apply for or renew licenses this year.
The approaching tax season has enabled the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to rea=
ch
nearly 300,000 Californians a week with the energy message. This past week
alone, FTB included an energy insert in nearly 24,000 Return Information
Notices, reached 71,000 visitors to the FTB home page, which features the=
=20
energy
conservation message, and played a recorded energy conservation message for
nearly 193,000 taxpayers who used the FTB call center.

The California Lottery Commission is placing conservation messages on certa=
in
game tickets and on 7,000 television monitors in stores throughout the Stat=
e.
The Department of Consumer Affairs, the Franchise Tax Board, California Ene=
rgy
Commission, and other agencies play energy conservation information during =
on-
hold telephone messages.

The Department of Consumer Affairs reached an estimated 2.5 million=20
Californians
with the energy conservation and efficiency message during Consumer Protect=
ion
Week through public appearances, media interviews, handouts, and letters.

The Governor's Office of Planning and Research has worked with your Departm=
ent
of Energy to get the conservation message to all federal employees and
facilities in California. These communications will reach as many as 265,00=
0
civilian employees and 100,000 military personnel in California. Distributi=
on=20
is
provided by the Department of Energy's Seattle Regional Office to key facil=
ity
managers and other federal offices throughout the state.

Every state agency website features the state's "Flex Your Power" logo and
energy conservation message. For example, the Energy Commission's home page
features in-depth conservation and efficiency information and receives 3=20
million
hits a month. The Energy Commission also has established an 800 number and =
web
form to handle consumer conservation ideas and inventions. This allows peop=
le=20
to
make suggestions directly to government.

Articles on energy conservation have been placed in trade publications and
newsletters, such as the Employment Development Department's California
Employer, which reached some 900,000 employers, and the CalPERS PERSpective=
s,
which reached one million subscribers.

The Technology, Trade, and Commerce Agency e-mailed and broadcast faxed an
energy conservation letter to approximately 97,000 businesses, associations=
,=20
and
partners.

The California Science Center, a state museum in Los Angeles that has 1.3
million visitors a year, including 800,000 children, is providing conservat=
ion
tips in English and Spanish to all visitors.

Two weeks ago, I issued an Executive Order that requires retail=20
establishments,
particularly shopping malls, gas stations, auto dealerships, and other
commercial properties, to reduce unnecessary outdoor lighting during non-
business hours. The Executive Order is directed at the large banks of=20
decorative
and marketing illumination that often stay on all night and do not serve a
public safety function.

Quantifying Impact of Outreach Efforts

The State and Consumer Services Agency is working with the Electricity=20
Oversight
Board, the California Energy Commission, the Department of General Services=
,=20
and
cabinet agencies to attempt to quantify the impact of our outreach efforts =
on
energy efficiency and conservation. Preliminary estimates for January 2001
indicate that the State experienced an overall reduction of approximately=
=20
2,000
megawatts from what the State's overall anticipated load should have been,
absent recent conservation and efficiency efforts. This estimate measured
overall impact by comparing monthly peak load data against data from the sa=
me
month one year earlier, while adjusting for projected load growth from last=
=20
year
to this year, significant changes in weather conditions, and other factors.

In addition, we are attempting to measure the overall impact of state agenc=
y
conservation efforts by gathering monthly utility bills of state buildings =
and
facilities and comparing them to the same month in 2000. Some preliminary
highlights include:


The DGS Telecommunications headquarters at 601 Sequoia Pacific Blvd.
(Sacramento) consumed 20.5% less kilowatt hours of electricity in January 2=
001
when compared with data from January 2000.

The Office of State Publishing facility at 344 N. 7th Street (Sacramento)
consumed 26.6% less kilowatt hours of electricity in January 2001 when=20
compared
with data from January 2000.

Caltrans indicated that the electricity bill for its Sacramento headquarter=
s
went down 23.8% last month, compared with January 2000.
The Department of Housing and Community Development reports a 40.5% reducti=
on=20
in
energy usage at its Sacramento headquarters building.

Generation Development Initiatives

Objective: 5,000 MW on line by July, and 20,000 MW by 2004.

Since August 2000, I have issued a series of Executive Orders and signed=20
urgency
legislation that created:

Fast-track licensing procedures for environmentally-preferred facilities; s=
ome
plants will be licensed in as little as 21 days

A State Air Emissions offset bank so fast track plants can obtain air permi=
ts=20
up
front.

Ability to increase power production at existing facilities and to allow
construction of plants 24/7.

ISO outage scheduling tools so shut downs occur while system reliability is
maintained

Intergovernmental "Green Team" strike force to cut red tape at federal, sta=
te
and local levels.

Performance awards for plants that accelerate construction and come on-line
before July, 2001.

I have requested that President Bush direct federal agencies to expedite=20
federal
permit reviews for power projects; President Bush granted this request.

I have written Chairman Hebert to urge the FERC to further extend the waive=
r=20
of
certain operating and efficiency restrictions on qualifying facilities from
April 30, 2001 until October 15, 2001; California awaits the Chairman's
response.

I anticipate that by July, 2001, these measures will result in the addition=
 of
1,320 MW from three large power plants, a 320 MW plant licensed under=20

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Makes Partial Payments to Suppliers
3/1/1 9:32 (New York)

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Makes Partial Payments to Suppliers

     (For more on the California power crisis, see {EXTRA <GO>})

     New York, March 1 (Bloomberg) -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
California's largest investor-owned utility, will make partial
payments of $228 million instead of $1.442 billion to its
suppliers, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
said.
     Kent Harvey, a senior vice president and chief financial
officer at the utility, told investors in a Feb. 1 conference call
that the utility was paying power suppliers 15 percent of invoices
received. The company would rather ``make partial payments than no
payments at all, to keep electricity flowing to customers,'' he
said.
     The cash-strapped utility, which has defaulted on more than
$731 million of commercial paper since Jan. 17, is conserving
money in order to stave off filing for bankruptcy protection.
     Pacific Gas & Electric paid soaring wholesale energy prices
since last summer, which California regulators prohibited it from
passing on to customers. The utility accumulated $6.6 billion of
debt through the end of 2000 for such power purchases. The filing
didn't update the undercollections through January.
     Edison International's Southern California Edison, the
state's No. 2 utility, has said its unreimbursed costs were $5.47
billion through January 31. Sempra Energy's totaled $605 million.

                        Some Power Payments

     Pacific Gas and Electric's filing said it is making partial
payments for January power deliveries from certain suppliers,
known as qualifying facilities, and for December deliveries from
the California Independent System Operator, which oversees about
75 percent of the state's transmission grid.
     As of Jan. 16, the utility had drawn $938 million of a $1
billion credit line. On Jan. 17, banks refused to lend the utility
additional money causing it to default on maturing commercial
paper. The utility and its parent, PG&E Corp., have been shut out
of the commercial paper markets and unable to raise money from
sources other than banks since late December.
     Pacific Gas & Electric has an additional $142 million of
commercial paper maturing by the end of this month, according to
an audit ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission. It
recently had $1 billion of cash reserves, based on a Feb. 14 SEC
filing.
     California Governor Gray Davis has proposed buying the
utilities' transmission systems as part of a broader plan,
including buying power on their behalf, to help PG&E and Edison
avoid bankruptcy.

Highlights of This Issue

Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sell-side and rating
agency analysts in New York yesterday.  The Governor outlined his plan for
restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their
obligations.  Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting.

Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure

The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities'
problems within the context of their existing rate structures. He indicated
that the temporary 9% rate hike from January 2000 would be made permanent a=
nd
that a 10% rate reduction that went into effect in January 1998 would be
reversed in March 2002.

Status of Negotiations with PG&E

As we noted in a February 26(**th) comment, the Governor has reached an
agreement in principle with Southern California Edison (EIX: B3/CC) to addr=
ess
that utility's past under-collections.  He hopes to also have an agreement=
=20
with
PG&E within the next 30 days, suggesting that progress was made in particul=
ar
in the last 2-3 days.  However, the Governor acknowledged that reaching an
agreement with PG&E was more difficult due to its larger under-collected
balance and lower rates compared with SCE.

Some Generators Agree to Haircut

The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily
agreed to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for their past due
receivables. When pressed about which parties they've had constructive
discussions with, he identified Williams (WMB: Baa2/BBB-), Enron (ENE:
Baa1/BBB+) and Dynegy (DYN: Baa2/BBB+).  We note that most of the generator=
s
and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against
possible losses.  Importantly, the Governor said that he hoped that the ban=
ks
and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut.

Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative

The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with=
=20
the
utilities that the legislature can support.  Although he admitted that he
couldn't prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative, the governor s=
aid
that in the end, the acid test with the public is how it affects their pock=
et
books.  Thus, if there is ultimately a ballot initiative, Governor Davis is
optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited
impact on electric rates.

Status of Defaulted Utility Debt

As we have commented in the past, it appears unlikely that the resulting
legislation will pass with the required 2/3majority to go into effect
immediately.  Accordingly, there will be a several month lag before the
utilities receive any cash.  In response to a question, it appears that the
state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaul=
ted
commercial paper.  But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation=
=20
will
provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing.
Essentially, it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to f=
ind
the money from their banks.

Governor's Strategy to Keep the Lights On

The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in Californi=
a
was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years.=
 =20
In
the intervening time, demand caught up with supply.  In response, he has
proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the
construction of new power plants.  He set a goal of having 20,000 megawatts
(mws) of new supply on line by 2004.

In addition, the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in=
=20
the
transmission infrastructure.  In particular, he cited the need to expand th=
e
capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability t=
o
move power from south to north within the state. He suggested that part of =
the
rationale for the state taking over the utilities' transmission grids was t=
o
ensure that the additional investment takes place.  He also suggested that =
the
state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow the=
m=20
to
continue to operate them.

In the meantime, the focus is to move away from California's over-reliance =
on
the spot market.  In that vein, Calpine (CPN: Ba1/BB+) yesterday announced =
the
signing of two long-term contracts with the state's Department of Water
Resources (DWR).  One of those contracts was to sell up to 1,000 mws over a=
=20
ten-
year term.  The other was to provide up to 495 mw of peaking capacity under=
 a
20-year contract.  Earlier in February, CPN had reached agreement with the =
DWR
on a separate 10-year contract for an additional 1,000 mws.

Energy Deal May Take a Month, Davis Tells Analysts=20

California members of Congress vow to keep seeking wholesale price caps.=20

By DAN MORAIN and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers=20

?????As a hopeful Gov. Gray Davis extended his East Coast barnstorming tour=
=20
before skeptical Wall Street utility analysts Wednesday,
 members of California's congressional delegation vowed to continue their=
=20
campaign for caps on wholesale electricity prices after a tense
 standoff with a top federal regulator.
?????Davis completed his five-day trip by raising about $200,000 for his 20=
02=20
reelection campaign at private events in Manhattan, and then
 conferring with analysts in an effort to persuade them that he is solving=
=20
California's energy crisis.
?????Although Davis delivered some good news--that some electricity supplie=
rs=20
would accept less than the full payments owed to them by the
 state's debt-ridden utilities--he acknowledged that it probably would take=
=20
more than a month to complete his plan to enable the utilities to stave
 off bankruptcy.
?????"Did they leave without doubt? I don't know that is ever the case,"=20
Davis said of his select audience of 35 analysts. "But I do believe they le=
ft=20
thinking I'm sincere, I'm making progress, and am confident that I will fix=

it."

?????Reaction Varies
?????Analysts who attended the hourlong meeting came away saying Davis=20
offered little that they didn't already know. Some questioned why he exclud=
ed=20
many analysts who closely track utility bond debt, given that Southern=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have defaulted
 on several bond payments.
?????Michael S. Worms, senior vice president of Gerard, Klauer & Mattison,=
=20
described Davis as "very cognizant of the situation," adding that the=20
governor appears to understand the fundamental problem that California lack=
s=20
sufficient power plants to supply the populace.
?????"I got the impression he is on top of it. He understands the issues,"=
=20
Worms said.
?????Others were far less charitable. Davis' lack of specificity added to=
=20
their skepticism.
?????"I'd like to see specifics," said Steven M. Fetter of Fitch Inc., whic=
h=20
rates companies' credit-worthiness. "I didn't expect specifics, and he live=
d=20
up to my expectations."
?????Davis told the analysts that some power generators have agreed to forg=
o=20
full payments from the utilities. State regulators have barred Edison
 and PG&E from passing on to consumers the skyrocketing wholesale power cos=
ts=20
charged by independent power generators and marketers, leaving the utilitie=
s=20
owing billions.
?????Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio confirmed Wednesday that two generators=
=20
made "unsolicited offers" to the governor to write off some of
 their debt. He did not identify the independent generators or say how much=

they would trim from their debt.
?????Representatives of the energy companies that have sold more than $1=20
billion in electricity to the state since January reacted coolly to Davis'=

suggestion that they not receive full payment for their goods.
?????"The best insurance against continued energy shortages is full payment=

for all deliveries that have been made in the past," said Gary Ackerman
 of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group of energy marketers and=20
generators.
?????Davis last week said he and Edison had agreed to the outlines of a dea=

by which the state would give the utility $2.76 billion in exchange for=20
its share of the statewide electricity transmission system.

?????However, on Wednesday, the governor said a final agreement between the=
=20
state and Edison will not be reached for as long as a month,=20
maybe longer. A deal with PG&E, the state's largest utility, "could take a=
=20
little longer," Davis said, adding that the company's debt is far larger
 than Edison's.
?????"This transaction is going to be scrutinized for decades to come," he=
=20
said. "I'm determined to do it fairly but do it in a way that withstands=20
scrutiny."
?????After conferring with Bush administration officials and attending a=20
governors conference in Washington, D.C., over the weekend, Davis=20
arrived in New York on Tuesday to be feted at a fund-raising dinner hosted =
by=20
Richard Medley, an economic strategy consultant and head of Medley Global=
=20
Advisors. On Wednesday, Davis attended a breakfast fund-raiser at the=20
headquarters of the banking and financial services firm Citigroup, whose=20
chairman, Sanford Weill, served as host.
?????The governor raised an estimated $200,000 in all for his 2002 reelecti=
on=20
campaign, a source said, requesting anonymity. Neither Medley
 nor Weill could be reached for comment. Both men are significant political=
=20
donors to national campaigns.
?????While Davis sought to make the case for his utility rescue plan, membe=
rs=20
of California's congressional delegation focused on efforts to reduce
 the high wholesale power costs at the heart of the crisis. The bipartisan=
=20
group of lawmakers pledged to press ahead with legislation that would impos=
e=20
temporary price caps, after they met behind closed doors with Curt Hebert=
=20
Jr., chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Hebert is a=20
free-market advocate and has vigorously opposed price controls.
?????"You heard me screaming?" asked Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego) after th=
e=20
meeting with Hebert.
?????"Almost everyone argued with Mr. Hebert that we need help from FERC,"=
=20
said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), citing Democratic
 and Republican support for temporary limits on wholesale prices. "Mr. Hebe=
rt=20
didn't care."
?????"It didn't make any difference whether you were a conservative=20
Republican or a liberal Democrat," Waxman said. "We all felt that we were
 not getting the help we need from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
."
?????But Waxman said he considered the meeting worthwhile "because it had t=
o=20
impress upon Mr. Hebert" the strong support for price controls shared by ma=
ny=20
California lawmakers.
?????Several Republicans who attended the session were less critical of the=
=20
agency and its chairman but expressed support for providing a=20
legislative fix in the absence of FERC intervention.
?????"The chairman is not going to be supportive of our bill, but he's at=
=20
least willing to talk with us and listen to us," said Rep. Duncan Hunter=20
(R-Alpine)
?????So far, only about half the delegation has endorsed the price cap=20
legislation. Filner noted that he and his ideological opposite, Hunter, hav=
e
 found common ground on this issue after hearing from constituents squeezed=
=20
by higher fuel costs.
?????During the meeting, Hebert declined--on his attorney's advice--to take=
 a=20
stand on Davis' proposal to have the state take control of the=20
electrical transmission system, according to some of those attending. The=
=20
takeover would require FERC approval, and Hebert reportedly=20
expressed concern about taking a position on a matter that his agency has n=
ot=20
yet considered.
?????Hebert bristled when a reporter, chasing him down a hallway, asked if=
=20
FERC were doing enough to help California.
?????"We've worked so hard on California that we have a backlog of 2,000=20
cases right now," he snapped, adding that Davis never asked to meet
 with him.
?????Asked if he was aware of talk that another chairman might be named, he=

Utilities executives say they pleaded with the PUC and Davis last summer to=

California Gov. Gray Davis yesterday suggested that power generators accept=

partial payment for the electricity they have supplied to the state's=20
financially troubled utilities.=20
Analysts at the meeting said the governor made reference to a company that=
=20
had agreed to do so. However, he did not identify the company or offer=20
details about how much it would accept.=20
Davis' comments at a closed meeting with analysts in New York City are=20
significant because they represent an apparent departure from the power=20
companies' position that they be repaid in full.=20
The move is in line with the governor's view that the generating companies=
=20
selling electricity to California 's utilities should contribute "modestly=
=20
and voluntarily" to solving the crisis.=20
Said Richard Cortwright, an analyst for Standard & Poors: "It came across=
=20
pretty loud and clear that he felt they could afford to take less than a=20
hundred cents on the dollar and still do pretty well for themselves."=20
Several power companies, including Enron Corp. and Reliant, both of Houston=

statements.=20
Davis went to Wall Street yesterday for the first time during the Californi=
a=20
power crisis to reassure the financial world's opinion- makers he is doing=
=20
all he can to resolve the problem.=20
During the meeting, Davis presented a history of how California 's=20
investor-owned utilities came to be in the sorry financial shape they are i=
n.=20
He was also said to have emphatically ruled out electricity rate increases,=
=20
saying they are politically unfeasible and would be easily undone by a vote=
r=20
initiative.=20
Davis also said he will have a deal within 30 days to purchase transmission=
=20
lines from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.=20
Financial analysts are looking forward to that deal as a way of providing t=
he=20
utilities with some cash to work their way out from under a combined debt=
=20
load estimated at $13 billion. The utilities have been barred by law from=
=20
passing high wholesale power costs on to customers.=20
At a press conference after the meeting, Davis told reporters that=20
negotiations are improving between the state and PG&E for a deal similar to=
=20
the one announced with Edison last week. In that transaction, the state wou=

buy Edison's power lines for $2.76 billion, and Edison would issue bonds to=

The move represents a potential breakthrough in the stalemated talks betwee=

utility's power lines for perhaps more than $7 billion.=20
Southern California Edison already has voiced willingness to part with its=

transmission lines. But sources familiar with the negotiations said PG&E ha=
s=20
remained largely inflexible, insisting that its lines are not for sale.=20
That stance could be changing.=20
According to an internal memo sent to some PG&E employees this week, the=20
utility is bringing in attorneys from an unspecified law firm to offer=20
guidance on a potential sale of assets.=20
"The company has hired a law firm to help deal with a possible purchase of=
=20
the electric transmission system by the state, as proposed by Gov. Davis as=

part of a deal to resolve the utility debt problem," the memo said.=20
It added: "Don't read anything into this regarding an agreement by PG&E to=

Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, refused to confirm the contents of the memo or=

even that such a memo was issued.=20
Choosing his words carefully, Low said: "We are not aware of the alleged=20

speaking on behalf of the public relations department.=20
Asked whether outside counsel had been retained, Low said, "It would be=20

Nevertheless, sources within the utility said the new lawyers are being giv=

workstations in PG&E's land department, where records of real estate holdin=

The sources interpreted this as a sign that the utility is eager to place a=

The situation in California is the result of continued regulation,=20
complicated by a series of natural and man-made factors.=20
In the past two years, California has enjoyed an economic boom fueled by a=

California has grown by 5,500 megawatts. Supply, on the other hand, has not=

California was clearly headed for major problems when nature pushed it over=

country, and you have an electricity supply problem in the West and an=20
electricity supply crisis in California .=20
The problem in California 's energy market is simple: There is too little=
=20
supply and too much demand. As a result, every potential solution must=20
address either or both of those factors, and the test for any proposal must=
=20
be: Does it increase supply? Does it decrease demand?=20
California desperately needs new generation. While Enron and other companie=
s=20
have built peaker generation facilities in as little as 10 months in other=
=20
states, it takes years to construct a power plant in California .=20
The state also suffers from a congested transmission system, which prevents=
=20
the delivery of power to where it is needed. California needs quicker sitin=
g=20
for power plants and expanded transmission facilities.=20
California also needs real-time pricing -- pricing that reflects the=20
difference in the cost of providing electricity at peak periods as compared=
=20
to non-peak periods.=20
As a country, we're power hungry. Virtually all of our daily amenities are=
=20
fueled by electricity. We flip switches and use electricity anytime we want=
,=20
with no thought to the cost at a given moment.=20
But if customers, particularly large commercial and industrial customers,=
=20
received real-time price signals, they'd know how much they were paying for=
=20
electricity at any given time. This would encourage conservation or shiftin=
g=20
usage to off-peak times to reduce electric bills.=20
This would also spread California 's scarce electricity supplies over more=
=20
users (including those residential customers who don't have the flexibility=
=20
to reduce or shift demand) and reduce the risk of rotating blackouts.=20
A complementary demand-side solution would be to purchase demand reductions=
.=20
If utilities or the state are willing to pay $75 for a megawatt hour, they=
=20
ought to be willing to pay $75 for a "negawatt" hour.=20
This would free up still additional megawatts to meet peak demand.=20
Blackouts are not voluntary, but by giving customers incentives to reduce=
=20
demand, the choice is theirs, and the result is less disruption to business=
=20
and the economy.=20
Customer choice is absolutely essential in creating a competitive market an=
d=20
in allowing consumers to realize the benefits of competition.=20
Just ask utility customers in San Diego, whose supplier purchased most of i=
ts=20
power on the spot market. When prices jumped, those hikes were passed along=
=20
to the consumer. The only customers who were protected were those who chose=
=20
alternative suppliers like Enron and had locked in a price, thus avoiding t=
he=20

California needs to rely less on the spot market. A balanced portfolio of=
=20
short- and long-term purchases by customers would sharply reduce=20
Californian's exposure to volatile prices and would bring down prices in th=
e=20
near term.=20
California needs to restore the creditworthiness of the utilities, which is=
=20
necessary to attract new generation and long-term supply commitments. The=
=20
state has made a significant first step by allowing the state Department of=
=20
Water Resources to purchase power on behalf of the utilities.=20
In a crisis, it is equally important to understand what won't work.=20
We cannot afford to waste time on things that don't work or make matters=20
worse. California does not need state control of the power business.=20
There is no reason to believe -- and every reason to doubt -- that governme=
nt=20
will do a better job than private firms in rapidly constructing new=20
facilities and operating them efficiently. In every other developed nation,=
=20
governments are getting out of the power business, not trying to get in it.=
=20
What California does not need is price caps, which don't work because they=
=20
neither increase supply nor decrease demand. In fact, they worsen the=20
situation. Price caps discourage investment in the development of new=20
generation.=20
When the state imposed price caps last October, companies such as Enron wer=
e=20
forced to cancel plans for more than 1,000 megawatts of peaking generation=
=20
that would have been online by this summer. Peaking plants are designed to=
=20
run fewer than 30 days a year -- only on days when supplies are tight. And =
if=20
price caps are in place, companies cannot recover their capital investment.=
=20
Price caps also discourage conservation and sales of power into the state=
=20
from power plants in other states.=20
If done right, deregulation means choice and competition. Deregulation mean=
s=20
lower prices. Deregulation means innovation. California has the opportunity=
=20
now to get it right.=20
