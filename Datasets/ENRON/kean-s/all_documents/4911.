Re:       Presidential Gala on May 22nd


I hope you and/or your colleagues will join us in the first major event 
honoring President and Mrs. Bush on May 22, 2001 in Washington, D.C.

Would you please consider buying a table for your office or tickets for 
individual colleagues?  The reception and dinner is a gathering of government 
officials from the White House, U.S. Senate, U.S. House as well as as 
Governors and other state and local government leaders.

Please use the attachments to
     -  Purchase a table or ticket(s), and
     -  Forward this e-mail to colleagues.
The deadline to respond is May 18th!

Please e-mail a reply back to me so that I do not bother you with follow-up 
emails or phone calls stating:
     -  The number of tickets or a table that you will be purchasing, or
     -  You already purchased your tickets or table, or
     -  You will not be participating in the May 22nd event.

For your use, I am attaching a (1) letter from the Co-Chairmen of the Gala, 
Jeff Marcus and Al Hoffman; (2) response form to fax or mail to the RNC; and 
(3) hyper-link to the Gala website to register online or join various 
membership groups of the RNC.

I look forward to hearing from you.
