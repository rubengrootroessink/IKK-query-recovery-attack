Meeting Details (Important =01&To Do=01,s=018 Please review red highlights.=
)

Portal.=20
Price-Waterhouse demonstrated Hewlitt Packard's benchmark portal.  Before=
=20
this portal, HP had 9000 webpages and some 300 competing channels.  They=20
consolidated their webpages down to 900.  Now they have one portal with a=
=20
host of seamless applications available through a single sign-on process. =
=20
Approximately 90% of employees use this tool.  The portal was unveiled in=
=20
October of 2000.  The $30 million project costs were realized by February,=
=20
2001.  In cost savings, HR alone has saved $10 million since October, 2000.=
 =20

HP sees their portal as an ever evolving tool.  They have planned phased=20
releases with new applications in new languages.  HP has a governance=20
committee operating to evaluate the current tool and plan for application=
=20
additions.  At the BU/FU level not all HP entities participate in the=20
governance committee.  Some elect to resolve these issues at the BU/FU=20
level. =20

PW's portal uses both Verity and Infoseek as their search engines.  The tas=
k=20
force will work with PW contacts at HP to learn about their experience with=
=20
both these tools. =20

According to HP the key to success for a portal project is change=20
management.  Communicate, communicate, communicate. =20

Brandon Rigney's team has completed work on the portal "Look and Feel".  Hi=
s=20
team is recommending the portal name:  anywhere.enron.com.  Brandon will be=
=20
presenting the "Look and Feel" to Allen Elliott's team Friday, 2/16/01=20
morning.  =20

A list of the applications prioritized for development was reviewed with th=
e=20
task force.  This list is a reflection of what was identified "in scope" in=
=20
the charter, what was collected from the portal surveys, and what killer=20
applications are being targeted.  Joe Wong will circulate the final approve=
d=20
list next week.

UDM/ESE.=20
Verity has been selected as the UDM/ESE tool of choice to pilot.  Sue Vasan=
=20
has been identified as the internal Business Analysts/Project Coordinator f=
or=20
the UDM/ESE pilot.  Sue, who works for Debbie Brackett in Rick Buy's=20
organization, will be working this pilot effort for the next three weeks=20
minimum.  Thank you to Debbie Brackett for identifying support. Debbie's=20
effort is testament to this teams intent to follow Steve Kean's advice to=
=20
deliver project objectives with minimal costs. =20

All task force members are to identify targeted audiences to test the UDM/E=
SE=20
tool.  Be prepared to provide your list of UDM/ESE pilot participants to Su=
e=20
Vasan at next week's task force meeting.  This list may be the original lis=
t=20
of employees you circulated the portal survey to.

All task force members are to identify a list of BU/FU applications to targ=
et=20
a UDM/ESE tool to search on (e.g. LiveLink, HR systems, etc.).  Be prepared=
=20
to provide this list at next week's task force meeting.=20

IM Strategy Proposal.
Per Steve Kean, the Task Force should continue focusing on delivering our=
=20
objectives with little expenses tagged to this project.  Task force members=
=20
are encouraged to provide resources and support for all task force=20
initiatives.

Allan Sommer is scheduled to deliver a draft of the IM Strategy Proposal. =
=20
Allan will deliver his pre-draft work to Marie end of week.
