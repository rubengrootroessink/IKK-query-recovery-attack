I have scheduled a meeting with Larry Adams, the Asst. U.S. Attorney, and 
Doug Kornreich, the Corps lawyer, for Wednesday at 10:30 AM.  Doug tells me 
that VEPCO has told him that it plans to file a challenge to the GAO's 
decision in the Court of Federal Claims this week.  I have also spoken to 
Andy Holloman;  we will call him from the Venable office for a "download" on 
the Colorado case.

Ideas on D.C. counsel?  V&E or Venable are the logical choices;  offhand I 
would propose V&E.
