Here is additional information and future work related to Monday's call.  

1. Top 20 List

The attached file is the final work plan for the initial analysis of Enron's 
Regulatory Risk.  Gia, John, and myself will be contacting the appropriate 
people to start this process.

I really appreciate everyone's help.  Call me if these assignments don't make 
any sense.




2. Risk Event Catalog

Amr Ibrahim continues to develop the event catalog.  Please feel free to call 
and work with him as much as you see fit.  I am hoping that we see a first 
cut within a few months.

3. Regulatory Origination

Edith Terry made a good point related to our role in helping identify 
positive regulatory and political changes (in the near-term) that can 
increase our business value.  Everyone should constantly be on the look-out 
for opportunties to further Enron's business interest.

4. Early Warning System

Robert Johnston is taking the lead on setting up a process / system to help 
us understand the overall "environment" within countries that we have 
business interests.  Anyone who wants to help should contact him.

Thanks again for all of the help.  

Jim Steffes
