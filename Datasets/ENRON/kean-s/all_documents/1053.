Subject: Schedule for the Schedules

The current schedule contemplates sending a draft of the Disclosure Schedules 
to Skadden by the end of the day on Friday.  Please provide any remaining 
comments to the draft Schedules as soon as you can.  I realize there will 
still be some holes, as we continue to negotiate the Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  No doubt it would help to have the Appendices to the Purchase and 
Sale Agreement completed, or say maybe a dollar amount or two completed in 
the Definitions section.  Thanks for all the help.  Lance.
