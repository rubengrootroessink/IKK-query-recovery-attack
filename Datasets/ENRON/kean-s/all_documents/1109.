Subject: EEI Conference Series on RTOs and Markets: Mark Your Calendars


EEI is pleased to announce a three-conference series addressing RTOs and 
electricity market design.

*  RTOs and Market Design:  How to Get Electricity Markets to Work.
September 28 and 29, Hilton Washington Embassy Row.
Current draft agenda attached.  This conference features a star-studded cast 
of speakers addressing market design issues from all around the country,  
Keynote by Commissioner William Massey.

*  RTOs:  The October Filings
November 2 and 3, Washington D.C. (hotel information to come).
Team leaders from each of the RTOs under development that must file in 
October will present their RTO plans.  EEI will have summaries of all of the 
major filings available.   This conference will give everyone a chance to be 
on the same page as to what the RTO filings propose and to learn what is 
being developed around the country.

*  RTOs:  The January Filings
February 8 and 9, Washington, D.C. (hotel information to come).
Team leaders from each of the approved ISOs that will file in January will 
present their RTO plans.  EEI will have summaries of all of the major filings 
available.  This conference will complete the initial tour of the RTO plans, 
nationwide.

These three conferences will give you the information you need to understand 
tomorrow's electric business and a chance to network with leaders in the  
industry.

Mastin, jmastin@eei.org.

We hope to see you there,
