1099 information is only produced if an account earns more than $10 in 
dividend/interest income.  Your savings for the year 2000 earned $3.96 and 
you have the free checking account which is non-interest bearing so there 
were no dividends earned on that account.  If you need additional 
information, please contact the Financial Services Department at the credit 
union at 713-853-6902.

Thank you.
