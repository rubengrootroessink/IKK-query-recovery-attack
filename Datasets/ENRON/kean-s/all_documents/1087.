CONFIDENTIAL WORK PRODUCT


The key points for the next 2 weeks are as follows:

1. Sen. Alpert Legislation on Rate Caps
 - 2290 may be "dead"
 - Senator staff recognizes the legislation has "problems"
 - Senator is still looking to move something with another vehicle
 - Enron MESSAGE:  "CPUC is fixing the problem, legislature should do 
nothing; if you decide to do     something, then use Enron's fixes" (which 
simply codify the CPUC's decision)
 -  focus on customers' support for our legislative fix rather than IEP
 - Jeff D. to talk with customers, give them our fix, tell them to sit tight, 
and contact Sandi M. to discuss
 - Sandi M. to talk with Sen. Alpert about our fixes

2. Continue to support Williamson Act fix for Pastoria
 - Committee meeting on 8/18 fo Urgency bill
 - no opposition identified to date (some question about Farm Bureau though)
 - Sandi M. to attend meeting to support bill

Sandi M. will report back on events tomorrow afternoon.

It looks like we can secure both items in a reasonable fashion.  We need to 
stay focused and coordinated.  If anyone has any questions, please let me 
know.
