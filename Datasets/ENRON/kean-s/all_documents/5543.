Joe -- could you see if someone at FERC -- Hebert or Madden, might be

Steve, we talked about the possibility of securing a speaker from FERC for 
the May 15 deregulation conference in Tokyo, either in person or by video 
conference. Have things settled down sufficiently to approach the person you 
had in mind?
