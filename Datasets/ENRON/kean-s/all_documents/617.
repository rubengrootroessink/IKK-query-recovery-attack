thanks for the summary - as this spill had high visibility through out Enron 
Corp (Jeff and Joe) - if from your review - you can say things have been 
handled properly as far as the clean up is concerned  - then it would be good 
to convey this message on up the ladder.  If we can't say things have been 
handled properly and clean up is satisfactory - then I would like your shop 
to dispatch a team on behalf of Enron - so that we can either reach that 
conclusion or determine where we have fallen short.

Please let me know -

thanks

Pete

Subject: Transredes Oil Remediation Efforts

Pete,

as you are aware, two weeks ago,  I surveyed the Oruru Lake and the 
Desaguadero River to the original source of the January oil leak with Henry  
Van and Tony  Henshaw.  I was pleased with what I observed both from the 
helicopter and on the ground.   We did not see visible oil rainbows, oil or 
oil stains either in the lake or  on the river bed, with the exception of a  
close up inspection of a limited area of water reeds that had been red 
flagged by the cleanup team. Even in that area  it was difficult to see any 
residual without it being pointed out by Tony Henshaw.  Tony explained that   
they were waiting for the property owners permission to initiate cleanup 
operations there.

We  observed from the air some of the plastic bagged cleanup materials staged 
on banks of the river bed.  Tony again explained that they were awaiting  the 
property owners permission to remove them  .  I was told that the bags have 
now been disposed at  the Sica-Sica landfill area . 

It was apparent that a diligent effort has been made to mitigate the oil 
spill.

Henry will follow up with a more detailed account.

Mike
