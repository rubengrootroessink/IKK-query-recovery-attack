Your work on the  Alberta PPA has not gone unnoticed and really is a  model 
for the rest of the group as to how to approach the review and analysis of  a 
significant transaction w/ huge reg. risk-  the thoroughness and quality of 
your work were top notch as was the teamwork you exhibited thoughout the 
process..... not to mention the external leadership you provided on the issue 
w/ folks like Larry Charach. Thanks very much!
