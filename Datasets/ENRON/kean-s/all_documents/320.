Kelly:

Thanks for the quick turn-around.

The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India 
by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!!  Many people, including Rob B. have seen 
these positions.  Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a 
position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not 
argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting 
involved, as a company, in scientific arguments).

The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial 
ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what 
Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is 
a pure business decision.  This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the 
Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me.

Please see the attached.  As you know, Ken was in Davos.  Look at this 
summary that came directly off of the Davos web site -- climate change was 
seen by business leader at Davos as the greatest challenge during the next 
century.  Our middle-of-the-road position was the mainstream Davos CEO 
position!

Good show!  My initial thought, however is that we need to vet this position 
internally, namely with senior management, and get them to agree that this is 
our position.  As you will recall, Ken got very different views on the issue 
from different people as we prepared for Davos and we need to run it up the 
flagpole.  I think it is clearly a time for a more defined position, and it 
should help us with the environmental community.

What do you think?  Maybe I am off base and we are all in agreement, but when 
I hear from our friend Rob Bradley it does not seem that way!

On Tuesday, I met with Steve Kean to discuss a variety of greenhouse gas 
policy issues.  
Among these matters was my request to more formally  articulate Enron's 
greenhouse gas policies.

I get frequent calls for information on our climate change policy and have 
never sent out any paper on our views.

Attached are some questions and answers I have used, and many many other 
Enron staff have used to articulate our policies.  They were originally 
drafted to support a meeting Ken Lay had with the President 2 years ago and 
have been periodically updated.

I want to take these thoughts and simply put them into a brochure format.  
Simple, quick, cheap!

Steve Kean said to co-ordinate with the two of you.  That is what I am now 
doing.  Any thoughts?  Please get back to me soon.

CHEERS!

John P.
