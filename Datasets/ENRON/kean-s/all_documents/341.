Interesting timing for your question.  My take, after discussions with Terry, 
was that she was brought on to handle the environmental side of sustainable 
development, but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related 
issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet.  Burt Mike and I 
learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisano--he is the one who 
took her from consultant to employee status.  I spoke with John on Friday and 
told him that I wasn't going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in 
the scheme of things.  

This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway.  As you know, I need a more 
senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and 
I didn't want her to feel slighted when I found someone.  Moreover, she has 
just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and 
wants to telecommute.  This should work fine for John but I feel it is 
important for my person to be in DC or NY.

Is Catherine working on environmental policy related to sustainability or is 
she working on greenhouse gas transactions . . . or both?

You do not need to real Catherine McKalip-Thompson's full trip report from 
her European venture, but you did express some surprise that on her trip to 
Europe she went beyond policy and discussed "busienss" or commercial 
activities, as I recall our conversation.  her note below makes clear, to me, 
that partnerships and investments were discussed with, inter alia, a Dutch 
distribution company, Credit Lyonnais, and CGU (an insurer).  Just FYI.   mcs

John,

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today.  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the "gap financing" fund.UNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.

Catherine
