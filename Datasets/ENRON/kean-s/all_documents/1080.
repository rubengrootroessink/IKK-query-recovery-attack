   The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego <B>electricity</B> bills is
a
poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under
the rubric of fostering the public good.  In this case, California's
seven-year <B>electric</B> industry <B>deregulation</B> effort, with
complete
support and crafting from the Democratic-controlled state
Legislature, is being made the whipping boy for the current price
spikes.



  The truth is anything but.  Nevertheless, facts have never stopped
elected officials, politically appointed regulators or consumer
advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen
by consumers as their patron saint.

   In the debate over this summer's high power bills it is the very
folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to
the "crisis."  Among the culprits -- Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon,
the Legislature, Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood, and
San Diego Gas&Electric Co. -- each has contributed to the bills
going through the roof.
   But having said that, it never has been, nor does it need to be, a
crisis for the state or for San Diego County.  California will
survive the current electrical bumps and grinds, but it may not
survive the political fallout.
   It is now clear that two Gov. Gray Davis appointees -- Wood and
CPUC President Loretta Lynch -- want to re-regulate the electric
industry as does Sen. Peace.  SDG&E unfortunately was dumb enough to
help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the
issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion.
   Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a "radical"
deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness
has created a "crisis."
   The cornerstone of the problem, as Wood sees it, is that there
haven't been any major power plants built in the state in more than a
decade. (It is also true that when California's electric
restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago, there was an
over-supply of generation capacity within the state.) Wood wants to
turn that around by mandating utility-built power plants.
   Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation
plants are under construction or in the state's lethargic approval
process right now.  If, magically, they could all be built by next
summer, California would be awash in electrons.  They can't, but
there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of
2003, if the state -- Gov. Davis, most specifically -- does something
to accelerate the current siting approval process.  Earlier this
month, the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting
process.
   Regulatory intervention (some call it re-regulation) is what Peace
has had on his mind at least since winter when, at an energy
discussion held in San Diego, he sounded the drumbeat for the
government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the
market.  At the same time, he and his colleagues in the Legislature
for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the
deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity.
   Most notably, Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this year's
budget bill that prevented the state's utilities from buying some of
their power supplies outside the state-created power exchange.  That
move, and SDG&E's passive financial management, helped eliminate one
means of lessening the current electric bill shock.
   There are further design flaws in California's restructured
electricity market -- initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from
having the highest priced power in the state -- that have complicated
the newly developing market, and for which politicians take no
responsibility.
   Finally, there is SDG&E, which clings to its own self-proclaimed
fiction that it is only an "energy delivery service" and holds no
responsibility for what has happened to the 1.2 million households
and businesses using the juice it delivers.
   In fact, however, the utility company could have taken some steps
in the spring in terms of financial risk-management instruments
offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered
the price spike.  It also could have been more aggressive in
promoting conservation by customers.
   Subsequently, SDG&E has been tripping all over itself making
emergency filings to the CPUC, seeking authorizations it could have
aggressively pursued before the crisis.  The regulators granted
everything it asked for, finally, on Aug. 3.
   But SDG&E does have a generating role -- it still has a 20 percent
interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate
operates a new power plant in Nevada.
   And, guess where that plant sold all of its power during the
recent crunch in California?  To Arizona -- that's where!
