Joe --

The Kennedy School has an on-line resume search device.  I put in "MITI and 
energy" and this resume popped up.

Let me know.

Jim,

Good to see you last week.  As we begin to look for Japanese employees and in 
particular, RA/GA resources it would seem to make sense to tap into the US 
Graduate Schools (eg Kennedy School, W Wilson School, etc).  It would be a 
real coup if we could find an ex MITI employee for example that was educated 
in the States and had a taste for something "exotic."  It won't necessarily 
be easy.  At HBS we had two Japanese in our section that decided not to go 
back to their sponsoring company.  Today one is working for BCG and the other 
Cargill.

Any thoughts, contacts, etc.

Joe
