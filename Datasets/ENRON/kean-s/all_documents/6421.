Hi Everybody!
?
Over the holidays, I installed the CD-ROM for  Mom and Dad's second free year 
of Dellnet service.? Because Dellnet is  combining with MSN, Mom and Dad's 
email address had to be changed.? It is  now rex04@msn.com . Their old 
address still  works and probably will continue to work until the end of 
January, so if you  sent something to them recently using the old address, 
they should still get  it.? From now on, though, it would probably be best to 
use the new address  so Mom doesn't have to retrieve email for both addresses.
?
Thanks,
?
