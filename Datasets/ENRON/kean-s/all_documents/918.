I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever.  Having duties related to 
setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on 
the Hill, will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those 
duties, not just those related specifically to her substantive area.  I think 
it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting, 
rather than directing, others in the organization.
