Max,

Attached you will find a copy of the briefing document that Steve Kean and 
Rick Shapiro asked me to prepare for Mr. Lay.  As you requested, I have kept 
the information on commercial issues to projects which have been closed.

As you will see, the document is focused on policy and regulation.  I am 
concerned about Mr. Lay having enough information on energy imports since it 
is one of the points that the Secretary may touch upon.  If you consider it 
appropriate, maybe you could inform Mr. Lay on this matter.

I sincerely regret that you feel that there is a misalignment of commercial 
and regulatory interests.  Hopefully when deregulation happens and business 
grows the perception of this misalignment will disappear.  

I agree with you that communication has not been optimal in the last months.  
As you have been concentrated on the Vitro deal, I myself was very involved 
with the transition team.  I will be flying to Monterrey once a week to see 
you so that we can share information on our meetings with different 
government authorities as well as the commercial information that you think 
is relevant for me.

Best,  


Ricardo
