I sent this to Rick Shapiro and Mark Palmer as well.  This is an ad created 
for use in the Ontario market and would include the logos of the signatory 
companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck Dadson worked with GPC on 
its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which includes Ken Lay's visit 
to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government leaders.

Give me your thoughts.

Eric
