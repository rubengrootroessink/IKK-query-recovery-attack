I think I confirmed for this already, but could you check and put on my 
calendar and put this in the meeting file.

Steve, I spoke with Ginger about your availability to deliver a keynote 
address at a Maguire Energy Institute conference on "Electricity Deregulation 
Report Card" on November 1.  Jeff is on this board, and they asked us if we 
could enlist Ken Lay to deliver this keynote.  Ken is scheduled to be at a 
board meeting in Washington this date, so is not available.   I suggested 
that you may be a suitable replacement, and they are very interested in the 
prospect of your participation.

The link below is to the website for this conference, and the keynote would 
be delivered from 1:00p-1:30p, immediately following the luncheon.  Please 
let me know if you are available and willing to deliver this keynote; I would 
appreciate a response today if possible.

Thanks, SRS
