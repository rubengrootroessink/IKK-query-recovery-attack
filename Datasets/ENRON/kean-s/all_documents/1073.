Subject: Gooooooooooood Bye!

I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that I'm outta here!

Today is my last day in the office here at Azurix, and in the coming months, 
I will start in a new position as SVP in the LNG development group at El Paso 
Energy.  This happened very quickly, and I wanted to make sure that I let 
everyone know before I left.

I don't have any contact information yet for my new job, but if you want to 
reach me, you can do so at RobBrnglsn@aol.com or at 713-664-7478.

I enjoyed working with all of you during the past five years at Enron / 
Azurix, and I wish you all of the best.

Take care.

Rob Bryngelson

PS -- There is a happy hour tonight at Scudeiros on Dallas Street (just west 
of the Met Garage) beginning around 5:00.  If you can make it, please come!
