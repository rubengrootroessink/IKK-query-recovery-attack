It has been decided to again expand the MD PRC committee beyond the Policy 
committee members to include other MDs.  Each of you has been chosen to 
participate in the mid-year MD PRC to take place on Tuesday, July 24.  David 
Oxley and his team will provide you with pertinent details of the meeting.  
Please let Jeff Skilling know if you have a conflict or any concerns 
regarding your participation in this process.  SRS
