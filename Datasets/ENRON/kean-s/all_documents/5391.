Steve, 
Thanks for the meeting today, if you would like me to sit down and go through 
some of the issues and risks associated with the IT elements of the project, 
we can meet and have a more focused discussion. It is always difficult to 
talk through all of the area's when both Philippe and Bill are together. 

Martin
