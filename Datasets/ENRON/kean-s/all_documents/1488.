Rosie, 

On September 25, 2000 the Tibetan Government-in-exile wrote Dr. Lay at the 
Beijing office address requesting that Enron cancel its participation in the 
Sebei-Lanzhou pipeline.   We faxed a copy of this communication to you a few 
minutes ago.  We have drafted the attached proposed response.  Rebecca 
McDonald concurs with the approach in this letter, which has been reviewed by 
the addressees of this message.  Your assistance in appropriately formatting 
and printing the letter for signature would be appreciated.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions or need assistance.

Thanks,

John
