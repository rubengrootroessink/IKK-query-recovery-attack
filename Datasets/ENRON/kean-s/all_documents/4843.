Thanks.  Yes, I did know about the conference.  Ken has a copy of the study 
and made reference to it several times during our visits to Sac. a couple of 
weeks ago.  It's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in 
California.  
I look forward to catching up with you when I get back to town.

Hope you are keeping your head above water.  I wanted to let you know about
this request.  As you know, we did work for the Bay Area Council.  I don't
know if you will be joining Ken on this, but I did send you a copy of the
report a couple of weeks ago.  I did not send one to Ken, but will.  Let me
know if you need any additional copies.

Lenny, Tony and Paul,

We have been contacted by Janet Yamane of Marathon Communications inviting
the Bay Area Council to sponsor a meeting with Bay Area  CEOs and Kenneth
Lay, Chairman of Enron, who will be visiting California this week to
discuss
energy and on.  She offered 5/17 am but added that if that wasn't available
that another time could be scheduled further on.  Sunne wanted your opinion
on this request.

Fred Furlong, Federal Reserve Bank is not available 5/17 am.  So that date
really won't work.  Please advise.

Alana
