There is also a california update call (used to be daily, now weekly).  
Marcia Linton (Jim Steffes' assistant) can give you the call in information 
and add you to the distribution list.

Steve,
I just added Shirley this morning, and I am forwarding her the articles that 
I distributed earlier today.

You mentioned at the end of our conf call last week that there might be an 
internal distribution I should be on.  Is there someone I should contact to 
get on the list?
