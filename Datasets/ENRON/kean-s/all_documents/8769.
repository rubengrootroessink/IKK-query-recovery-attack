I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to 
go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for 
example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone.

Wanted you to be aware that Mayor Brown is inviting Jeff to meet with him, 
either in San Francisco or elsewhere.  Please advise, but I know that Jeff 
would probably not travel to California.

Mark Koenig and Andy Fastow will discuss meeting with Mayor Brown on the 
CalPERS issue.

Thanks,
Joannie

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City & County of San Francisco
