Kevin, Steve, and Shashi--Per your request,  attached is a memo that 
addresses regulatory issues with Enron's potential minority investment in a 
software company providing tagging or scheduling software to the electric 
transmission industry.  Aside from possible routine reporting requirements 
and possible additional standards of conduct precluding the sharing of 
information with the traders, there are no issues pertaining to PUHCA  and 
the Fed. Power Act.  Christi 37007
