P.S.  Obviously, Jane's answer also forecloses pursuing the question from 
Skadden regarding second-tier and other ownership entitites.  I have, 
however, put to Jane the question about our 5% holding in GAIL.   mcs

Just from what I know (I don't think more questions would maintain 
confidentiality) there is a central Foreign Investment Board that would 
probably have to approve if anything is sold to a foreigner.

I understand that there is no limitation on asset sale, via financing 
doucments, except approval of lenders, but is there any state/central 
approval, e.g., India Investment Board?  thanks  mcs
