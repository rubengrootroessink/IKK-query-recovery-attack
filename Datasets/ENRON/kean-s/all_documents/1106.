In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is 
the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at 
Enron.  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few 
who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is 
committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).  
This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about 
cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging -- 
software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML 
format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face 
two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) 
and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization

Subject: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative

As agreed in our V&V meeting today I have attached two items for your review:
1. A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus 
group on this subject.

The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 
5-7 key scenarios that will be a part of the training.  Please let me know if 
you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your 
unit's unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account.  If so, let 
us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified.

Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter 
Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are 
further developed.

2. A list of the "first draft" objectives for the program and 10 possible 
scenarios.

Since we will only be able to have a total of about 5-7 scenarios in the 
final version, identify the 5 - 7 on this list of high level scenario ideas 
that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most 
applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization.  Any 
other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be 
greatly appreciated.

We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the 
beginning of next week.  Therefore, if you could provide your feedback on 
both of the items above by Friday, August 18th, it would be greatly 
appreciated.
