Adam Wenner prepared the attached chart laying out the various mitigation 
options.  As you can see from the chart, some of the mitigation measures are 
much more complicated than others.  FERC appears to have concerns with the 
more complicated mitigation measures, but the more complicated measures also 
cost little or nothing to implement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah -- attached is the chart of current and proposed mitigation measures.
I think it would be useful to distribute this prior to our call on Monday,
so that the group could be thinking along those lines sooner rather than
later.
