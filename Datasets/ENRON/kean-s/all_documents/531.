Hi Steve,

I am not aware of any transactions such as stock option exercises, etc. which 
have to be reported by May 10.

Thanks for focusing on this matter each month.

Elaine

do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related 
to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of 
the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution.  
We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a 
filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail?
