We need to be careful how we position this.  I'm concerned that this may be 
perceived as Enron re-entering the residential market -- even though we're 
proposing to supply SDG&E rather than direct end-use customers.  How does 
this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received?

Subject: SDG&E Offer

Attached is a write-up of a presentation on making a "public" offer in 
SDG&E's territory for supplying their residential load.

If we are to do this, we need to probably have something ready by late August.

Any comments?

Just in case you need this for future reference.  I played with it and gave 
it a simple look.  (You can always delete if you don't like it.)
