Ladies and Gentlemen:

Set forth below for your information and review are the expenditures with 
Minority/Women Owned Business Enterprises through June 30, 2000.

As you can see, Enron's spend through mid-year 2000 is below the trend 
necessary to achieve the targeted 15% that was committed for the year.  In an 
effort to assist you in achieving your unit's objectives, Calvin Eakins and I 
will schedule business reviews over the next two weeks to share strategies 
for increasing opportunities for M/WBE's to provide goods and services to 
Enron.

Thanks in advance for making time available on your schedule,

George Wasaff
