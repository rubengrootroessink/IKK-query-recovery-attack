Forward to whomever you see fit. It looks like an opportunity to explain 
price risk management to large customers.

Hello Mr. Kean,

In follow up to an earlier phone message I left, I am sending you the
preliminary agenda for my upcoming conference in Atlanta.  If you are not
the right person for this topic, I would appreciate suggestions for other
speakers at Enron.

Thank you!
Valerie Anderson
