Subject: trip to Houston

I expect to be in Houston next Monday from 1300, until Tuesday around 1500.  
If any of you wish to meet, please have Maureen work with Beverley toput 
something in the diary.

Elizabeth - if you do not mind, I think if we just sit down for a few hours, 
this will be the best way to assure that Iget you timely and accurate budget 
info, so can we book something?   thanks  mcs
