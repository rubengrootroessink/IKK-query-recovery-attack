Attached is the information on talent moves within Enron.  The numbers are 
for Enron's domestic workforce only.  The bottom line is that the EBS and EES 
redeployment figures are not unusual for Enron:  We moved over 3000 employees 
last year (about 25% of our domestic workforce).  Most of these moves are 
attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of 
business transfers within the company.  The formal redeployment process makes 
up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company.
