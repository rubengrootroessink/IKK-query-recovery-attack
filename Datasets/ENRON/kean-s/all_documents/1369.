		 Subject: PO Approval needed

Elizabeth,

Because of the dollar amount of this PO, I need to have an email approval 
from your senior director.  Could you forward this to the appropriate party 
(if it's not you) and have him/her email me back with a note saying 
"approved" on it?  I will fax this immediately after I receive that.  Thank 
you!!
