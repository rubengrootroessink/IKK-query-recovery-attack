Enron's Lay on Speculation on Cabinet Post: Comment (Correct)
12/13/0 14:49 (New York)


     (Corrects spelling of Cheney in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Following are comments from
Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay on
speculation he may be appointed to George W. Bush's Cabinet. Enron
said today Jeffrey Skilling, the company's president and chief
operating officer, will take over from Lay as chief executive in
February. Lay said he will remain chairman.

On going to Washington:

     ``It's flattering to be rumored about. That's all those are
are rumors. I plan to stay at Enron. I plan to stay in Houston.''

     He said the appointment of his successor coincidently
occurred at around the same time the U.S. Supreme Court issued the
ruling that likely will pave the way for a Bush administration.

     ``I'm a strong supporter of President-elect Bush and Vice
President-elect Cheney, and I hope that we can start to call them
that. They are both good friends, and I have been a very strong
supporter for a very long time. I hope to continue to support them
as much as I can -- from Houston.''

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update5)

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update5)

     (Adds Rebecca Mark's departure from Enron in ninth to 10th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. named as chief
executive officer its President Jeffrey Skilling, who helped make
the Houston-based natural-gas pipeline company into the largest
competitor in the growing energy-trading business.
     Skilling, 47, succeeds Ken Lay as chief executive. Lay, 58,
said he will remain as chairman, a position he has held since
February 1986, and has no plans to serve in the presidential
administration of Texas Governor George W. Bush, as some news
reports suggested.
     Enron's revenue will more than double this year, possibly
topping $90 billion, largely because of Lay's and Skilling's
efforts to exploit deregulation of U.S. natural gas and power
markets, analysts and investors say. Enron has focused on
arranging sales and purchases of energy for large buyers such as
utilities and corporations.
     ``I'm glad to see that Ken Lay had the presence of mind to
allow Jeff, who's really been running the show for a couple of
years anyway, to go ahead and take over,'' said Donato Eassey, a
Merrill Lynch analyst. ``Jeff has worked hard to position this
company to be an energy exploiter in an era of new technology.''
     Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey & Co.'s
energy and chemical consulting practices. He became Enron's
president and chief operating officer in 1996. He will keep those
posts after becoming chief executive.

                            Stock Soars

     Enron shares fell $1.69 to $75.50 in midafternoon trading.
The stock has doubled in the last 12 months as Enron's energy
trading strategies continued to pay off. The company's earnings
have risen by more than 30 percent in each of the last four
quarters.
     ``The best time for the succession to occur is when the
company is doing well,'' said Lay, who said revenue could top $90
billion this year, up from about $40 billion in 1999. ``Enron is
doing extremely well now.''
     Skilling's biggest competitor for the CEO's spot was Rebecca
Mark, who helped Enron expand outside the U.S. and led the
company's efforts to build a global water company.
     In August, Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.
business, resigned from Enron's board and quit as chairman and
chief executive of Azurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron
two years ago. Azurix's performance never matched expectations,
and its share price plunged, preventing the company from using its
stock for acquisitions as the company had originally planned.
     Mark and another high-ranking Enron executive, Vice Chairman
Joseph Sutton, focused on buying or building large projects such
as power plants while Skilling moved the company to focus on
trading, a business that requires far fewer assets. Sutton
resigned in October as Skilling's strategy won out.

                            Big Profits

     Record-high natural gas prices and Enron's move to switch its
electricity, gas, oil and commodities trading business onto the
Internet have helped boost earnings and revenue.
     In November 1999, the company opened EnronOnline, an Internet
site where buyers and sellers of commodities can conduct business
with Enron. The site handled $280 billion in transactions in its
first year, and now manages $2.4 billion in trades each day. Enron
sells everything from paper pulp to space on fiber-optic
telecommunications networks on the site.
     Skilling ``has been driving the evolution of this company
from an asset-based pipeline company to something no other company
in the world is,'' said David Fleischer, a managing director of
Goldman, Sachs & Co., which has put Enron on its list of top 30
stocks. ``It's a company that is now growing on its intellectual
capital and providing products and services to energy companies.''

Venezuela's PDVSA Plans $600 Mln Natural Gas Plant (Update1)

Venezuela's PDVSA Plans $600 Mln Natural Gas Plant (Update1)

     (Updates from seventh paragraph.)

     Caracas, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- State oil company Petroleos
de Venezuela SA said it plans to build a $600 million natural gas
complex in the western part of the country, replacing several
outdated facilities.
     Construction of the plant, which would produce liquid natural
gas, is expected to start in mid-2001, with production slated for
2004, said PDVSA officials. The plant would be located in the
western state of Zulia.
     ``We haven't decided whether to finance the project alone or
through a joint venture,'' said Nelson Nava, director of
development for PDVSA Gas, the company's natural gas unit. ``We
will work out the program during the first quarter of 2001.''
     PDVSA is betting that natural gas prices will remain high,
ensuring a ready market for liquid natural gas and ethane. PDVSA,
whose sole shareholder is the government, is planning to build a
similar plant in the eastern part of the country as well.
     ``We've already started engineering work on the project,''
said PDVSA Vice President Domingo Marsicobetre.
     Venezuela, with about 147 trillion cubic feet in reserves, is
counting on private companies to help develop its reserves and
boost natural gas exports.
     Meanwhile, talks are continuing with Enron Corp. about a
proposed $556 million natural gas liquefaction plant to be built
in eastern Venezuela, said Nava.
     Under the existing proposal, PDVSA could take up to 25
percent stake in the plant. Negotiations between the two sides
have been continuing for about a year.
     ``We're still in talks with Enron,'' but delays have arisen
due to the government's tardiness in coming up with a pricing
policy for natural gas exports, said Nava.
     An agreement is now expected in the first quarter, he said.
     The plant would produce 2 million metric tons a year of
liquefied natural gas by 2004. The plant, planned for Jose in the
eastern state of Anzoategui, is slated to export LNG to the U.S.
     Venezuela hopes to triple natural gas production and double
proven reserves, already the world's seventh largest, in the
coming years as demand for the commodity surges.

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update3)

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update3)

     (Updates share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, named President and Chief Operating Officer
Jeffrey Skilling as chief executive, succeeding Kenneth Lay, who
will remain chairman.
     Lay, 58, has been chairman and CEO since February 1986. The
management changes will be effective Feb. 12.
     Lay backed Texas Governor George W. Bush's campaign for
president, and was mentioned in the Houston Chronicle and in other
news media as a possible appointee to Bush's Cabinet. Lay and
Skilling both said today that Lay won't be joining the new
administration.
    ``I am particularly happy that Ken and I will continue running
the company together, and that he has put the rumors of his
possible departure to Washington, D.C., to rest,'' Skilling said.
     Enron's stock has doubled in the last 12 months as Lay and
Skilling's energy trading strategies continued to pay off. The
company, which had 1999 revenue of $40 billion, could top $90
billion this year, Lay said.
     ``The best time for the succession to occur is when the
company is doing well,'' Lay said in an interview. ``Enron is
doing extremely well now.''
     The company's revenue has surged, in part because of record-
high natural gas prices and Enron's moving its electricity, gas,
oil and commodities trading business onto the Internet.
     In November of last year, the company opened EnronOnline, an
Internet site where buyers and sellers of commodities can conduct
business with Enron.
     The site handled $280 billion in transactions in its first
year, and now manages $2.4 billion in trades each day. Enron sells
everything from paper pulp to space on fiber-optic
telecommunications networks on the site.
     Lay transformed Houston-based Enron, once just a gas pipeline
company, into an international power-plant and energy-project
developer, and the leader in the growing business of arranging
sales of electricity and other types of energy between large
consumers.
     Skilling, 47, joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey &
Co.'s energy and chemical consulting practices. He became Enron's
president and chief operating officer in 1996.
     Shares of Enron fell 81 cents to $76.38 in late morning
trading.
