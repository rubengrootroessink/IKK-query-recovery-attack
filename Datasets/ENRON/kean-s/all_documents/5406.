Steve,

Jeff is talking at SMU Management Briefing Series on March 27th.  The 
organizers wanted him to talk about his background and career at Enron and 
about where the industry is heading.  The presentation covers this last 
piece.  The audience will be local business people and some SMU students and 
professors (350-400 people)

Jeff already reviewed this presentation.  Please, let me know if you have any 
questions or suggestions.

Thanks,

Ursula Brenner
