Steve,

When filling out the feedback form I misread you as my supervisor and I 
filled out the form referring to you.  I said pretty good things about you,  
you should not, repeat SHOULD NOT believe what I said.  I was just trying to 
help you out with your supervisor.

Regarding  Rick.  I can tell you that I respect him very much.  He has shown 
signs of friendship beyond of what I expected.  You know that I was not very 
happy with my past review but I never doubted that Rick did the best he could 
given the information that he had.  I never doubted his integrity or 
qualifications.

Rick is an outstanding leader and manager.  He has the ability of managing a 
large and diverse group of people effectively and with no one ever feeling 
any pressure, arrogance, etc.

Steve,  you have a great team which I have already started to miss.

Best,

Ricardo
