Here's the Opinion Elite file.  It looks very strong for our open access 
argument.

Suggest we update the WH.  Any other uses?  I have the verbatims and cross 
tabs.  We'll send a sanitized version (although there's not much I wouldn't 
want everybody to see) to some of the interviewees who requested it.
