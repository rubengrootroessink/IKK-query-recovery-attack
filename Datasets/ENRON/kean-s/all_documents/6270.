Dear Advisory Committee Member:

Thank you again for agreeing to serve on the Department of Commerce

responding to the attached questions about the Department of Commerce.
Please feel free to address any additional issues that are not covered in
the questions.

Please send your response (as well as any other policy-related messages) to
me at:  paul.scolese@bushcheney.gov.  I have attached the questions as text
and as a Word format document.

The membership list is currently being finalized.  I will send you a

       Discussion Question for Transition Advisory Committee Members
                          Department of Commerce


     The Department of Commerce considers broad range of issues in its role
as   the   lead   Department   in  promoting  trade,  economic  growth  and
technological  advancement.  These issues include:  Science and Technology,
Telecommunications,  International  Trade,  Export  Promotion,  Patent  and
Trademarks,   Economic   Development,   Competitiveness,  and  Oceanic  and
Atmospheric  Research.   With  this  information  in  mind, we ask that you
consider the following questions.


1.    Are  there  any critical issues handled by the Department of Commerce
that  you  believe might rise to the Presidential level for decision in the
first year of the new Administration?

2.   If a short list of issues facing the Department of Commerce were being
developed, what issues do you believe should be on that list?

3.    Are there any policy areas that have been neglected at the Department
of Commerce over the past eight years that need to be addressed?

4.    Are  there any management, administrative or organization issues that
need to be addressed?

5.    Are  there  any  significant  administrative  actions (organizational
changes,  executive  orders,  directives,  program letters, rulemakings, or
lawsuits) that should be reviewed early in the new Administration?

6.    Please  provide  any  other  information  on policy or administrative
issues you believe would be helpful.
