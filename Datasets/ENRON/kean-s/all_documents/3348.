Good article.  These consultants / academics work for the group we are 
talking to about writing a "what if no deregulation" piece for Enron and 
hopefully others.

Jim:
Sounds like something we would have written.  Teece is the Chairman of LECG 
with whom I met yesterday.  Spiller and Schmuel are two UC Berkeley 
professors who are principals at LECG.  I don't know when they wrote this or 
if they're trying to get it placed.  Teece forwarded it to me today.
Best,
Jeff
