Steve - 

Just wanted to let you know things are progressing nicely on the Houston 
Video.  Mark Palmer's group have given me support on the video copy and Beth 
Stier has stayed in contact with the video company to ensure quality for us.

I will set up some time to go over the mock up with you later this week.

Hope all is well with you.  

Traci

Good morning. I have worked up a "mock" for the  main menu for the Houston 
Project we are working on. This will come onto the  screen after the video, 
you will us it to navigate to your custom page.  
 
If you could please take a look at the mock at this
