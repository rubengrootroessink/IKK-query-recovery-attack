Subject: Short Biography for Highlands Forum XVII Meeting

Dear Mr. Kean:

My team is pulling together the briefing books for our upcoming Highlands
Forum meeting in Carmel Valley.  These books include a list of short
biographies.  Your biography, provided to me by Dick O'Neill, currently
reads as follows:

"Mr. Steven J. Kean is Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff for Enron
Corporation.  Mr. Kean's responsibilities include government affairs, public
relations, corporate communications, advertising, and administration.  Mr.
Kean also serves on the Executive Committee of Enron.  Mr. Kean has a B.A.
from Iowa State University and a J.D. from the University of Iowa."

I wanted to provide you with the opportunity to send a slightly longer
biography, if you so desire.  The general length of our biographies is
usually roughly 15-20 lines.  If I do not hear from you, I will assume that
the above entry is fine.

We look forward to seeing you in Carmel Valley!

Warm regards,
MichSle Ledgerwood
