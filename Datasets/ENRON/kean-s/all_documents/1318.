The PAC did not give the money.  PAC contributions to federal candidates are 
limited.  The money was a combination of individual contributions Ken 
solicited and soft money donations to the Republican Party.

I think I understand why people get confused now.  See below, in blue.....  I 
know you mean the Enron PAC has contributed more than $615k to the Bush 
campaign (right?), but it reads like Enron Corp gave money directly to Bush.  
It's a complicated issue -- which I am hoping to simplify with my story!  I'm 
going to use the second quote below in the article.

On Workplace Sleeves, Few Political Hearts

An example is Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate, which even suggests how 
much employees should give.
Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his 
stationery asking them to contribute
$1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice 
president. This year, Enron and its
employees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said. 

But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ''We might tell employees 
to go out and vote, but nobody tells
them who to vote for or passes out brochures,'' Mr. Kean said. ''That kind of 
thing is just not acceptable in today's
workplace.''
