Steve,

I plan to send the below email to the KM Sponsors (Rick Buy, Rick Causey, 
Philippe Bibi, Cindy Olson, and George Wasaff) and KM Task Force members 
(Melissa Becker, Debbie Brackett, Anthony Mends, Pegi Newhouse, Bryan Powell, 
and Andrea Yowman).  Please let me know if you have any  recommendations.  I 
scheduled a meeting with you for tomorrow morning (11/28) at 8:30 to review 
the project.  In addition, I placed hard copies of the attachments on your 
chair.  

Thanks,
Marie Hejka
