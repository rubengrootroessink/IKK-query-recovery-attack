Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and 
pricing problems in the California market.  In summary, the proposal would 
have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids 
for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.  The gov asked if anyone had 
successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.

I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or 
North American) by mid day Monday. Jeff and I will have a follow up call with 
the governor on Monday.

Thanks
