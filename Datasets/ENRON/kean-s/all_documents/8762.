Here's the outline we sent to FERC yesterday.? I had sent the  following=20
e-mail last week to Dan Larcamp and Ellen Schall (OGC) of FERC.

?=20

Dan =01) I am a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at  George Ma=
son=20
University.? I recently  taught a course to FERC staff on energy derivative=
s,=20
and based on that and  discussions with others, think you might benefit fro=
m=20
a broader course to help  FERC staff and commissioners understand prices an=
d=20
energy markets, particularly  the relationship between cash or spot markets=
,=20
and financial markets (including  derivatives).?=20

We at the Mercatus Center are in a unique position to serve  as a resource =
to=20
the Commission and staff on economic/financial issues.? We are a nonprofit,=
=20
research, education,  outreach organization, and, as part of our mission ar=
e=20
organized to work with  the administration on different regulatory and mark=
et=20
issues.? We would offer the course at no  charge.

We have in mind a team of experts in energy markets with  unique experience=
s=20
and?  perspectives.

Prof. Bill Albrecht, of  Iowa State University is a former commissioner at=
=20
the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission.? He was there  in the aftermath =
of=20
the Crash of =01+87, during the Gulf War and other market  crises, and has =
a=20
valuable understanding of the issues FERC is facing now,  with respect to t=
he=20
influence of trading and derivative markets on energy  prices.
Jerry Ellig, Ph.D., is  a senior research fellow at Mercatus and has done=
=20
extensive research and  teaching on market infrastructure issues,=20
particularly in energy markets.
Prof. Vernon Smith, who  has recently joined the faculty of GMU and the=20
Mercatus Center, is known as  the father of experimental economics.?  You m=
ay=20
be familiar with his sophisticated economic =01&experiments,=018  which off=
er hands=20
on experience with energy markets, including transmission  constraints, etc=

and allow participants and researchers to test market  reactions to differe=
nt=20
rules, events, etc.
I  am a former CFTC economist, and write and teach courses on risk and risk=
 =20
management in energy markets.? =20

Professor Albrecht will be in the area on July 25-26.? Two 3-hour sessions =
on=20
those days  (starting in the afternoon after your Commission meeting on the=
=20
25th)  would provide a strong introduction to these issues.? We could then=
=20
talk about whether future  courses or workshops would be valuable.

I will call you tomorrow to discuss this idea.
