 The situation continues to be stable.=01; CLHB has reinitated LPG operatio=

LaPaz, but continue their inspection.=01; TR will not reinitiate gas or cru=
de=20
export operations until we have completed our inspection.=01; We have forme=

joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.=01; It =
could=20
take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we get a=
=20
progress report in the morning.=01;=01; All crews available systemwide are=
=20
mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority=20
continues to be the lines in the altiplano.=01; The three stations in the=
=20
altiplano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.=01; Other supervisors=
=20
throughout the system have been advised and are on alert.

 Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and=20
inspection action plan.=01; We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE=
 (the=20
regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute energy=
=20
out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz=01; - this should cover LaPaz'=
s=20
electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our=20
inspection.=01; The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant=
 in=20
LaPaz.=01; We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and prov=
ide=20
only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

 We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received=20
inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia=
ns=20
this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system.=
=01; We=20
are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to the=20
volatility of the issue in LaPaz.=01; Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed =
with=20
the message.

 We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack=
=20
should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.=01=
; In=20
either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a=20
notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to=20
safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes=

necessary.

 The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local=20
revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.=01; Morales ha=

contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so=

 At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line=
=20
in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.=01; Our OSSA II (crude ex=
ports=20

been taken out with the bomb.=01; We understand that the bomb, which had a=
=20
manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.=01; Th=
e=20
Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediate=
=20
threat neutralized.

 However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days =
of=20
sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will=
=20
notify the Enron Crisis team.

 We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a=
=20
joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano=20
network.=01; The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start =
to go=20
out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary powe=

fuel supply.=01; I've notified all relevant government authorities of the=

o=20
look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result =
of=20
an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be=
=20
helpful.

 Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations=20
throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to=20
perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.=01=
;=20
Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the=20
altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.=01; We =

as our people complete the overall plan.

 I will keep you posted as things develop.=20
