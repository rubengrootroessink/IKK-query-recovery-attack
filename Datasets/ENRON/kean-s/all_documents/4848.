Is this a 2001 question?  If so it seems to me we shouldn't bother with it.  
If this is a 2002 question, then let;s discuss

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
"Environment" nor "Environmental policy and compliance". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our "Chief Environmental Officer". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

Subject: Corporate Allocations April 2001

All, please review the below Corporate allocations for April.  Total 
allocations for the month are below plan by $1.1m.  Congratulations to HR who 
managed to get a net credit from Corp of $165k.  If you have any questions 
please get back to your management accountant or myself.



regards,
