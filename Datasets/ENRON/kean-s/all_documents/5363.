Can any of you meet with Professor Littlechild on 23 April.  He has a small 
consulting services contract with me, to write on liberalisation of energy 
markets.  his current work is devoted to, among other thins, debunking 
Joskow, et al., on the argument that most of the benefits of liberalisation 
are cpatureed at the wholesale level, and he argues that a 
working/funcitoning retail market, and corresponding contracts market for 
risk management, is paramount to ultimate success (very Enron).  He comes 
across very much as an academic (Jeff Dasovich heard him speak on this 
subject in San Francisco, and he has spoken in Tokyo), and very Staid 
British, but he was electricity regulator in UK for 9 years, and is 
indisputably a top academic, so he carries some status when he speaks.  i 
would hope that all 3 of you could make some time with him, and any toerhs 
you could think of.  Your response/thoughts?   thanks  mcs

Dear Mark
?
I was just talking to Kyran, who mentioned your  impending move back to 
Houston. I shall be disappointed to see you go, but  congratulate you and 
wish you well.? Two things.
1. Any further thoughts on the work we began to  talk about,and envisaged in 
the contract? Or shall I wait to hear from your  successor?
2. We spoke some time ago about a possible visit to  Houston. I shall be in 
DC on Friday 20 April and Austin on weekend of 21/22  April. I thought of 
visiting on Monday 23 April if that would be convenient and  if relevant 
people would be available. My main interest would be Enron thinking  on US 
developments such as retail, California, trading, Pools versus bilateral  
markets, capacity auctions etc. Also Enron global strategy in other  
countries.
?
I gather you're off on holiday now. Enjoy the last  dose of British weather - 
if you 
can.
?
Best wishes
Stephen
