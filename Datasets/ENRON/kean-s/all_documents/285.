Spoke to Nick O'Day.  He and Paul Quilkey already have advanced ideas about 
his replacement (something half commercial/half regulatory), and possibly 
filled in the interim with a "semi-parttime" consultant.  Tom Briggs came 
into my office and is willing to relocate for a year.  I would prefer to have 
Tom there, let Paul hire whatever he needs commercially (FYI- Tom's wife is 
commercial, and probably could do a "bang up" job for Paul).  I am no 
shrinking violet (as you probably know), but have been loathe to impose 
myself/my views, at this early date, but I am not thrilled to hear that Nick 
has cooked up a solution with Paul that he and I never discussed, after you 
and I have talked about Tom, and gotten Tom's interest aroused (it seems 
unfair to Tom to tantalise him with job prospects if we are going to take 
them back; same issue I suppose you have with Terry).   I think a hybrid 
commercial/regulatory role is fine (and Tom could do it).  By the way, the 
org. charts do not show it, but Nick has a subordinate, Reg. Aff. Mgr., 
Robert McGrory, already in place.  Nick also suggested Mike Grimes going to 
Tokyo on expat assignment (discussed some time ago with Mike, but apparently 
not recently).  Your thoughts?  If you can call me after 1000 your time, 
would like to discuss.  I think you have successfully killed Terry's mass 
meeting in London.  he and I are meeting for a few hours tomorrow morning.  
thanks  mcs
