Steve:

This was posted today in the Idea Vault.  We've bounced it around (Karen, 
Mary, etc.) and we'd like to run it past you.  It would be nice if Enron 
contributed to the solution -- since we've contributed to some of the 
problem!  Mary says perhaps you could bring this up at the next Executive 
Committee meeting.

Thanks.

Traffic Relief (Category: Best Practices)
Enron needs to do its part to relieve frustration with downtown traffic. The 
downtown street project and construction of Enron Center South have collided 
to create an unbelievable traffic problem. Enron should strongly encourage 
flexible work schedules during this period.

How the idea benefits Enron:
Enron employees will be much less stressed and more productive as a result.

Target audience and value:
Enron upper management needs to offer incentives to departments with the most 
creative and effective flexible work schedule.

Competition:
None.

Time, technology, resources required to develop idea:
The creativity for creating flexible work schedules from telecommuting to 
4-day work weeks will come from existing employees. No additional resources 
are required.

Challenges and risks involved:
Our challenge is to continue to produce high quality results. The risks 
involved could vary from underscheduling of resources (due to unplanned off 
duty)to slower response times for dial-in telecommuters.
