Subject: Peer Group Mapping

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This 
mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each 
activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to 
David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group 
mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a 
functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed 
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All 
functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the 
acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1 to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in 
previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  
as indicated on the attachment.

3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider 
questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final 
VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for 
your ease of
      reference.
