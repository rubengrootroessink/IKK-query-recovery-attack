		 Subject: Visit to Enron by Three Eisenhower Exchange Fellows (EEF) from India

Steve, Jim, Mike:

You may be aware that Enron officials have in the past met with international 
opinion leaders visiting the US as part of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
(EEF) program. The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that 
promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of 
information, ideas, and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the 
world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees.

Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday, October 18, 
2000:

Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia, Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory 
Commission; 
Mr. Sreenivasan Jain, Newscaster, New Delhi TV; and 
Mr. Jawed Usmani, Joint Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister.

I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons, two of whom -  
Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about 
the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about 
US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to 
attached bios for more details).

I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons 
for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly, if Mike could be 
available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues. Please let me 
know if you are available either between 10:00 - 12:00 noon or 3:30 - 5:00 
p.m. on Wednesday, October 18, 2000. If you are unavailable, it would be 
appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard.

Many thanks,

Johan
