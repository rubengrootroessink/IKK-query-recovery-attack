Judging from the latest agenda, we seem to have had a communications
mix-up: Grundfest can't come, etc. So let me set out my understanding of the
agenda as it now exists. We should keep this flexible as I have taken the
liberty of inviting Karl Shapiro, from Berkeley, to join us and make a
presentation based on his experience in the Intel, Microsoft and related
cases, and in the FTC action against BP's entry into trading. Karl has
written the best book on the subject of network monopolies, copies of which I
will circulate if he says "yes", which I will know by Tuesday mid-day. The
point of his presentation would be to consider whether Enron's "dominance" of
some of the markets in which it operates and which it makes contains the
seeds of future problems. If we land Shapiro, we can move Kristol back to the
dinner slot, or fold the California session into the dinner report by Enron
executives.
I would suggest that we advise those who received the agenda that it is
being substantially revised, lest those that I have told to prepare talks
think they are off the hook, and Davies gets upset about the schedule. We can
then send out a final agenda later this week.
I have briefed Kristol, Portney, Davies and Ghemawat to try to make their
presentations a bit more Enron-specific than in the past.
Dinner
Usual review by Enron executives of latest developments.
Wednesday
Because my understanding is that Gavyn Davies has to leave early, we
should schedule the economic review by him and by Larry Kudlow as the first
presentation.
8:00-8:45 Gavyn Davies: Developments in the world     economy, with special
emphasis on those that might affect Enron.
8:45-9:30 Larry Kudlow: Developments in the US economy; likely policy
reactions.
9:30-10:30 Discussion, perhaps with Jeff leading off with "what worries us
most".
10:30-11:00 Coffee break and continued discussion.
11:00-12:00 The California situation: Report by Enron and discussion of the
implications of the California situation for future policy and Enron
prospects.
12:00-12:30 The political situation: Bill Kristol.
12:30-1:30 Lunch and discussion of Kristol report, with Ken Lay adding his
information and appraisal.
1:30-2:00 Environmental policy: with emphasis on whether recent changes are
likely to affect Enron. Paul Portney.
2:00-2:30 Discussion of Portney presentation.
2:30-3:00 The availability to Enron of human capital. Pankaj Ghemawat will
review what he and his Harvard colleagues, as well as other experts, are
saying about the ability of companies such as Enron, no longer small, to
continue to attract the best and the brightest.
3:00-3:45: Discussion of Pankaj's presentation, perhaps led by Steve Kean.
