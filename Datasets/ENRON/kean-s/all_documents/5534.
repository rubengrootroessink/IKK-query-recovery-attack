Mr. Kean,

I've attached a document outlining a proposal for an associate in Enron's
Capital & Risk Management Services division to come and speak in several
graduate and undergraduate classes this semester. Times and dates are 
extremely
negotiable. I will make all necessary arrangements to ensure a pleasant visit.

Thank you for your time and have a great day. I look forward to hearing from
you.

Sincerely,

Rene Chapoton
