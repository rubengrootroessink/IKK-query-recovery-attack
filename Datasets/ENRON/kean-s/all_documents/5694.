This is a follow-up to my voice mail on the MESB claim.  Our draft statement 
(still needs final EGA and legal review) is attached.  In addition, a 
presentation on the issue (for internal use only) appears at the bottom of 
this string of e-mails.  We expect the issue to hit the press modestly 
tomorrow.

John

I actually have not checked this out yet.  As a result, I would not publish 
it further without circling back with the group.  Still, I think it's a good 
place to start on the issue.

Subject: Presentation on Misdeclaration for the lenders

Attached please find the presentation on misdeclaration for the lenders.  
Robert Mathis has prepared a draft of the letter to the lenders which 
essentially discusses most of the points highlighted in the presentation and 
thus we might decide not to include the presentation at all.  

However I would appreciate your comments at the earliest if we decide to 
include the presentation.
