Subject: Console Tape Recordings


Steve Kean is requesting that tape recorders be installed on the 10 ACD 
consoles that the operators use. Bomb Threats and personal threats  to Ken 
Lay have been received regularly through out the last week.

A Task Force is being formed to handle these types of calls.

Please charge this Co.0901 Rc.100158. If you need further information please 
contact me, ext.36342
This needs to be done ASAP.........




Thanks ..............
