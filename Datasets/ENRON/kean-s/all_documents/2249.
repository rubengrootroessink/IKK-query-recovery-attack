I am including some ideas for mom and dad for  Christmas.? I checked on their 
internet access which is due to run out:  they are supposed to recieve a disk 
from Dell which will provide them with an  additional year of internet 
access?at no charge, so that is  covered.
?
Gift ideas:
?
1.? cell phone for mom?& dad for  emergencies and ?so mom could leave the  
house and dad can get in touch with her - whether someone is sitting with dad 
or  not/emergency panic button for dad.? Here's a link to a simple device 
which  is emergency ONLY

?
otherwise, I know that Verizon services  Dubuque
?
2.? a second (more up to date) cordless phone  for downstairs so that m & d 
can answer the phone without having to  run
?
3. insulated cups, a set of knives which hold an  edge, blender/food processor
?
4.?boxed movie sets of old movies
?
5.? gift certificates to restaurants which  offer takeout (i.e. Olive Garden)
?
?
Any thoughts?
