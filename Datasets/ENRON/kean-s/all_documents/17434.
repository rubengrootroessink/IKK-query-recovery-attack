I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure 
relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the 
process works in practice.  A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria 
etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should 
remain purely relative.

Subject: PRC cluster descriptors - draft

All;

Aattached are a draft of the PRC cluster descriptors which we discussed 
several weeks back.  I has sent a first draft to Michelle and Dick, and both 
had some suggestions which I have tried to incorporate.  I am still awaiting 
Dick and Michelle's impressions of the below, but also  look forward to your 
impressions and input. Likewise I would appreciate your input on whether or 
not we need to change the ratings on the feedback forms to numerical ratings 
1-5 to mimic the clusters.  look forward to hearing from you,  Many thanks, 
Gina

Subject: descriptors again

Dick; here is another try at the descriptors.  I tried to apply the 
information you provided and to describe qualities of an employee's 
performance . I'm  not sure whether this is any better, but would appreciate 
your input.  What I am finding most challenging writing descriptors which are 
interchangeable with all levels and job groups within the company.  The 
behaviors these describe and measure need to be general in nature so that 
they can apply to a VP and an admin assistant, as well as to all four Peer 
Groups within Enron.  

Likewise, I would appreciate your thoughts on the necessity/value of changing 
the feedback forms to reflect the same numerical ratings.  presently the 
feedback forms use the same descriptors as the cluster (i.e. Superior - 
Issues).  In your opinion should these also be 1-5 ratings with one = to 
highest and 5= to lowest in scale?  
I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions.  You may either 
e-mail me or call me on 713 345-3377.  Many thanks in advance, Gina
