MEMORANDUM

RE: California Order Proxy Price Calculation

We have had an initial opportunity to review FERC's Order Establishing 
Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale 
Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation of Public Utility Rates in 
Wholesale Western Energy Markets, and will provide a more detailed summary 
early next week.

However, questions have arisen as to the calculation of the proxy price when 
a stage 1, 2 or 3 emergency is called.  In initial discussions with FERC 
staff, we have determined that the price mitigation will work as follows:

For the following day, the ISO will publish at 8 a.m. an average of the daily 
prices published in Gas Daily for all California delivery points, as well as 
emissions costs.  The emissions costs will be calculated by the ISO using the 
Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Service.  The marginal unit will 
then be determined via the single price auction in the hour, and the ISO will 
then take the previously submitted and confidential heat rate data and 
multiply it by the posted average gas price and emissions costs for that hour 
to determine the market clearing price.  The ISO will not be calculating an 
estimated market-clearing price in advance.
