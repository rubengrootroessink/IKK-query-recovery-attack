Here are the latest Q and As.  FYI, we have toned down the message on the 
amount of oil.  While we still do not have a final figure, it looks like it 
could be around 20,000 barrels spilled.  We have never publicly released a 
figure but have stated it might not be as high as the figure cited in news 
stories, which was 25,000 barrels.
