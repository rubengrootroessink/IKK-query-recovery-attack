Dear Steve and Bill,

In case you have not already seen it, I thought you might be interested in
the recent posting on a French website of an announcement of Andre LeGallo's
departure from Enron and some commentary about the company's purported links
to the CIA and the US political establishment.

This website can be accessed at www.intelligenceonline.com.  It is believed
to be published by French persons with close connections to the French
security services and also, reportedly, to Israeli intelligence.  The
website includes free content (of which this report was a part) and premium
content available on a subscription basis only.  The Andre LeGallo posting
could reflect the purely detached academic/professional interest of the
publishing entity.  It is also worth considering that it would be a
convenient document for one of your competitors to pass on to a foreign
government with whom you might be negotiating, particularly if that
government had elements or constituencies sensitive to the perception of
links to U.S. intelligence.

Please let me know if you would like any further information on this matter.

Best regards

Edward



(INTELLIGENCE NEWSLETTER #376 - 17/02/2000)
UNITED STATES : Enron Loses Intelligence Star
The U.S. gas and electricity utility Enron has parted ways with Andre Le
Gallo who was in charge of dealing with the group's most sensitive cases. A
former CIA official known for his extreme discretion, Le Gallo quit the
Houston-based company in January to open his own business intelligence firm,
AJL Global Risks Solutions.
His recent departure was known to only a few North American consultants. In
his job as Enron's vice president for security, Le Gallo had worked behind
the scenes on all of the difficult cases facing the group that required
maximum confidentiality.
Some believe his career with Enron served to underline the close links that
reportedly exist between the company and the CIA. The first claims to that
effect were made in the early 1990s when Kenneth Lay, founder and president
of Enron appeared as a major financial backer of then-U.S. president George
Bush. It was said Enron won favors from the American intelligence community,
with the White House's blessings.
One instance supposedly occurred in June, 1992 in India when Enron's local
affiliate Dabhol Power Company won the right to operate on huge gas
resources at Maharashtra near Bombay, in highly controversial circumstances.
At the time, Indian political leaders suspected the American ambassador in
New Delhi, Franck Wisner, of having asked the CIA station chief in the
Indian capital to ensure Enron won the contract. A few years later, on Dec.
15, 1997, the same Franck Wisner was named a director of Enron Gas & Oil Co.
In a further example of ambiguous links, the State Department is accused of
also backing Enron in 1993 in negotiations for a contract to restore oil
wells on the Shuaiba field in Kuwait that had been damaged during the Gulf
War. Enron got the contract even though its bid was less advantageous than a
lower bid submitted by Germany's Deutsche Babcock. The existence of ties
between the former Bush administration and Enron can be seen in a new light
in view of the coming presidential campaign in the U.S. According to a
report by the Federal Election Commission, Bush's son --George W. Bush --
has already used an aircraft owned by the Enron company seven times since he
began his race for the presidency.
