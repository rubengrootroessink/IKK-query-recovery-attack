I'm afraid we have our work cut out for us.  We have been working the proces 
at the state and federal level in the past couple of weeks.  I continue to

Subject: CA Price caps

I heard you've been raising a ruckus about our activities on the price caps 
-- asking us to do more.  Thanks.  I feel as if I have been a voice in the 
wilderness for the past six months when I was trying to get people to pay 
attention to the bad things happening in CA and warning that the problems 
(mainly a threat of reregulation) will spread elsewhere.
