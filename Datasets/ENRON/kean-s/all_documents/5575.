Two documents:
First is the external document we faxed to certain reporters.
This is what Steve is referring to.


Second is the talking points which reflect all changes to date.
I am waiting legal approval - which I'm expecting any minute
(I emailed Mike Smith your changes last night).   



We should put both on website as soon as I track down Mike or Vicki. 

Thanks,
Peggy

Peggy --

My understanding is that you and Steve Kean finished these talking points.  
Can I please get the final copy?

Jim
