calendar.
Also, I would like you to set up a meeting with me, Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney, 
Kelly Kimberly, Mark koenig, Rick Causey, and Rick Buy.  I was thinking the 
easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 
6 or 6:30 some evening.  I have contacted Beth and Cindy already, so they 
know what it is about, and I will leave messages for the others.  I just need 
to check schedules for now.

Also,  I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once 
a month or so for the Public Affairs organization.  Nothing fancy . .  . 
Cadillac Bar or something similar. . .  spouses and significant others 
invited.  Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know 
what you come up with.
