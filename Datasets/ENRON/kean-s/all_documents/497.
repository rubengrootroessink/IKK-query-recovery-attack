Subject: Ohio regulations regarding certification, market monitoring, ADR, 
and electric service standards

The Ohio Commission has recently adopted several sets of administrative rules 
required by the state's electric restructuring law.  Rules have been issued 
specifiying certification requirements and procedures, reporting requirements 
for the Commission's monitoring of the retail marketplace, alternative 
dispute resolution, non-competitive electric service standards, and 
competitive retail electric service standards.  A document follows, 
summarizing some of the major highlights of the adopted rules.  As 
promulgated, the rules regarding certification and market monitoring are not 
overly burdensome.  The competitive electric service standards are a mixed 
bag, e.g. imposing significant duties regarding contract disclosure and term, 
while providing for telephonic and Internet enrollment.  
  
Please direct any questions regarding the rules to me.
