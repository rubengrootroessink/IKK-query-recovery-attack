COLOMBIA: Colombia sets new date for key utility privatization.
12/13/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOGOTA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The embattled Colombian government on Wednesday 
set a deadline of June 30 next year for its often delayed privatization of 
state-run power generator ISAGEN. 
The 1,636 megawatt generator, the country's third-largest and valued at about 
$450 million, was most recently due to have been sold by Sept. 30 as part of 
a year-old plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund to help boost 
government revenues and meet tight budget targets.
But it was delayed indefinitely until just last week when the Council of 
State - a tribunal set up to resolve disputes between the government and 
private sector - struck down an injunction blocking the sale that was based 
on a complaint from Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), Colombia's largest 
public utility. 
EPM has argued that it has been unfairly excluded from the bidding process 
for ISAGEN by government regulators, on grounds that its ownership of the 
company would violate antitrust laws by giving it a virtual monopoly over 
Colombia's power generating capacity. 
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos said in September that the government was 
determined to finalize the ISAGEN sell-off by the end of this year, once the 
Council of State ruled as expected in the government's favor. 
But Santos, who spoke to reporters as he emerged from a cabinet meeting at 
the presidential palace, said legal loopholes, possible changes in the 
price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its 
privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30. 
"We have to restart this whole process. We're going to study the valuation 
and reopen negotiations with possible buyers to see how we can put ISAGEN up 
for sale at the best price as soon as possible," Santos said. 
The sale of ISAGEN, considered one of the crown jewels in the government's 
troubled privatization program, had originally been expected to take place 
last December. It was later slated for the first half of 2000, at a time when 
government sources said leading bidders included U.S. energy group Enron . 
The sell-off in the first half of this year was delayed, until the elusive 
Sept. 30 deadline, amid a flurry of attacks on the national power grid by 
Marxist rebel saboteurs and legal challenges to the sale from ISAGEN's own 
labor union.

2:58 (Dow Jones) As credit quality concerns dog investors, Bear Stearns' 
analyst Amy Butte says in a report Wednesday that investment banks are 
increasing liquidity to historically high levels, which could be a sign of 
either a more conservative bent or a premonition of risk, she said. (CWM)
2:48 (Dow Jones) Gridlock may put some of Bush's measures, such as school 
vouchers and Social Security privatization, on hold. But rebel Democrats may 
help pass all or most of Bush's tax cuts, says economist Ian Morris at HSBC. 
That wouldn't prevent hard landing in 2001, but the stimulus will be felt by 
2002. By 2003, Morris says, the surplus could be more like $250 billion than 
CBO's projected $400 billion. (SV) 
2:39 (Dow Jones) OK, so it wasn't an unprecedented ruling that determined our 
next president, but there was a big ruling in the HMO arena concerning 
provider lawsuits. Chase H&Q calls judge's decision granting certain parts 
and denying other parts of various defendant's motions a minor victory for 
HMOs. Ruling positive for Wellpoint (WLP) and Aetna (AET), mildly positive 
for Cigna (CI) and United Healthcare (UNH), mixed for PacifiCare (PHSY), and 
has no impact on Humana (HUM). (TG) 
2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory, 
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more 
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings 
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers, 
off-floor traders say. "We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than 
where we are today," he said. (ZHS) 
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC) 
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value" 
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC 
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG) 
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook 
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for 
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said 
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the 
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in 
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition, 
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to 
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins, 
according to Lucey. (SEW) 
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.: 
"With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the 
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a 
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him, 
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the 
nation's needs." (JC) 
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week 
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond 
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec. 
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield 
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP) 
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza 
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive 
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine 
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan 
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are "priced for perfection and expectations are 
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock." Shares fell about 
8.5%. (BMM) 
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees 
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings 
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or 
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC) 
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth 
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential 
administration. "I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave 
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a 
Bush cabinet," Lay said in an interview. (MPG) 
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids 
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill 
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since 
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks 
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00 
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that "the main 
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole." As a 
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock.

the companies reach critical mass. 
12:21 (Dow Jones) Wounded Linux stocks rallying for second straight day after 
IBM CEO Gerstner said Tuesday that Big Blue would invest $1 billion next year 
commercializing the renegade operating system. After seeing their stocks drop 
as much as 95% this year, Red Hat (RHAT), VA Linux, (LNUX) and Caldera (CALD)

12:14 (Dow Jones) Stanley Furniture's (STLY) 4Q sales and earns warning comes 
on same day that Commerce, in its retail sales report, said overall furniture 
sales surged 1.5% in Nov. - biggest monthly jump in about a year. Maybe 
coincidental, maybe a holiday phenom. But it's still interesting that sales 
climbing amid clear signs of general earnings weakness in furniture business. 
Stanley, a thinly traded stock, off 8% at 21.32. (GC) 
12:10 (Dow Jones) Bond market issuance was down 25% during the first three 
quarters of the year amid the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign, the Bond 
Market Association says. Total issuance totaled $1.6 trillion through Sept. 
to $15.6 trillion in outstanding debt. (MSD) 
11:57 (Dow Jones) Veritas (VRTS) continues to feel pressure (shares down 6%) 
amid concerns it will suffer from weakness in Sun Microsystems' (SUNW) server 
business, which accounts for a chunk of its storage software sales. But 
Merrill defends Veritas, saying it's on track to meet or exceed fourth 
quarter targets and investors should use volatility to load up on Veritas. 
(MLP) 
11:51 (Dow Jones) A lot of news and bond friendly data today, but not any big 
changes in sentiment. As tech names trade in negative territory, Treasurys 
are holding a bid. But traders say flows are going both ways, suggesting that 
a rebound in stocks will be enough to push Treasury prices back toward 
unchanged on the day. (SV)L)

on same day that Commerce, in its retail sales report, said overall furniture

2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC)
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value"

$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG)
