Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the 
Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA 
dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by  Stan Horton who had 
decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for 
and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when 
AGA "kicked" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of 
sub membership for around 85K.

AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about 
renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and 
later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got 
back to them as promised.  This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of 
Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be 
calling Lay.

It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might 
be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.
