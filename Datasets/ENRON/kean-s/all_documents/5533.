This is a very good try.  I think it comes off too defensive and too genera=
l=20
(I just don't think the topic lends itself to the format).  Here's what I=
=20
think we should do: Jeff is filming a piece for etv about the stock price. =
=20
We should perhaps use, and expand upon, those messages.  This approach is=
=20
more directed at the bottom line: why our stock price should go up.

Thanks Steve.  Here's an initial draft -- I've taken a very light "eBizy"=

approach to delivering the message.  Perhaps by having some fun with it we=

can look a little less defensive.  Let me know if we're on track or pitiful=

Comparing Enron to Apples

You may have noticed =01) or you may be asking why =01) industry analysts o=
ften=20
compare Enron to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs or investment banks=

like Chase Manhattan.  We thought it was time to sort out any confusion=20
between our businesses, just in case someone asks you to explain.  Here's h=

we're different from those guys:
w Enron provides physical delivery of energy products to customers =01) we =
are=20
not just traders.  Those guys mainly act as brokers and do not participate=

physically.
w Enron proactively seeks to reform and create markets.  Those guys simply=

participate and compete.
w Enron extends its business model into new and deregulating markets,=20
enabling high growth rates.  Those guys are in markets that generate less=

w Enron owns physical assets that provide consistent cash flow, such as our=

pipelines.  Those guys do not have them.

And if that's not enough, we think our employees are so much cooler than=20
theirs.
