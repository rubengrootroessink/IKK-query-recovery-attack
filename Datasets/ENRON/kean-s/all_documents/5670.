Apologized that she could not meet with Steve yesterday.  She would like to 
have this meeting.  She asked that we schedule this for your next trip to 
DC.  I think we should do this meeting soon.  Do you want me to get on her 
calendar and then build a day of meetings around her meeting?  Or wait until 
you are otherwise back in town?
