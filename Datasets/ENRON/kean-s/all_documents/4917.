There were several items in the mail pouch that you needed a response form me 
on.  Here are the responses:

Marchris forwarded a request to attend a conference on Aug 19 and 20.  I 
think the original invite when to Ken and Jeff.  I will attend, subject to 
them getting some reasonable response rate from the commissioners they 
invited and provided that I get a speaking or similar participation 
opportunity.
