Regarding voicemail I left you regading my current compensation, I  do not 
intend to bug you about this, but at some point, I would appreciate knowing 
whether my  base compensation ( and stock compensation  given recent price 
movements )  are set at the appropriate level, in relationship to peers in 
public affairs, company, and externally. Thanks.
