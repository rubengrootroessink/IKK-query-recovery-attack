Steve, look, I am just trying to get a complete explanation of why NEPCO can 
not bid during the competitive process for the Cayote II Project.  Can 
someone give me an adult level explanation?  I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

I think Paul Kaufman made the call on this from Steve Keanes' shop. I
think it was the right call, given the complexity of the regulatory issues
involved. >> Larry L Izzo at ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/08 12:28 PM >>>

Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators.

Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even 
participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It 
seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
process?

Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely 
necessary.  Thanks for your help.
