Observations on the California Energy Crisis
The White House Writers Group
January 31st



Gray Davis has announced that he will soon announce two energy czars to lead 
the state through the current crisis. ?Logical candidates include: Laurel and 
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Beavis and Butthead, and Siegfried and Roy.

The environmentalist Green Party is well-named. ?Thanks to its role in 
blocking construction of new power plants, Californians are forking over 
plenty of green for energy.

California?s power industry is very Kennedyesque. ?Their message to consumers 
is, "Ask not what your energy company can do for you; ask what you can do for 
your energy company."

Congress might get involved in California?s energy crisis. ?There?s nothing a 
drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him.

It?s one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy problem 
to go back to the drawing board, but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy 
them a new one?

In California, lawmakers are now getting down to details. ?The latest debate 
involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the 
utilities. ?Proposals on the table include: ?Blackout Bonds;Bailout Bonds; 
Davis Debts; Blunder Bonds; Fiasco Funds.
