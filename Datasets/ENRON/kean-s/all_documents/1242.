A bit lengthy, but I think it looks fine.

Subject: Starwood Draft

Attached is a draft of the Starwood press release with our initial changes in 
red.
Please review and let me know your thoughts by end of day Thursday, Aug 31.   

It is clear that Starwood has several agendas with this release and, after 
talking with
them, they would prefer not to cut any of their messages.  Scheduled release 
date is
Tuesday, Sept 5.  Please feel free to call me to discuss.  

Also - I've attached a map of all their US owned, franchised and leased 
property locations.
87 of the properties are owned and there are approx. 400 total in the US.
