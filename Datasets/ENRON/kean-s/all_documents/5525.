Steve,

I mentioned that my brother, an attorney in New York, is active in state 
politics and might be a useful contact in the state. I'm following up with 
this note to let you know a bit more about him. 

Larry Mandelker is a partner with Kantor, Davidoff Wolfe Mandelker & Kass in 
New York City. He is outside counsel to the Republican State Committee and 
represented Bill Powers when he recently joined the Crane Group in Albany. 
Larry works closely with the Crane Group's legal operation, Crane Green & 
Parente, in many state matters.

There's another reason why I thought to mention Larry. He currently 
represents Sunset Energy Fleet, a company managed by Jerry Montrose, which is 
negotiating to win state permits for barge-mounted generation off of Brooklyn 
as well as gas supply contracts. He knows exactly what the power industry 
faces in New York.

If anyone would like to contact him, I'll forward that person's name to him. 
I'll give you his telephone number, too --
212-682-8383 x 30 -- if you'd like to file it away.

Please let me know if there's any additional information you'd like to see.

Take care,
Jeannie
