Steve and Rick,

This is just to inform you that I have been involved with the Camisea gas 
project in Peru since Shell-Mobil developed it several years ago. As you can 
see in the article below, Enron is one of the possible candidates for getting 
the transportation and distribution contract. I am in continuous contact with 
Roberto Pensotti, the lead developer for the this deal. Roberto knows that I 
have strong contacts in the government and the private sector in Peru, and I 
would be more than happy to help in any way possible. I will keep you posted 
on this issue. Regards, Vinio
