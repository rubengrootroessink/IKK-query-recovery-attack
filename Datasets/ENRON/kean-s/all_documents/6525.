If you were wondering why Hebert, speaking at the meeting  said that he would 
certainly be viewed as a Grinch, here is a transcript of a poem read on NPR 
last week.  It is meant to be read with the same timing as Dr. Suess's 
Grinch.  Thanks to Leslie Comnes (a California ratepayer whom I hold in high 
regard) for transcribing:

The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
Love the Christmas light season, the lights are first rate.
They glitter, they sparkle all red, white, and blue-ish,
They impress even Whos who are ACLUish.
They dazzle the neighborhoods hour by hour,
'til someone says, "Shut them off! We're out of power."
Just who is the source of this Christmas light pinch?
Does the great Golden State have its very own Grinch?
Does the smog belching, grease guzzling junk TV creep
Take lights out of Christmas, so children will weep?
We'll catch and declaw him, it sounds rather simple,
Yet much more complex than a Florida dimple.
We'll trap him by leaving a late evening snack out,
Not that he'll see it at night in a blackout.
The Whos grasp at straws, "There's one man who can save us,"
And they hang their Who hopes on their governor, Davis.
"He'll light the state tree, and he'll keep it ablaze, 
and the white fir will glow for the next 30 days!"
The Gov lights the tree, and he says with a scoff,
"30 days? 30 minutes! Now turn that thing off!"
But Davis a Grinch? That would be quite a climb,
His gig's raising money, it takes all his time.
"Who, then?" demand all the Whos and Who's Whos.
"Who cut the juice? Tell us now, we need clues!"
Well, now some blame the cold in the arctic Northwest, 
But others say that power plants close for a rest.
Some say it's FERC, yet don't know what FERC means,
But they think that some FERC jerk messed with power machines.
Some blame El Nino, and some cite Cal-ISO [?],
But no one will rule out H. Ross Perot.
The blackouts are rolling out Stage 1, 2, and 3.
They're saying, "Cut power, de-sparkle your tree!"
Men walk on the moon and invent penicillin, 
So wouldn't you think they could find us a villain?
The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
See Christmas light evenings start two hours late.
Is it too much to ask, just one culprit to lynch? 
It's just so unfair that we can't find a Grinch!
