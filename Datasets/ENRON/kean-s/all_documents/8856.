I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU.  
Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification)

Subject: UC-CSU-Enron press release


Attached is a draft of the UC-CSU-Enron press release concerning the 
settlement agreement.  Please review and let me know of any revisions or 
suggestions.  We would like for this to go out tomorrow if possible.  We're 
still waiting for a quote from CSU.  I'll make sure you see that as well.  
Thank you.  Max
