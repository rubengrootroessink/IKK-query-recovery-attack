Steve:

Chris Holmes recommended I contact you concerning the attached inquiry.  I 
recently met with a federal representative from San Diego who had asked if I 
could send him any information on Enron's ability to hedge energy prices.  
After a summer of rolling brown outs and soaring prices, he is looking for 
ways to avoid the scenario in the future.

Could you recommend the best avenue for responding to this request?

I appreciate you assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Michael

Hello Chris:

I hope you and your family are doing well.  I am sorry to have fallen out of 
touch.

I was thinking of you recently wen speaking with a Congressional 
representative from San Diego.  After a summer of rolling brown outs and  
increasing prices from the utilities, he was searching for an energy 
solution.  Who would be the best contact within EES or ENA to explore the 
possibilities for the city of San Diego?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Michael
