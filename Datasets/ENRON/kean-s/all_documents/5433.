Lou,

Here are a few talking points for the program...note that the loan to 
employees covering excercise cost has to be recourse (we're looking into the 
impact of this new information from AA).

If you'd like to discuss the details behind any of the points, feel free to 
call me at 713 853 9280 or 713 303 4633.

Aaron
