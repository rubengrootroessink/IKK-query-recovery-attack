Rick and Mark,

We have identified the next  20 non-US and non-European assets for regulatory 
risk review.  Please advise us if we missed any other important assets that 
come to your mind.  In addition, could you please confirm that we have 
designated the appropriate EGA professional for each asset? 

We would like to conclude this phase of review by  July 7th.


Thank you very much for your help.




Gia and John
