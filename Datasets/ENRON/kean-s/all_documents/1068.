Orange County/State briefs: Truckee firm offers cut-rate electricity

August 16, 2000

Orange County Register

A Truckee company is selling electricity for 8 cents per kilowatt hour, far
less than what many south Orange County residents have been paying this
summer. TenderLand Power Co. will guarantee the flat rate for a year,
starting Oct. 1, for up to 60,000 customers. That equates to roughly 5
percent of all the customers now using San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

This week, SDG&E is selling electricity for 17.6 cents per kilowatt hour.

Residents may want to wait before switching, because a cut in SDG&E bills
could be in the offing, said Jodi Beebe at the Utility Consumers' Action
Network in San Diego.

TenderLand Invites 60,000 Electricity Customers to Opt Out of Electric Rate
Crisis

Business Wire

(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

TRUCKEE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2000--TenderLand Power Company
has invited 60,000 California electricity customers on a first-come,
first-served basis to choose TenderLand, receive a flat electric generation
rate, and stand up for their right under deregulation to switch away from
San Diego Gas & Electric, thereby completely opting out of the rate crisis
being experienced by SDG&E customers.

In response to the high electric rates in San Diego, the California
Legislature as well as the California Public Utilities Commission has
proposed laws and procedures which create a deferred payment plan disguised
as a lower, or "frozen" fixed electric rate plan. The proposed directives
may require even those electric customers who switch or plan to switch from
SDG&E to pay for the costs of this "electric rate loan" whether or not they
receive their power from an alternative electric service provider like
TenderLand. Clearly, such a situation would infringe upon the rights of
electric ratepayers participating in a deregulated electricity market, as
they may still be forced to pay added costs for expensive energy purchased
by their local electricity distribution utility (like SDG&E) and consumed by
the utility's own customers.

"TenderLand views this possible situation as unfair to ratepayers who have
benefited by deregulation and exercised their right to choose, or plan to
choose an alternative electric service provider," said TenderLand Chief
Financial Officer Ken Keddington. "TenderLand is committed to taking all
possible action to protect its customers from these possible additional
costs while providing a renewable energy option."

"When California electricity customers choose TenderLand to receive
renewable power at a true flat electric generation rate, they will also join
TenderLand's crusade against passing added costs to those who want to opt
out of the statewide electric rate crisis, especially noticeable in San
Diego, by switching to alternative electric service providers."

The flat rate offer is limited to the first 60,000 new residential and
commercial customers who sign up with TenderLand. For more information, call
toll free at: 877/872-0932, or sign up on TenderLand's website at
www.TenderLand.com.

TenderLand Power Company, Inc. provides its customers with 100% renewable
power and is committed to furthering the development of new renewable
generation nationwide. The company is headquartered in Truckee, Calif.,
began retail operations in April 1999, and serves customers throughout most
of California.
