I don't believe that Jeff would be interested in meeting with this company.  
Please advise.

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff,

Here is some additional information on us that it was recommended I send to
you.  I am assisitant to Mark Kearns, Vice-President for Rutherford
Consulting, who resides in Houston.  When he is in town, I set up short
meetings for him of 30 minutes or so duration with companies and/or CEO's,
Presidents, etc. that he would like to bring industry informaiton to as
well as a bit more about us.

I will call after you've had the opportunity to review this to arrange a
convenient time for you both.
