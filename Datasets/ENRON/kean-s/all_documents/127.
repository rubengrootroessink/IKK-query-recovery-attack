Dear Mr. Kean:

I would like to thank you and Mark Schroeder very much for your time and
outstanding hospitality in Houston.  I very much enjoyed meeting with you
and your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with
our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and
looking forward to November 30.

However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the
dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. Wil=
l
Enron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gathering
of 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kind
as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=
t
point, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.

An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=
e
that a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider
audience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=
n
Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it
unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.
Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston
Partnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=
y
assistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not take
too many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea of
promoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan for
Houston (see attached doc).

I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the
press-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possible
convenience.

Yours Sincerely
