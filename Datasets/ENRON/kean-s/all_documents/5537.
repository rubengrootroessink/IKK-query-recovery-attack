I managed to contact Sean this morning.  He also confirmed dinner at 
Brennan's.  He didn't really have a reason for waiting except to see what 
other offers came in.  He's shopping us.  He did say he was leaning toward 
Enron, though.  I answered some questions he had concerning what his day to 
day duties might consist of and how much input he would have in his summer 
placement.  I also suggested he get in touch with Morela and talk to her 
about her summer experience.

I spoke with Philip today and he is confirmed for dinner at Brennan's.  He is 
holding back on commiting to Enron mainly to preserve his geographic 
options.  He indicated that Enron was definitely his first choice but for 
some personal considerations.  I think Philip was our strongest candidate and 
I would hate to lose him for these personal reasons.  I have an idea about 
how to 'fix' it and will pursue a solution and let you know.
