"team" positions in each relevant market.  I would like any feedback ASAP so 
I can get with Ed Baughman and finalize.

ERCOT - Ron McNamara (Lead); Robin Kittel 

SPP - Sarah Novosel (Lead); Ron McNamara [We need to replace Sarah Novosel 
within 3 months]

SERC - Joe Connor (Lead)

FRCC - Dan Staines (Lead); May Need another Person

MISO (ECAR/MAIN/MAPP) - Jeff Brown (Lead); Kerry Stroup, Janine Midgen

PJM - Tom Hoatson (Lead)

NY - Howard Fromer (Lead)

NEPOOL - Dan Allegretti (Lead)

Please let me know your thoughts.
