Hi Steve,

I thought it might be nice to send Korn/Ferry (Bob Laughman and Trigg 
Bracewell) a thank you note. I've attached a first draft of two letters (one 
for each). Feel free to make any changes. I'm happy to send out once you've 
reviewed, or if you prefer to have Maureen make changes and send out, I'd 
just like a copy.

Thanks.
Lisa
