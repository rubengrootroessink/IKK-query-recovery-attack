Subject: Another List

Attached is the list compiled by Marathon of "influentials" in each of our 
priority legislative districts (this week, we're only focusing on Burton, 
Bowen, Hertzberg, Keeley and Cox).  Please review the list and let me know 
ASAP if you know anyone on the list and would be willing to make calls.  
Thanks. kd
