Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation:  
consider having some or all of these individuals as "guest speakers" rather 
than formal memebers.  You can still have them review information, do their 
homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics.
Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the 
Future.  He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.

		 Subject: External Advisory Council

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting, one 
activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council.  
This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social 
issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, 
to advise us on trends and issues in this area.  An outline of the advisory 
council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is 
attached below.

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the 
Enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate 
Responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.  We plan to present a 
slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, 
and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.

Thanks for your consideration.
