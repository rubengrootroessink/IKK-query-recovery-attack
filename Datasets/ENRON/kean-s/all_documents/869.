Subject: Joe Hirko farewell reception



As you are aware, Joe Hirko has announced that he will be leaving Enron.  Joe 
will be in Houston next week, and we want to offer him our best wishes and 
give him a proper send-off.

Please drop by the Energizer on Tuesday,  August 1 any time between 2:30 and 
4:00 p.m. for an open house in honor of Joe.

Hope to see you there!
