Ginger - please forward this to all of GA.  Thanks.

This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA.  I am preparing Enron's 
comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning the results of different 
"regulatory approaches" by states implementing retail electric competition 
programs or legislation.  The FTC has invited comments on a number of 
specific issues, but their goal is to "examine various state retail 
competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in 
consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits."  

There are some obvious areas where we'll comment - California - but I'd 
appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory 
policies in other states.   Also, does anyone know of any good reports or 
analyses already prepared on these issues?   Thanks.  -Bob
