Steven,
I have not spoken to you in a while!
How are things going?

I have a question for you.
I am enrolled in a Corporate Crisis MGMT class at Rice, and my assignment 
for the up-coming Tuesday is to evaluate the crisis system (if there is one) 
at Enron.
Do you happen to know anything about Crisis Management in our company?

Let me know at your earliest convenience..

Jason Sokolov
