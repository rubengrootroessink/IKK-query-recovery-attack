FYI -- this is the latest initiative by the Administration to address MTBE 
concerns in this election year.   Directing resources toward cleanup and 
leaking tanks are measures that the MTBE industry has been advocating with 
the Administration and Congress.  Particularly given the current debate over 
high gasoline prices and RFG's possible role, it has been evident over the 
past few weeks that the White House and Congress have become less interested 
in tinkering with the RFG program and more interested in achievable, 
near-term efforts such as this.

EPA TAKES ACTION TO ADDRESS MTBE CONTAMINATION
FOR RELEASE:  THURSDAY, JULY 6, 2000

EPA TAKES ACTION TO ADDRESS MTBE CONTAMINATION

EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner today announced that the Clinton-
Gore Administration will fund two $1 million pilot projects, one each
in New York and California, to assist with the cleanup of the gasoline
additive MTBE in contaminated community water supplies.  Areas of Long
Island, N.Y., and Santa Monica, Calif., are among those communities
most affected by  MTBE contamination.
     "To protect public health and the environment, the Clinton-Gore
Administration has called on Congress to eliminate MTBE from gasoline,
and we've begun regulatory action aimed at phasing it out," said
Browner.  "However, in the meantime, action must be taken to help
communities already affected by MTBE leaks.  Today, we are providing
additional funding to help New York and California remove MTBE
contamination in affected communities and prevent future problems from
leaking tanks."

     New York is being awarded $1 million to accelerate cleanup at 50
MTBE contaminated sites on Long Island.  The funds for Santa Monica,
Calif. will be used to help the state and the city with the cleanup of
MTBE contaminated groundwater.

     MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is an additive in gasoline
used by many refiners to meet a provision of the Clean Air Act that
calls for the use of oxygenates in fuels.  In 1999, the Clinton-Gore
Administration convened a Blue-Ribbon Panel to investigate if MTBE
posed special risks to water supplies.  In the Fall of 1999, the Panel
presented scientific proof confirming that MTBE threatens water
supplies.  The Administration subsequently called on Congress to phase
down or eliminate MTBE.  The Administration also has begun regulatory
action to control MTBE under the Toxics Substances Control Act.
