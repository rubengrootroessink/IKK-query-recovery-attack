Mark, I had O&M do a little research on how much we spent in 99 and the 
numbers aren't that far off the numbers that were noted on us, which leads me 
to believe the competitors numbers a little more. Look at the spreadsheet 
below.  While our Corp spending was small, over we spent almost $800,000 as 
Enron in whole and that is probably what they were noting.  (I subtracted 
Axurix out -  that is why the number dropped from 1.1 Million). 


Margaret,

Per our conversation last week, attached is a chart for that outlines Enron's
spending in 1999.  The total is $1,175.8M net.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or require any
additional information.


Cordially,

Have a hard time with the source of these numbers if they think we're doing 
$850K in print.  What's the source?
