SK - I printed this & put it & attachments in your meeting folder.  mm

Alan Comnes will fax to your attention the EIA reports on Wyoming.  Susan 
Landwehr has faxed to you Gov. Geringer's statement before Congress and other 
pertinent materials.  We are searching for a recent presentations by Belden 
in Santa Fe.  Attached is a presentation Tim made re:  power supply that is 
somewhat out of date--note date of 8/14/00.  



Sue Landwehr will also prepare a briefing paper for you on the Gov. including 
a summary of the positions he has taken recently at WGA and RGA functions.  

Attached is a presentation prepared by Steve Walton on transmission 
activities in the West.  While I did not present Steve's slides, I used them 
as an ouline for remarks I made at the last WGA meeting on transmission.  
Gov. Geringer participated in the meeting and appeared to agree with our 
approach for adding transmission in congested areas.



I've also attached a copy of a presentation put together by Jeff Dasovich on 
energy needs of the high tech industry.  He prepared these at your request 
last fall.  






Have a good weekend.
