I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.  For example, how much of 
the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?  He wants to make the 
point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly 
progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.
