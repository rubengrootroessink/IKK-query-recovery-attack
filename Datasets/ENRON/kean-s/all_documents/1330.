Dear Colleague,
On September 25, Senator Murkowski will be addressing this year's US

Conference will offer unique insights on 5 market segments:
 Jim Sweeney, Stanford University, is chairing a half-day program on
new transportation technologies and their implications for vehicle producers
and fuel producers.
 Steve Warwick, Koch Energy, is chairing a half-day program on
optimizing profitability in the fuel & power generation market.
 Steve Connors, MIT,  is chairing a half-day program on exploiting
the opportunities that are unfolding as the electric industry moves from
Ratebase to Revenues.
 Louise Burke, NYMEX, is hosting a half-day program on the expansion
of financial market instruments as a risk management tool in the power
industry.
 Peter Davies, BP/Amoco, has invited notable energy industry speakers
to discuss global developments in energy markets.
These programs will bring leaders of the energy market together to discuss
the dramatic transformation of the industry -- and how to profit from them.
Please register today for the US Association for Energy Economics Conference
to be held Sept. 25-27 in Philadelphia. We look forward to seeing you at the
