>  AL GORE'S JOURNEY A Boyhood Divided
>  A Boy's Life In and Out of the Family Script
>  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER
>  The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
> died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: "Son, always
> do right. Always do right." His father, the senator, felt he had
> himself done right a lot of the time, and reliably kept after his son
> to follow suit.
>  After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
> though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights
> straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on
> a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the
> benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books. This time, nobody
> came right out and accused Mr. Gore himself of tweaking the dialogue.
>  Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now
> widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
> strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
> and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
>  That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
> vice president.
>  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is
> a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark is now
> fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once
> dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove
> it. Had anyone ever heard that story before?
>  The questions are about more than Mr. Gore's assertions about
> the Internet and "Love Story." What in his life was scripted and what
> was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
> hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing out
> hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
>  But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Mr. Gore's
> life, perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
> material that is the most widely doubted is also the most demonstrably
> true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in Tennessee. He did work
> hard on the farm there -- so hard, in fact, that the hired help felt
> sorry for him, and thought his father should ease up.
>  In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Mr.
> Gore's life is not true: he did not, for example, live in luxury back
> in Washington during the school year.
>  Mr. Gore's parents were both famously frugal and were not well
> off until after their son had grown and after the senator's political
> career had ended. Though they sent their children to exclusive schools
> and provided such social necessities as ballroom dancing lessons for
> their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's hand-me-downs and lived
> in a hotel because it was owned by a relative who gave them a break on
> the rent.
>  Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
> put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
> they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
> Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
> years.
>  Part of the reason that the contours of Mr. Gore's unusual
> upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
> worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
> childhood -- the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him the
> most good politically. The problem, for him, is the scenes from the
> past that portray Mr. Gore sympathetically at the expense of his
> hard-driving parents.
>  They suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the
> weight of enormous adult expectations, and Mr. Gore, who is fiercely
> protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory of his father,
> categorically balks at that.
>  For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988
> presidential campaign and his son's near-fatal car accident the next
> year, Mr. Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of his
> own life story.
>  He made a serious study of family dysfunction -- the subtext of
> his 1992 environmental manifesto, "Earth in the Balance" -- and passed
> out copies of Alice Miller's "Drama of the Gifted Child," a book about
> how narcissistic parents can leave their high-achieving children cut
> off from their own feelings and hazy on just what they want, other
> than to make Mom and Dad proud. Back then, friends said, he was
> absorbed by the need to figure things out, to emerge from his father's
> shadow. To decide.
>  But today, Mr. Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want
> to be president, and if he can never really know exactly how much of
> that want began with his parents, his current attitude seems to be: So
> what? "One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows
> parent," he said recently, with what sure seemed like authentic
> boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very
> difficult.
>  In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and
> appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood in
> which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of continuing
> political calculations -- maybe the same way writers often end up
> milking their families for material. When he got in trouble for
> throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore farm when he was
> 12, for example, his father made him send letters of apology to a
> number of trucking companies. "That was also an election year, I
> believe," he remarked wryly. But, he made clear, it was also just a
> kid's life.
>  From the Farm and the City
>  "I was conceived in Tennessee," Mr. Gore began, drawling for
> effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
> biographical exercise.
>  Though his political opponents have successfully portrayed him
> as a pure-bred Washington creature, with only photo-op moments in the
> heartland, he did have a life there, on the family farm, and by all
> accounts a more intense emotional connection to that place than to the
> nation's capital.
>  His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
> time with adults -- important adults, in whose presence he was
> expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
> least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
>  His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
> small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where the
> Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. "There were not a
> lot of kids around the Fairfax," the Embassy Row hotel where the Gores
> lived while in Washington, "so he could not wait to get back home,"
> said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest childhood friend, and a good
> pal still.
>  "I went up there" when Mr. Gore was in high school "and the
> friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop," Mr. Armistead said.
> "There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There was a
> dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around Washington much
> when he could have been in Carthage, and that's where he got his
> values, working on the farm and growing up around Smith County
> people."
>  Of course, Mr. Gore is the product of both Washington and
> Tennessee -- and of the very fact of having grown up in two places,
> with two groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He
> was born in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1
> until he was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved
> between the two places until college.
>  This back and forth set him slightly apart from those around
> him, in season and out, and made him tough to figure.
>  Even his sense of humor is a hybrid, a little bit corny with
> flashes of sarcasm.
>  Mr. Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
> world was a gift, at least in the end.
>  "Even though I spent more time each year in Washington,
> Tennessee was home," he said. "Now I'm sure that part of that was me,
> as a kid, absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of
> their lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
> sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than that."
>
>  He described Tennessee as a place where "the human relationships
> were much warmer," and where he had his dearest friends.
>  "I think I learned a great deal from the, forgive the word, the
> parallactic view provided by growing up in two places," he says now,
> "because just as having two eyes gives you depth perception, having
> two homes allows you to see some things that stand out in relief when
> viewed from two different perspectives."
>  A Tennessee Work Ethic
>  Mr. Gore's father -- who also favored fancy words -- moved
> between two worlds, too, and for all his striving in Washington did
> not believe in leaving either Tennessee or his farm roots behind,
> ever, even after his career in politics ended.
>  And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be
> good for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be
> president one day. "It was expected from the time he was little," said
> James Fleming, a Nashville doctor and friend of Nancy Gore's, who for
> a time served as the Gore family physician. It was not so much that
> the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add just the right touch of
> "log cabin" to his r,sum,, family friends said, as that they simply
> felt it would toughen him up and give him a proper work ethic.
>  "His daddy used to get him up about 6 o'clock in the morning,"
> said Mattie Lucie Payne, who worked for the Gores as a housekeeper for
> more than 40 years. "And Al would say, 'Daddy, we have men working,'
> and his daddy would say, 'I know, and you go on down and help them.' "
>
>  He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
> the hired help.
>  But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning his son some
> of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly acres with a
> hand ax.
>  "He'd drive him pretty hard," said Gordon Thompson, a friend
> whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own father
> worked for the senator.
>  But then, he drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as a
> 9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
> usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. "He was the only camper I
> ever had volunteer for K-P," said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H agent.
>  For several weeks every summer after school let out, but before
> his parents could get away from Washington, Mr. Thompson said, Al
> would stay with them in a house with no indoor plumbing. "He never
> complained," Mr. Thompson said. "I think he was always happiest on the
> farm."
>  Always, he was serious. "He pretty much acted the same way when
> he was 13 as he does now," said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
> sister and Mr. Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
> beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she was
> 16.
>  "He was a terrific listener," recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
> nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
> would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
> store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
> stretches several times a week.
>  Mr. Gore's own mother "was not very touchy," Ms. Armistead said,
> adding, "When he came in she just wouldn't come running to hug him."
>  She said his father used an entirely different voice when he
> talked with Al.
>  "He'd talk with authority," she said.
>  And nobody, the way Ms. Armistead remembers it, gave him any
> breaks for being a senator's son.
>  Once, after Mr. Gore and Ms. Armistead had done a particularly
> hard job on the farm, the senator told him to take her out for a meal
> at a certain cafe. "We were so thrilled," she remembered. "But after
> dinner Al gets up to the cash register and said, 'My dad said to
> charge it to him,' and the guy wouldn't do it."
>  The senator's tab was too long already.
>  "So I had to tell him I'd be right back, and go get the money
> from my mom," Ms. Armistead said.
>  A Touch of Mischief
>  Still, his time in Tennessee was not all boot camp and character
> building, and Mr. Gore did manage to have some unscripted fun. Mr.
> Thompson remembers his friend as "pranky," with a love of practical
> jokes that endures today.
>  One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole
> group was snowed in at the Gore farm, so Pauline Gore corralled all
> the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the
> lower level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty at
> the top of the stairs all night long, and every so often yelled
> downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one
> bottle of beer.
>  At first light, Ms. Armistead heard a knock on the window,
> looked out and saw Al and his buddies, who had slipped out a window
> and climbed up onto the deck outside her room, where they were making
> snowmen in their underwear for the girls' benefit.
>  "Mr. Albert still thought he had everything under control," she
> said.
>  Her brother, Steve, describes a pretty mild teenage rebellion:
> "We did all the experimental things kids do. We'd sneak out at night
> and pick up Coke bottles off a front porch that probably were not
> ours, or go to the lake and maybe do a little water skiing at night
> that was not too smart, and occasionally have a party. We probably did
> a little bit of alcohol abuse."
>  But there were also times, even as a kid, when Mr. Gore flouted
> authority more directly. Once, while staying with the Thompsons, he
> heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a speech
> in Nashville, 55 miles east.
>  His parents, though, had decided that their son should not come
> to the event.
>  "He was little," 12 at most, Mr. Thompson said, "but Al went
> over to Carthage and caught the bus and went down there, still dressed
> for the farm. That didn't go over too well. His mom called and wanted
> to know where he was -- that was a biggie. My mom had to tell her he
> wasn't here. Today, you'd be worried about all kinds of things
> happening. But they were more concerned about him not being all
> cleaned up."
>  Like a lot of mothers, Pauline Gore always insisted publicly
> that her son was at all times the perfect boy.
>  But was she embellishing a little? At least at times, she
> apparently thought she had reason to worry.
>  Dr. Fleming said, "I remember Donna, this good-looking girl,
> running around the house, and Pauline saying, 'Ohmigod, she's going to
> get pregnant, I know it.' "
>  Mr. Gore was not shy about expressing affection for his
> girlfriend in front of his mother.
>  "I remember Pauline and I drove him to the airport one time,"
> said Ms. Armistead, "and he kissed her on the cheek and then he kissed
> me. I mean, he laid one on me, honey." 
>  Ms. Armistead says the two of them were lectured. "Miss Pauline
> said keep busy, don't think about sex, enjoy your time together but
> always have something in mind to do," she said. "Cold showers and lots
> of exercise."
>  But she also says Mrs. Gore need not have worried. "Sex was sex
> even then," Ms. Armistead said, "but Al and I both had goals."
>  Finding a Role Model
>  Today, the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the
> benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in Tennessee
> -- skinny-dipping with Mr. Thompson in a cattle trough or hypnotizing
> chickens, which Mr. Gore says is "a little-known farm skill passed
> down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard."
>  Mr. Gore also situates himself politically in Tennessee, as heir
> not only to his father but to Cordell Hull, whom he describes as "the
> model for public service in our part of the country." Mr. Hull floated
> logs down the Cumberland River with Mr. Gore's grandfather, settled in
> Carthage and became the congressman in the seat the Gore father and
> son later held.
>  An ardent free-trader, Mr. Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize for
> his role in founding GATT, now the World Trade Organization, and was
> secretary of state in World War II. "But before that he was a judge on
> the circuit, and in 10 counties there, the picture above the judge's
> chair in the courtroom is neither George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
> nor Franklin Roosevelt," Mr. Gore said, with the greatest possible
> reverence. "It's Cordell Hull to this day."
>  Asked to name the most important things he had inherited from
> his parents, Mr. Gore talked for a long time about his father and his
> father's ideals. But the first thing he said in answer to the question
> was this:
>  "Some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality I
> sometimes lapse into comes in part from my father's habit of trying to
> ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live up to
> the position he felt deserved dignity.
>  "People who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find
> that ironic because they don't remember the formal bearing that he had
> in most of his appearances. He had a capacity to enjoy humor and music
> and friendship, and he also felt the need to present himself as a
> senator in a formal and dignified way."
>  Those who knew the senator say his climb from poverty was still
> too fresh and stereotypes of Tennessee hillbillies with dirt under
> their fingernails still too prevalent for him to feel he could afford
> the luxury of letting his guard down in certain public settings.
>  His father "always raised cattle, he always farmed, he always
> found relaxation, even in Washington, by going to the farm and working
> with cattle," the vice president said.
>  "But he became a statesman," too, Mr. Gore said. "I've often
> thought in my father's persona he continued to manifest both."
>  His friends feel sure Mr. Gore would move back to Carthage if,
> as Mr. Thompson delicately put it, "worse comes to worst." The vice
> president laughed at that, but agreed. "Well, I'll retire in Carthage
> for sure," he said. "You know, I hope that's many years from now."
>  One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
> though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
> never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to wear
> any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for him --
> T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St. Albans.
>  "He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like he
> was better than the rest of us," guessed his old friend Edward Blair.
>  But Mr. Gore, who had his boots up on the table in front of him
> as he talked, snorted when he heard this.
>  "I guess maybe they were thinking that Washington is such a neat
> place," he said, "that I would naturally want to tell them all about
> the great things there."
>  Few Comforts of Home
>  If the Fairfax was a cold place to grow up, it was not because
> there was no family close by.
>  The owner, Grady Gore, was a cousin of the senator's. Louise
> Gore, one of Grady's daughters, lived in the hotel. Her sister, Mary
> Gore Dean, moved in, too, after her husband died in a plane crash. For
> a while, their brother Jimmy Gore and his family were on the premises,
> as well. When they moved, it was just down the block.
>  But the vice president is not sentimental about his time there.
> "I came to love the farm," he said. "The hotel I never loved."
>  The senator's correspondence makes clear that he and his family
> were there because the price was right. The Gores looked for a house
> in Washington for years, but never found anything they felt they could
> afford.
>  And one thing that seems to bother Mr. Gore -- far more, in
> fact, than the idea that his 52 years add up to something that is not
> so much a life as a story line -- is the perception that "I was in
> this luxury apartment eating room service, sort of like Eloise."
>  Asked if his younger days in Washington were lonely, he sighed.
>  "Oh, no," he said. "I mean I had good friends and I had my
> sister. And it's not as if I didn't have my parents. They went out
> frequently, and every six years they had a hard campaign, but they
> were great and loving parents, and the times when they were pulled
> away I had Nancy and my friends. I wasn't left alone with my
> thoughts."
>  He got pretty creative about making his own fun, sometimes
> upending all the furniture in the living room to construct an
> elaborate fort. But activity was supposed to be purposeful. "His dad
> was a very, very proud man and believed that old Cordell Hull thing of
> you're put on earth for a purpose and it's to improve the condition of
> life," said Mr. Gore's cousin, Mark Gore, who lived down the block.
>  (His cousin also remembers Senator Gore teaching him to swim by
> throwing him into a pool when he was 4, while Al, who was 7, looked
> on, laughing.)
>  From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
> Episcopal boys' prep school on the grounds of the National Cathedral,
> where he did well but was not, according to friends, especially happy.
>
>  Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee girlfriend, Ms.
> Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay phone every Saturday
> night.
>  Two of Mr. Gore's closest Washington friends recall that while
> Al Gore was the focus of his parents' fondest hopes, it was his
> free-spirited, rebellious sister, Nancy, who took more of their
> energy. "The general topic of conversation over there was what
> outrageous thing Nancy did this week," said one of these friends. "She
> got a lot of attention and Al was kind of an afterthought, because he
> never misbehaved."
>  For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around
> with his father at Grady Gore's estate in Potomac, Md. "He had some
> cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there," Mr. Gore said,
> smirking like he knows that sounds kind of crazy. "And a lot of times
> on weekends we'd go up there and he'd work with the cattle and I'd
> help him and then we'd take a break." Sometimes, too, they played
> catch in the Russell building, outside the senator's office, though if
> someone walked by, "he'd duck back into the office until they passed"
> because "it wasn't very dignified," the son recalled. When Al Gore had
> real ballgames, though, it was his sister, not his father, who would
> come.
>  More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat
> through long stretches of discussion over the bill, co-sponsored by
> his father, that created the Interstate System of highways. How wide
> would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a kid,
> Mr. Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the
> miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the
> Yankees' box scores.
>  "He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't
> supposed to," Mr. Gore remembered. And one day, when Al was 5, he was
> invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard M. Nixon,
> who was presiding that day: "He put me on his knee and was very nice
> to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of the more
> sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred."
>  Once, Mr. Gore's father let his son listen in on an extension
> while he spoke to President John F. Kennedy, who at the time was
> furious at a certain steel executive for raising prices after the
> steel workers had agreed not to seek a wage increase. "The family
> anecdote that my father always told after that -- like a lot of family
> anecdotes I can't really vouch for -- but he said that I said, 'Dad, I
> didn't know presidents talked that way.' "
>  The vice president does have strong memories of Kennedy, though.
>
>  "I was blown away by his inaugural address," he said. I remember
> so vividly the thick snow on the seats, and listening to each word
> bring out such poetic force. Really, it was a remarkable time. My
> sister was one of the first volunteers for the Peace Corps that month,
> and the whole family was filled with the excitement of the New
> Frontier."
>  They all wanted, each in their own way, to be part of that
> excitement. And the entire family talked a lot about not just the
> bills before Congress but the big issues of the day, especially civil
> rights. In these discussions, was his mother more liberal than his
> father, as some who knew the couple have suggested? "Mmmmm, my dad was
> pretty liberal," Mr. Gore answered. "She was, like most moms, the
> conscience of the family, but they didn't really disagree. And my
> sister was more liberal than both of them put together."
>  Then Mr. Gore started to laugh, and kept on for a good long
> time. "It was a family of many consciences," he said.
