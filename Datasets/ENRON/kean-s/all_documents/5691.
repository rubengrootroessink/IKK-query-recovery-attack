Philippe Bibi =01) 2/28/01
After PW reviewed a number of portal applications, Philippe said they were=
=20
good but not difficult.  He requested to see transaction process and single=
=20
sign on applications.  PW showed Philippe their Travel application.  PW=20
emphasized this was the only way employees could schedule travel. =20
Previously, employees would call the 800 number and incur a ~$100.00 charge=
. =20
The online portal applications reduced the charge to $12.00.

PW emphasized Chrysler was spending $200.00 million per year in training. =
=20
The portal provided a skills inventory application which resulted in reduci=
ng=20
the training expenditures down to $100 million per year.  Philippe could se=
e=20
how this would be of value in a blue-collar environment but could not see t=
he=20
value in our environment.=20

Philippe asked PW if they could demonstrate an application which was not=20
something shrink wrapped off the shelf.  PW showed him their stock option=
=20
application and the training application. =20

PW emphasized HP had 83 autonomous Business Units which needed to be united=
=20
under this portal.  Every day 90% of HP global employees access the portal.=
 =20
Why?  The portal is the only way to access a number of job related=20
applications. =20

Philippe asked about ad hoc reports.  He said Enron has a problem getting a=
d=20
hoc reports.  He said canned reports are not very useful.  Further, he cann=
ot=20
get a quick ad hoc report of all the consultants currently billing and at=
=20
what expense. =20

Philippe said the ability to get in to SAP is a drawback.  How did HP addre=
ss=20
applications that were not web enabled?  Content management tools like iCli=
ck=20
and interwoven were used as delivery mechanisms for making enhanced=20
applications available via the web.

Philippe said this is a vehicle to pull together travel, ibuyit, Paine=20
Webber, Benefits, facilities, aviation, conference/video calls.  What about=
=20
the guy who is doing trading, logistics, settlements, transactions with the=
=20
pipelines?  Could this portal provide for that person?  Philippe sees the=
=20
only benefit for this person would be the single sign on. =20

Philippe said, =01&Let me stress three things:  1)  we have a series of=20
initiatives click@home, IM Task Force, Data Repository 2)  Enron is not tha=
t=20
disciplined.  We don=01,t want to get in the middle of policing publication=
 of=20
information over the web (Per Clay, Interwoven allows other BU/Fus to=20
publish), 3)  From an infrastructure perspective, the number of servers we=
=20
run as far as web servers, we run them clustered.=018

This portal initiative must be justified not on savings, but on=20
functionality.  Savings is zero value.  Soft savings are impossible to=20

er a=20
cost analysis. =20

Use PW as the catalyst.

Philippe said we would need processes around security.  Philippe would like=
=20
to understand how HP did this.  Philippe would like to see how to gap the=
=20
bridges.  He is in favor of taking customer applications and making them=20
available from a single sign on. =20

Philippe recommended Allan Sommer, George Wasaff and Marie Hejka get togeth=
er=20
and come up with about 80% of the cost analysis information which otherwise=
=20
might have been developed during the two day workshop.  Philippe recommends=

stopping other projects and focusing on this project.=20

Rick see a few hurdles 1) getting buy in from all the companies 2) getting=

buy in from Jeff Skilling 3) getting buy in from the technical side. =20

Also, noted is that Carly stopped 30 plus projects of web development to=20

The portal should include a forced information space to introduce new porta=
