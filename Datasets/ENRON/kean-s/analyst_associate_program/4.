Steve the comment compilation is a laundry list.  I think that some of them=
 are completely out of sync and unjustified but others are real and many re=
peat themselves.  Many of the comments are with respect to salary.  There i=
s also the theory that only the unhappy or bitter or unsuccessful take the =
time to answer.  The happy ones might just have passed on this one. =20

I hope you find them relevant and/or useful. =20

I was told that William Lemons of the associate program saw this list a cou=
ple of months ago and reacted positively.  A raise is being studied for cur=
rent associates and the offers were higher for this year ?s summer associat=
es.

Best,

Ricardo

The comments are below.  They are also in the attached word document below.=
  Thank you to the people who took the time and energy to step up and respo=

Everyone is not going to agree with all the comments but Billy is going to =

Comments from MBA Class 2000

1.=09We need to reconcile the difference between ENE's salaries vs competit=
ors' and other Houston companies.

2.=09We need better guidance in the rotation selection (I've seen lot of go=
od people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of =
information).

3.=09Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not, the Program itsel=
f is staffed in a very amateur manner.  There are a few really good people =
but for the most part it is just not professionally run.  Calls unanswered,=
 lots of passing the buck, and general disorganization.

4.=09If they have resources, they do a poor job of communicating them.  Whi=
le we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves, there should be an a=
ctive effort to point us to those resources.

5.=09Compensation.  The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being l=
ocked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance.  At =
the very least, this is a serious oversight. =20

6.=09PRC.  Really doesn't work.  Not an apple to apples comparison.  Heavil=
y dependent on when/where you rotated.

7.=09I could care less about Enron's reputation.  I tried paying my student=
 loans with "reputation" but they only accepted cash.  How much money can I=
 make at this place assuming the stock price doesn't double every few month=
s, in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay=
 my compensation? =20

8.=09Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term=
s of the PRC, where before Enron was penalizing the "have issues" classific=
ation of the PRC, now it feels like they are trying to get rid of 20% of th=
e pool. Reinforcing the first paragraph.

9.=09Offer of salary is cloaked and we don't know where we can end up.

10.=09I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h=
ead office. As a result, the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e=
xpectations. And obviously when those expectations are not met, we all know=
 the consequences.

11.=09The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much high=
er base

12.=09Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against?  I=
s it really Wall Street and consulting?  If so, I'd like to see the names o=
f the firms.  New York is not that expensive that the "well they're in New =
York" excuse covers all discrepancies.  It feels like we must be benchmarki=
ng against second or third tier MBA recruiters.

13.=09There's a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a s=
ecure, established, money making division in order to guarantee a average o=
r above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom =
brackets and not be fired.  That goes against the long- term reputation of =
Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks.=20

14.=09Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro=
tating but do not expect to get displaced by a 1st rotation associate that =
is placed by the AA pool.

15.=09Assignment of 1st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was=
 more of an analyst function than it was an associate function.  Why can't =
alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the=
 in coming candidate?

16.=09Manage expectations...don't need to hear about 26 year old trader and=
 Louise Kitchen's rise to fame with Enron Online...creates an expectation t=
hat those are more common occurrences than they really are.

17.=09It doesn't feel like there's a lot to do in all areas, nonetheless so=
mething between 60 and 100 new associates coming in these fall: First, why =
that many?  Second, do they know what they are getting into?

18.=09The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market =
- we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up =
for the disparity, but given the declining stock value, lack of meaningful =
rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra=
m this is becoming a much bigger issue.

19.=09Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea wha=
t the upside looks like.  Working for beans in year 1 is ok if years 2-5 ar=
e excellent.  We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft=
er the program is over.

20.=09Salary well below market (base salary and value of options/bonus) - e=
ven if they bring us up to the 2001 offers (which are rumored to be under m=
arket), we have 1 year or more experience with the class coming in and will=
 be paid the same amount?

21.=09Lack of quality rotations (cuts in EBS, EES, ect...)

22.=09Level of responsibility is well below expectations/maturity level

23.=09Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top=
 B-Schools.  Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting, but also compared=
 to specialties (brand management, etc.) that are at the lower end of the M=
BA scale.  It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not i=
ndexed by location.  Other energy companies here in town even pay more. =20

24.=09The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no=
t carrots.  There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of=
 a signing bonus 18 months after the start date.  If the Program is truly s=
pecial people should not be forced to repay anything-Enron should deliver w=
hat they advertise and people will stay.  The 18-month lock up period sugge=
sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associ=
ate and not an improvement in the Program.=20

25.=09How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe=
rformance levels?  I've got no clue but I'm wondering why it such a big sec=
ret?=20

26.=09The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota=
tions as Enron implies.  For example, if you take a rotation in an area you=
 know nothing about, you will lose in the PRC because you are still learnin=
g the job.  Similarly, if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation, y=
ou will be rewarded a PRC time.

27.=09There are too many associates and too few analysts.   Too many associ=
ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do.  Too often, asso=
ciates think to themselves, I remember doing this several years ago as an u=
ndergrad, why am I doing this again.

28.=09They should present the program for what it is -an internal labor poo=
l where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available =
and who they know.  The Program does not match people with jobs and should =
make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs, etc upon entry into t=
he program.  This is not because they want Associates to have choice, but r=
ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations=
. =20

29.=09If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting=
, we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors.  I don't k=
now what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not k=
eeping up.  Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra=
m.  When a person who didn't get into Enron but got into a competitor makes=
 materially more money from the start, people start believing they have jus=
t been sold a lot of hype.

30.=09Not enough development during rotations - even associates who end up =
learning a lot don't necessarily enjoy their rotations because they don't f=
eel part of the team

31.=09Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir=
st rotation is a moral buster as well.  Additionally, it can waste a lot of=
 time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have=
 no interest in.

32.=09Compensation - many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba=
se and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised l=
arge equity based compensation.  Also, it was very difficult to find out wh=
at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process.  Most wrongl=
y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth=
er leading MBA avenues.  How much money do people at Enron make assuming th=
e stock price performs1. Great 2. Okay, 3. Poor? =20

33.=09Responsibility - when you are getting recruited you always here the L=
ouise Kitchen, John Arnold, and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal.=
  We need to stop doing that.  Enron's slowing growth rate and failure in e=
verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we=
 look more and more like a large corporation. =20

34.=09The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let =
them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out.  I=
f this is true, why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f=
ewer, higher quality associates from the start - the process of weeding out=
 leaves everyone with a bad feeling.  More importantly, you probably lose m=
ore good people then you realize.

35.=09Trading, trading, trading.  On MBA campus visits, Enron gives the imp=
ression that there are lots of corporate development & M&A, finance, and ot=
her similar assignments available at Enron.  The reality seems that if you =
are not interested in trading for a living, you are not on the company's ma=
in commercial track any longer.

36.=09Finding a Rotation: Information difficult to get; it is all networkin=
g. This is fine, but I don't consider the A/A progrram a resource in this a=
rea at all. If no one else does, we should cut any expenses they are incurr=
ing for "rotation placement".

37.=09The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale.  You can reward the high =
performers without penalizing the good performers.  Recently, the word has =
gotten around =09that the top 5% and the next 15% of the PRC group got very=
 large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses?  This=
 distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb=
er of unhappy people.

38.=09"I find it interesting that Enron chooses to 1- adopt a business mode=
l based upon free-market economics, and 2- pride itself on its intellectual=
 capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv=
ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence.  In sel=
ecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point.  I find it paradoxical, h=
owever, that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc=
ribed as socialistic, and below market.  In a labor market where intellectu=
al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive =
advantage in the form of this asset, I can only believe that Enron is posit=
ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J. Aron, Morgan Stanl=
ey, Dynegy, El Paso, etc. decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on En=
ron is to higher this intellectual capital.  Without griping, I feel if not=
hing else, workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen=
ts we possess.  In our "sales pitch" we are told that Enron benchmarks pay =
against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street.  =
I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand=
le to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package, which leaves me bi=
tter that the sales pitch was shallow, fell short, or was deliberately misg=
uided.  Part of the problem, from an Associates perspective, stems from Enr=
on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery.  Like a company t=
hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market, punishment for such a s=
hortfall is swift and severe.  I truly believe Enron is setting itself up f=
or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly.

39.=09In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an=
d socialistic patronage, I have come to notice that more and more departmen=
ts are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the A=
ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months.  Fu=
rther, many desks, once happy with the performance of the Associate, ask fo=
r the "option" to retain the Associate.  However, no effort is made to comp=
ensate the Associate for essentially giving up the "optionality" embedded i=
n a rotational program.  In fact, many choosing to stay within a group have=
 made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time, they=
 have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o=
pting to join a unit full time.  By removing the ability of business units =
to promote a worker until conclusion of the 18-24 month period, hard workin=
g, good-fit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see=
m to be a natural fit for a full-time position, and the chance to alleviate=
 a significant source of discontent-COMPENSATION- which could be addressed =
through the immediate promotion to the Manager level.  By allowing for prom=
otion, Associates could earn enhanced compensation, and department heads co=
uld address hiring needs.  Rather, Associates leave a unit disgruntled, fee=
ling they are marking time in other units, potentially passing up an altern=
ative that may be of great interest.  Additionally, a number of Commercial =
units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are =
in their third or fourth rotation, so as to retain a "call option" on an em=
ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives.  This practice CANNOT be =
in the best interest of the Desks, the Program, or for that matter Enron.  =
By pigeonholing employees in this matter, the significance and importance o=
f rotations is greatly diminished, as is our work experience.  This is just=
 ludicrous!  Department heads aren't looking to hire externally because of =
the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade.  Rather, they are trying to =
plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary.  Again, rather than=
 pay a competitive, performance-based wage, Enron has adopted a tight-fiste=
d, socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses.  Ultimately, this will l=
ead to people seeking to "rotate" out of Enron for the compensation the mar=
ket will bare.  =20

40.=09I think A/A provides an excellent opportunity to find the department =
that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job, =
chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates, than for =
regular employees.

41.=09We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go - I doubt many=
 of the guys who went to NY had this.

42.=09We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce=
.

43.=09Salaries: Not in line with market.

44.=09Mentors: Not encouraged throughout the organization.=20

45.=09Recruiting: Disorganized, not enough student focus, trying to compete=
 with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries, sometimes unprofess=
ional conduct (rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and =
gave message 'you are not good enough').

46.=09Summer Intern Program: Not well coordinated.=20

47.=09Rotation Length: Keep flexibility. 6 mos sometimes too short (other t=
imes too long); disincents management to include Associates in longer term/=
meatier projects.

48.=09When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited?

49.=09Overall, Enron has a great group of people to work with.

50.=09Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds, ethnicity, and natio=
nalities within the company.

51.=09Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere

52.=09Overall, Enron has an excellent overall company image

53.=09I do not have too many comments. My main problem with the last team w=
as that they were extremely rigid - rigid start date, rigidity in assigning=
 groups, etc. Old group did one-way dialogues, they would not even listen. =
The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen - these are two thi=
ngs I feel are most important in running such program.

54.=09Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friend=
s that graduated with me from my business school.  They wanted (still want)=
 to work for Enron. I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res=
ponse (I believe she left Enron). I then contacted Patricia Payton. Several=
 emails, phone calls and still haven't heard from her. It's frustrating dea=
ling with the HR dept.

55.=09PRC is not a trusted mechanism.  Few people in the program understand=
 it fully, no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings, and no one bel=
ieves the results are truly equitable.  Politics appears to play as much of=
 a role as performance, if not more so, in determining rankings.  Further, =
groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r=
anked people.  For as much as individuals' success depends upon this rankin=
g, and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be, that policy=
 is incredibly inconsistent.

56.=09We are under market for compensation - everyone knows this, regardles=
s of what the program people say.  It is common knowledge that at least Rel=
iant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b=
onus.  The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin=
g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl=
at and was not well received (obviously).

57.=09Rotation placement service is not very useful.  The best way to find =
a good rotation remains through networking.

58.=09The experience, talent, and character of the associate pool continue =
to be excellent.

59.=09Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with =
virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing.  Comeraderie a=
mong the class is widespread and genuine.

60.=09The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A=
/A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d=
irection.


61.=09Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in=
ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea=
te new networks between individual associate classes.  Efforts by individua=
l associates to affect this have not been supported.

62.=09Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered, =
particularly as rotation time approaches.  This would facilitate informal d=
iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity.  Additionally it =
would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota=
tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers.

63.=09Compensation is clearly an issue.  Whether the compensation gap exist=
s in reality or it only exists in perception, there is a widespread belief =
that Enron is under-compensating associates relative to both other firms in=
 the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a=
re employed.  This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel=
y underwater options.  Base salary should be addressed.

64.=09Again, whether perception or reality, associates are concerned about =
selecting rotations in groups that are not making money.  The belief is tha=
t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units.  The=
refore, it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro=
up, regardless of the skill development it may offer.

65.=09The mandatory eighteen-month service period before eligibility for pr=
omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers.

66.=09What happened to the A/A publication?

67.=09There is no source available that provides a history of individual as=
sociates who have rotated through specific jobs.  It would be very benefici=
al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for first-hand =
information on business units of interest.

68.=09My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot=
 of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons=
ibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into t=
he group.  Once in, I know of several people including myself that get a wh=
ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations=
 prior to joining that group.  Furthermore, I believe that Associates get w=
ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr=
ee.  This is very frustrating because once your in, your in and you can't g=
et out for 6 months.  On top of that, you get PRC reviews based on work tha=
t was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assess=
ment can be made. =20

69.=09Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon=
e.  But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up=
front with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate.  In addition=
, it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very, very poorly by=
 their new groups.  This has not been the case for me, but I know people th=
at have voiced these thoughts and opinions - so I am speaking for them inca=
se they are too nervous to put it into writing.

70.=09That is about it.  I would like to see some education come out of the=
 Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron, as well as som=
e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations.

71.=09When Enron recruited us, it was so different from what it is now.  So=
 many diverse opportunities were out there.  Now, Enron is heading towards =
a pure trading house.  It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota=
tion out of trading.  But you don't need an MBA to be a trader!  In fact, A=
ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side, and we don't have an=
y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi=
ng side.  It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about "getting the n=
ext rotation at El Paso".

72.=09A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly, and=
 six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first, and =
then make meaningful contributions.  Some people think it is worthwhile to =
groom Associates, even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts, who are =
supposed to be there longer.  It is sometimes difficult for Associates to g=
et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us.

73.=09Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit=
ors.

74.=09The company's direction has changed drastically from the one I interv=
iewed for in November 2000, some of these strategies seem shortsighted and =
in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th=
e energy business in the long term; specifically:

75.=09The stated strategy of exiting all generation, exploration, and trans=
portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa=
ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street.  Also, with additional pl=
ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way, how can we expect =
to continue to grow and maintain our current market share?

76.=09Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures;=
 including Azurix, Enron International, Dabhol, EBS, and EES.  The failures=
 of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b=
een totally priced in to our stock price.  Bottom line; there does not appe=
ar to be any large areas of growth within the company.

77.=09Pay! When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from 25,0=
00 to 40,000 dollars more to do the same job; it doesn't make you feel very=
 intelligent to be working here.  Additionally, when I accepted this positi=
on I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and=
 what the determinants are of the annual bonus.  What I have heard through =
the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to beli=
eve during recruiting.  Not having any assistance and having attended a top=
 East coast school, I am almost $100,000 dollars in debt.  I was counting o=
n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck=
, but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I w=
orked as an engineer in manufacturing.

78.=09I don't see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analys=
ts and Associates. It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salari=
es, but it is also a waste of "years of experience" in the case of Associat=
es.  It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the P=
rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units. Be certai=
n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associ=
ate.

79.=09If you look at A/A as human capital, we at Enron are very long in bac=
kground, experience and knowledge. The A/A Program is "Regulation" using En=
ron terminology: from rotation assignments, to payments. I see pretty logic=
al the consequences: a lot of inefficiencies, waste of energy, the lack of =
objectivity, poor motivation or even frustration, in general performance is=
 far away from excellent. Add some flexibility to the Program: let the peop=
le choose their rotations and move without restrictions. Let them also nego=
tiate working conditions, salaries, and career path with the business unit.

80.=09PRC is unfair. I consider offensive writing in a maximum of 5 lines 6=
 months of accomplishments. I don't think a PRC Committee can better assess=
 the performance than the business unit. 360-degree evaluations, and peers =
review are ok.  Re-think the need of a committee and a ranking of A/A assig=
ned to so different business units.

81.=09I feel free to choose for a second rotation. I like the way you can a=
pproach a new business unit, introduce yourself, have an interview and gath=
ered information about the business and your position. Things may change af=
ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least 6 months. Keep allo=
wing people to search and move freely from HR.


82.=09Make staff more accountable.  Online based.  Much like the IT departm=
ent, where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure =
of with any comments.

83.=09Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Man=
ager.  Not communicated at all.

84.=09Tell people that their first rotations are assigned.  Also not commun=
icated.

85.=09I wish I had a PRC suggestion, but I need to think about it.

86.=09Don't insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money=
 but putting it in a bonus so you don't have to give us raises.  If you wan=
t to do that, give me the courtesy of being up front about it.

87.=09Some kind of database (maybe there is one that I don't know about) of=
 openings.  Would be pretty cool.

88.=09Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors - at the =
least so it is equal.

89.=09Make the development and support of associates a more important crite=
rion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents.  The commer=
cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely

90.=09Reduce the size of each incoming class - make the program special aga=
in.  Right now, I can't believe the broad spread in ability and experience =
in the associate class.  I guarantee the spread is not that high in other t=
op tier firms that hire MBAs.

91.=09With the smaller size, assign a lead commercial person to a group of =
5 associates.  The lead commercial person (a director or VP) would keep in =
touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the =
most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them

92.=09Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these =
groups know when they need a clerk, analyst, or associate.  Too often we tr=
eat analysts, clerks, and 30-year-old associates with 6-8 years of experien=
ce the same.  This happens way too much.

93.=09The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer =
to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they =
want to take and design a plan on how to get them there.
