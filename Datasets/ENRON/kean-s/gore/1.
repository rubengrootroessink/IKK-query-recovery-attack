I met with Sally Painter to discuss our Gore 2000 strategy.  From this 
meeting, Sally drafted the attached action plan with the following near-term 
action items:

1) She suggests that we draft 1-2 page issue briefs on our signature policy 
issues.  I suggested 4 policy areas on which Enron has unique experience:  
electricity deregulation, e-commerce (trading), energy services, and 
broadband.  We spoke about this at a DC staff meeting and we set a mid-June 
deadline for the completion of these papers...of course with input from all.

2) We have set June 13 as the date for the Enron business outreach dinner.  
We need to decide if we want to do it in DC or Houston.  We also need to 
decide if we want to bring in our colleagues from different companies or 
associations to attend this dinner.  Sally suggested we try to bring in 8-10 
senior executives from our industry(ies).  

3) We need to set a date to go to Gore 2000 in Nashville to meet the 
working-level policy staff.  I will ask our respective support staff to 
schedule this.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks - Chris
