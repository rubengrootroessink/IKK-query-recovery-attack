Enron Continues to Implode;=20
Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed?



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fell sharply in ope=
ning trade on Nov. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned it could be for=
ced to pay by next week $690 million in debt triggered by a credit downgrad=
e last week. The shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, to just over $7.0=
0 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the =
biggest loser by percentage change and the second-most active stock on the =
NYSE. As of early morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares were priced at $=
4.85, reportedly their lowest level in nearly 10 years.=20

Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespeare, "Oh, what a tangled web they weave whe=
n first they attempt to?" Wait, I better stop. When speaking about Enron, I=
 am not prepared to finish that sentence, at least at this point. Enron has=
 been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks, but at this junct=
ure an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation has y=
et to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the p=
art of the Houston trader. Enron itself has admitted that its financial rec=
ords from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon." =
Nevertheless, perception is reality and the perception currently in the ind=
ustry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following yea=
rs of skirting the truth. While negative perception continues to cause dama=
ge to Enron's stock, perhaps of more current interest are the developments =
that are more grounded in reality. We know Enron has just lowered its third=
-quarter earnings, faces a stiff payment of $690 million (due within a week=
, in fact) and has cast doubt over its 4Q earnings potential. The question =
of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a "material =
adverse change" in the eyes of Dynegy, which still aims to buy Enron but wi=
sely included an exit clause in its purchase contract. The other question i=
s, what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar? A termi=
nated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enron's a=
lready-weak credit standing, and it is unknown how the company could recove=
r from another blow to its reputation.=20

As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing "fall of Enron=
" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy's proposed acquisi=
tion of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the proposa=
l, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at www.scientech.com/rci <h=
ttp://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D987>). In the intere=
st of time, let me summarize what is happening at this moment. Dynegy rode =
in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9-billion offer ($10 a share=
) to buy the company, which at the time represented a steal of a price cons=
idering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share little more than a year=
 ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga.=
 In other words, the company had gone through a tumultuous year, hit its "r=
ock bottom" but still planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy,=
 Inc., its much-smaller rival.=20

The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fa=
ct interrupt the nuptials between the two companies. For starters, on Monda=
y (Nov. 19), Enron submitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (which was five day=
s late, by the way). In the report, Enron dropped what have turned out to b=
e several bombshells. First, Enron disclosed that, due to recent downgrades=
 of its credit rating by agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fi=
tch, it has to pay off or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes to a third part=
y with which it has a partnership, or face nearly $4 billion in additional =
payments. Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee =
the debt. Enron would not disclose who owns the note, but we know that the =
limited partnership includes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazilian natural ga=
s-company that Enron had planned to sell to raise about $250 million in cas=
h. Note that just last week, various credit services lowered Enron's senior=
 unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned that further down=
grades may occur, which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment. =
Reportedly, if Enron does not make the $690-million payment by Nov. 27, inv=
estors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for a=
n amount equal to the note payable. Enron is presently scrambling to establ=
ish a "mutually acceptable" amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue=
 payment on the debt. Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent paymen=
t of $690 million, Enron said that any further drop in its credit rating mi=
ght necessitate further payments of $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the=
 bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.=20

Also in the new SEC filing, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 cents a s=
hare to 87 cents. Enron originally reported a 3Q loss of $618 million, but =
has now raised that figure to $664 million. As a minor bright side, Enron d=
id increase reported earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny =
to 20 cents a share, attributed to adjustments made after the quarter's end=
. However, looking forward, Enron warned that continuing credit worries and=
 a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on =
fourth-quarter earnings. Enron also claims that, even still, the numbers co=
ntained in the 10-Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been =
reviewed by Arthur Andersen, the company's external auditor. Thus, further =
revision of the numbers could take place.=20

Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question about whether or no=
t Enron can pay the $690-million debt obligation. Enron apparently has secu=
red an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup =
in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing, Enron says that i=
s has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and n=
et collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron=
 has the cash on hand to make the $690-million payment if it is unable to r=
enegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC filing, Enron also inte=
nds to sell off $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing "belo=
w acceptable rates" and would use the proceeds to pay off debts, although t=
his money would probably not be immediately available.=20

Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that shou=
ld be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past i=
n such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently, =
this non-disclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addin=
g too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As has=
 been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inve=
stigation regarding potential conflict-of-issues involving its former CFO. =
News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is =
clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock.=20

As I said, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems =
will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends=
 on who you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about =
Enron's financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the questi=
on. Some say that the facts disclosed in the 10-Q report do not dramaticall=
y change Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisi=
tion and that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a knee-jerk respons=
e to the media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any =
potential impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money com=
ing in from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $69=
0-million payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is =
still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock pri=
ce, and the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the =
combined company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural =
gas and electricity.=20

In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agre=
ement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 32.5 percent, whic=
h weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition, if Enron follows=
 through with the $690-million payment next week or secures additional fina=
ncing to front this cost, both options alter the company's financial positi=
on from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could be construed as a =
"material adverse change."=20

Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the c=
ompany that Dynegy agreed to purchase. New reports indicate many energy tra=
ding companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enron for =
fear about the company's credit concerns. Such companies are now particular=
ly reticent to sell power to Enron for next-day delivery. What this means i=
n practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enron's ma=
rket share, which could diminish the value in the trading market that had a=
ttracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place. In addition, Enron's once-stel=
lar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse altogether=
.=20

Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to hel=
p Enron out of its financial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreeme=
nt Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate $1.5-billion asset-ba=
cked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financ=
ial woes, which will be followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion =
into the combined company by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy=
. However, some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done an=
ything about Enron's diminishing ability to secure power on the open market=
. Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sellers on the=
 behalf of Enron, in a strategy known as "sleeving." The fact that Dynegy h=
as not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some observers th=
at it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron.=20

In addition, Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state cour=
t in Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening. The petition=
 reportedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by=
 agreeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consi=
deration of other alternatives. Enron said it will defend its decision in c=
ourt.=20

Moreover, Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agr=
eement. The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any =
material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC investigat=
ion, possible litigation against Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnin=
gs forecasts. Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enron's 10-Q f=
iling with the SEC impact the company's balance sheet strengths and earning=
s forecasts, so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to term=
inate the acquisition. Clearly, this pending deal hinges on the development=
s that will take place over the next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have=
 to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and determin=
e if the once-golden company still represents a great deal, or if pursuing =
the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth.=20
