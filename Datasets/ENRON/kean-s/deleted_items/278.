Story 8322 (CPN, DUK, DYN, EIX, ENE, MIR, PCG, REI, RRI, SRE, WMB, I/ELC...)
   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the 
credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no 
changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and
gas, 
the companies said Thursday. 
  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter

of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share
price 
fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex 
financial structure. 
  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some
of 
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this 
week. 
  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John

Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 
  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has 
made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10
power 
and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any 
action. 
  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"
said 
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North 
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 
  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't 
expect to make any drastic changes.
