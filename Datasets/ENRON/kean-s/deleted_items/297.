Good morning, Rosie!
I just want to confirm that he is also okay lending his name (in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign).  
Thanks,
Misha

Misha, Ken said yes to both of these - yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3.  I'll send you the original with his note.

Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know.
