Steve, I requested the attached file from Mike Cacace of Fortune after Meredith and Vance told me they received a survey for this year's Most Admired Companies (the one that has ranked us most innovative for the past six years).  Did you select the people on this list?  It seems odd that Vance, Meredith and Mark are included this year.  Also, Rebecca Carter and Jeff Skilling should be deleted.  It appears that these surveys have already been mailed.

Hi Mary,

Please find the attached list of executives and directors that are in our
database for the 2001 Survey of Corporate Reputations.  Please review and advise
if there are any changes.  There can be a maximum of 10 executives and 7
directors.

Thanks,
Tiffany
