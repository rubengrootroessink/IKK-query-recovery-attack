Over the last few weeks, we have been working diligently with Corp. legal to identify and track violations to trademark and domain names, both in and outside the company. For those outside Enron, we are sending cease and desist letters. Inside Enron, we want to take steps to protect the company, as such, Sharon Butcher has been asked, if we can institute a step in future exit interviews, that would permit us to ask employees whether they have registered any Enron sites under their name. If so, they would be asked to identify and transfer the sites to Enron as part of any severance package agreement. This is not a small issue and frequently occurred when people started new Enron businesses. 

As an example:
Mr. Horning was with EBS until August, 2001and had registered the following domains:

	enronmedia.com
	enronmedia.net
	enronmedia.org

We will keep you posted on any final decisions and our progress in general.
