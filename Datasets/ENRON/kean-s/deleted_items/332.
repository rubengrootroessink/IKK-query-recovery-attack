Hi guys.  Steve had asked me last summer to help with crisis planning and management and I did a couple of things on it.  But then, I moved into Cindy's group, and all of our crises of a different kind arose and I have not done anything else on it.  

How would you like to handle this?  I have a few things to hand off that I had started working on, and I was going to be the first point of PR contact from Brindle's group in the event of the crisis line is set in motion.

Kelly
