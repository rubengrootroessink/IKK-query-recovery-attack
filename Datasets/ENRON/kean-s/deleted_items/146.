Steve, 

I'll be back in Houston the week of 21 Oct to discuss opportunities that might exist following my return from EBS Europe.  I'm meeting with Greg, Jim and others and I'd very much appreciate some of your time that week, if you are available.  I'll be glad to provide more details at that time.  Thanks and regards.
