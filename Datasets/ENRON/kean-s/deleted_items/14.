  <http://www.businessweek.com//common_images/it100art.jpg>BW's Info Tech 100 Revisited:

Just a reminder! You don't want to miss BusinessWeek's IT100 Interactive Scoreboard <http://bwnt.businessweek.com/it100/> (online, it includes nearly 200 companies), which tracks the performance of the top-performing technology companies. The scoreboard is updated weekly, so check it often! 

And... 

Since last you heard from us, we've added a Street Wise column on the behemoth of tech, Big Blue.

IBM: WINNING AS A TEAM PLAYER <http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2001/nf2001126_0519.htm?c=it100dec22&n=link2&t=email> recounts how smart partnering and a strong emphasis on services is paying off for the leading computer maker.

Plus, a special bonus!

JACK WELCH: "THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENORMOUS."  <http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2001/nf20011219_2981.htm?c=it100dec22&n=link3&t=email>
This Q&A between BusinessWeek senior writer John Byrne and the just-retired chairman of GE will keep you spellbound. 


If you missed it, don't forget to check out our six-month update of this year's best information technology performers -- which are ranked based on revenues, sales growth, profitability, and stock appreciation -- finds that "the picture for the overall tech sector remains pretty darn ugly." In fact, 80% of the top 100 tech companies have lost market value this year. 

Even so, the picture isn't entirely bleak. Shares of the top 10 companies on the list have jumped more than 10% this year. And one-third of the IT 100 companies have performed better than the Standard & Poor's 500 index. To get the lowdown on the good as well as the bad, check out these links:
