Most DC employees went to GW as recommended, although a few folks who had not been on the Hill decided to not to go.  Of the group who went to GW, several employees who had not been in the Hill for the last week were told by the doctor that they did not need to be tested.  The following employees were tested:  John Shelk, Pat Shortridge, Chris Long, Steve Burns, Allison Hamilton, Larry Decker, Carolyn Cooney, Carin Nersesian, and myself.  We were told to expect results in two days, although the doctors treating us expressed confidence that everyone would test negative.  Let me thank everyone for the terrific care and attention we received today.  DC continues to be an interesting place to be.
