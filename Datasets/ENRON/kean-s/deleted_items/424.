Karen,

Quick note to say hang in there.  We continue to field many questions, but
I think Joe Bob's comments in today's Chronicle were instructive.  Lots of
differences in perception by those in the credit markets vs. the
commodities markets vs. the equities markets.

Shahid Malik got caught by a couple of reporters earlier in the day at a
press briefing.  His comments, unfortunately, were supposed to be
off-the-record, so we did a follow-up with Reuters, the Chronicle, and
Platt's later in the day with Joe Bob.  I parroted what he said to
reporters who called subsequently from WSJ and the NY Times.

My best to you guys. One day at a time.

RW
