Greg -- We are scheduled to tape a video message to employees today from 1 to 2 p.m.  This will run in the "Up Front" feature on the intranet.  It is a brief video message (two to three minutes) from executives to employees about current issues and topics at Enron.  Ken Lay has done the first two videos, one about the Sept. 11 attacks and the second about the Chairman's Award.  We would like you to record a message about third quarter earnings and, specifically, about how the company will move forward.   The video will be available for employees to access on Wednesday.  The following is a draft outline for the video:

	Enron has had phenomenal continued growth.  Our third quarter earnings, announced yesterday, marked the 23rd consecutive 	quarter we have met or exceeded expectations.  Our earnings of $0.43 per share was exactly on target with the analysts' 	consensus. 	
	
	Our core business is solid, strong and growing.  Earnings in our core businesses are up 26% from third quarter a year ago.
	
	We also announced a number of one-time charges this quarter.  Ken Lay, Mark Frevert and I have spent the last few months 	conducting a comprehensive review of our businesses, and we have decided to remove some of the clouds that have obscured 	the excellent results of our core businesses.  You should have received a memo discussing our earnings in detail.

	But I want to tell you about how the future looks and how we're moving forward....
	
	Detail....
	
	Detail....
	
	We will discuss the outlook for the company in greater detail at the All-Employee Meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 23 at 10 a.m. 	Houston time.  The meeting will be webcast for employees outside Houston.  Hope to see you there.

We will tape in 50M05.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
Karen
