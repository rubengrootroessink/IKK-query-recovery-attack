         I haven't talked with WCP about the quote.  If they are
uncomfortable with it, I would be cautious.  If it is important for the
company to have it in, I would at least take out the word "rapidly".  It is
not that we are not proceeding as rapidly as possible, but I would not want
to raise expectations on a particular time.
