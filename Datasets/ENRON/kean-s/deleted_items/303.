Maryann, Dr. Holland and I are preparing a first cut draft of a potential protocol for Bioterrorism related to anthrax.  As soon as we have a completed first draft we will want to pull our group back together to review/refine etc.  Can you give some thought to whether you yourself will be directly involved or whether you will assign someone from your respective areas.  There are likely others besides our three functional areas that we will need to involve in the review and feedback process, but I'd like to start with us and then expand as we refine our recommended protocol.

Thanks
Cb

Our group is working closely with the Enron Security and Safety departments to develop a protocol for emergency response to infectious diseases within the workplace.   Last week we had an extremely productive meeting to begin the development of such a protocol.  Our primary concern is to ensure that we have a process in place to  specifically for the current anthrax concerns.   We are working to arrange testing access in emergency situations at area hospitals.  What we need from each of you is a complete listing of all field sites along with a contact that we can coordinate with in the event of an emergency.  As soon as we have this information we can then go to work to ensure that we have a plan in place in the event there is a need at a field location.  

We would greatly appreciate your giving this a priority and ask that you send information as you collect it to either Maryann Roman de Mezza or myself.  

Thanks
Cb
