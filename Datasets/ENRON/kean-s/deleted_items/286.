I ran into Joe this morning.  In making small talk, he said he hadn't the opportunity to get back to you yet.  He assumed you were calling about RTOs.  I said that was correct.  He said (don't shoot the messenger) we ought to be patient, he wants to get to the same place we do.  He said he'd be in touch soon.
