As a supporter of BIPAC you have access to a wide array of "tools," charts,
publications, the Candidate and Issues Databases, and many more.

Find out where they are and how to use them. Attend one of our Use the Tools
Workshops on the morning of October 24th in BIPAC's Conference Room. 

Please see the attached form for more information or call BIPAC Events at
202-833-1880.
