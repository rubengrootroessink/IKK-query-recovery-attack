Steven,

I am contacting you with a unique offer that will help Enron Corp. reduce
IT/software development and maintenance costs by up to 80% of what your
paying today.  I hope you are the right point of contact as I am writing to
a number of people at your organization in a variety of roles.

We have a large team of the best developers in India, the majority of who
were originally computer science graduates out of the Indian Institute of
Technology (India's premier technology university). These engineers are
experts in both commercial and application software development with
experience implementing industry standard methodologies. We provide
unbeatable rates on quality engineers with a proven track record of success
in J2EE, XML, SOAP and Web Services.

Our rates start at $6/hr for offshore and $19/hr for onsite. We are
committed to 100% satisfaction and guarantee completely the quality of our
work.  There is no catch and there is no risk.

If you do not believe you are the right person to consider this proposal, I
would appreciate it if you could forward it to the appropriate
person/people, as I am certain they will find this offer very attractive.
If you'd prefer not to be considered for this, please let me know.

Again, thank you Steven, I appreciate your help. If you have any specific
questions, please don't hesitate to call me.
