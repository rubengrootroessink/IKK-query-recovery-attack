My rating of Big 5 capability is:
=20
Accenture:  Excellent with actual integration work; especially surrounding =
applications in the financial arena, manufacturing, consumer products.  Les=
s experience with Oil and Gas; but good skills with newer web applications.=
  Prefer to take entire portions of the projects themselves, rather than wo=
rk collaboratively with customers. Expensive.  Weaker on actual M&A strateg=
ic work, planning of an integration  or leading an entire effort like this.=
  Again, prefer to have control, rather inflexible in their approach, very =
dedicated to procedure and process - which is good to an extent...but tends=
 to spend way too much time with administrative tasks and creating reams of=
 paper and meetings than getting anything done when they are managing an ef=
fort like this.   Better choice for actual integration work, but should giv=
e them whole applications or departments (like finance, or distribution for=
 example).  Not good with applications that require a lot of interface with=
 other project teams and multiple business units.  Does not play well with =
others, so carve up chunks of the effort they can do on their own and you w=
ill get good results.  Lots of M&A integration experience as a result of th=
eir close relationships in the banking industry and consolidation that has =
been prevalent there over last 15 years.
=20
PWC:  Very strong overall M&A strategy.  Great documentation of business pr=
ocesses for multiple vertical industries which can be very helpful in manag=
ing projects like this.  Project Management tools are strong, as is collabo=
ration with other project teams or other business units.  particular streng=
ths in integration work in financial services, manufacturing, telecomm; esp=
ecially with applications like SAP and supply chain.  Price wise; middle of=
 the pack.  Good choice for either role; but would recommend PWC serve eith=
er as project manager OR as integrator; not as both.  Would stretch them to=
o thin with companies your size and complexity, I think.
=20
Deloitte:  My favorite for M&A leadership and integration work.  Solid pric=
ing, great business process documentation through templates they have creat=
ed.  Very collaborative; works well with others.  Solid project mangement. =
  Experience with M&A for about 10 years; multiple projects and initiatives=
.  Good value for the money.  Particular strengths with CRM, Supply chain, =
ERP (SAP and Peoplesoft).  Vertical industry expertise in oil and gas,manuf=
, financial services, telecomm industries  Good value for money;but will al=
so work to ensure that knowledge transfer occurs; so that internal IT perso=
nnel learn as much as they can.  Very customer friendly.  Good choice for e=
ither component; project management of entire merger - due to deep knowledg=
e on process and knowledge data bases; also very strong integration practic=
e.   If I had to choose, I would choose Deloitte to manage the project.
=20
KPMG:  Weakest of all the companies in both project management and integrat=
ion work.  Has not had a lot of experience with M&A leadership; does not ha=
ve the strength of documented tools and business processes of the others.  =
Actual integration work would be ok, especially surrounding SAP, JDEdwards,=
 Manugistics.  Project Management is ok, but there are better choices in th=
e others right now.  KPMG is undergoing tremendous stresses internally righ=
t now; their European operation is really a loose federation of companies w=
ho are independantly owned.  The European portions are attempting to sell t=
hemselves to KPMG competitors; so internal politics detract from the abilit=
y of this company to focus on a large integration effort that may span 12 -=
 24 months.  Pricing is highly variable; depending upon business unit. =20
=20
Cap Gemini/E&Y.  The old E&Y had an excellent M&A practice that had years o=
f experience with actually constructing deals, managing efforts, and doing =
integration work.  Cap Gemini has some experience with actual integration o=
f companies, as they have been involved in key mergers in Europe and have d=
one some pretty impressive work with large, complex integration efforts.  C=
ap Gemini presence still very, very weak in the US; E&Y personnel are still=
 in the majority - however the E&Y personnel in the US are mainly in the ma=
nagement consultancy area, very few of the actual integration programmers r=
emain here; most  of that work is being done by the Cap Gemini side of the =
house in Europe.  Cap Gemini and E&Y have done an impressive job with their=
 own merger; one of the better run efforts in recent years; so from that pe=
rspective they would be an interesting choice.  Tools and methodology for p=
roject management are strong, integration work in US has been weakened a bi=
t since the majority of this work has been passed over to Cap, and Cap's st=
rength resides in Europe.  Pricing is mid-range, good value for dollar.  Ex=
perience with the major ERP and CRM apps; less experience with supply chain=
 and buying exchanges.  Would be a good choice for project management, and =
if integration work were to have a major European component, would be a goo=
d choice for that portion of a project like this.
=20
Bottom Line:  Best Choices for Project Management in order of preference:  =
Deloitte Consulting, PWC, CGE&Y, Accenture, KPMG
Best Choices for integration work:  Accenture/Deloitte, PWC, CGE&Y (higher =
in preference if big European component), KPMG.  Warning with Accenture:  D=
oes not play well with others, and does not collaborate well with clients. =
 If, however, Enron prefers to have a company completely manage the merger,=
 and does not wish to be involved quite a bit in this effort; then Accentur=
e is a very solid choice.
=20
Best Regards,
=20

Chris,
=20
I have 2 questions that I'd like you to put to your M&A groups.
=20
1) How would Giga rank the big consultancy firms in their ability to work a=
s overall co-ordinators for a complete company to company merger such as ou=
rs.
=20
2) How would Giga rank the big consultancy firms in their ability to work a=
s IT integrationc onsultants for a company to company merger such as ours.=
=20
=20
I need these answers ASAP as we may use your results in our choice of compa=
ny.
=20
Given what I know now, I would also request that we have your M&A expert vi=
sit us early next week, as originally planned. I will also bring along the =
head of our integration team. Co-ordinate through Katherine.
