	Early Sunday morning, a bomb exploded on the Promigas main pipeline near the city of Riohacha.  (Riohacha is located around 27 miles southwest of Ballena, the starting point of the Promigas main line.)   During the fire that ensued, five local civilians were killed (1 adult and 4 children) and eleven were injured, two seriously.  Approximately 10-15 feet of pipe was damaged as well as a valve unit.  Currently, no new gas is flowing into the pipeline -  so until the repairs are completed, there will be rationing and brownouts along the entire Promigas main line.  The Colombian government is apparently putting a good deal of pressure on Promigas to get the pipeline back up and running as soon as possible, and Promigas estimates that repairs will be completed and new gas will be flowing once again through the pipeline later today.  The Colombian army has secured the area around the explosion to enable the Promigas repair workers to safely complete their tasks.

	There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, although it is most likely the work of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The FARC appears to be following through on their earlier stated threats to continue "putting pressure" on Promigas to pay them the "war tax." Promigas President Antonio Celia has been in touch with the Colombian Minsitry of Mines and Energy, who is handling media relations on this issue for Promigas.  Media reports so far have covered the pipeline explosion but not mentioned Promigas as the owner of the pipeline.

	The Promigas board meeting - scheduled to take place this Thursday in Houston - has been relocated to the company headquarters in Barranquilla, as the board members are reluctant to leave the country while this situation is not fully under control.  EGAS' Lewis May will attend the meeting, but will stay overnight in Bogota and simply travel to Barranquilla for the day.  

	We have been in touch with our security consultants in Colombia and they will be contacting Antonio Celia to discuss the attacks and work with Promigas on the next steps to take vis-a-vis the FARC.  We will update you on any further developments as they occur.
