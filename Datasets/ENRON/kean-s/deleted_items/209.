Steve,

Thank you and Gary for hosting us on the October 17th "Getting and Keeping Your Best People" best practice meeting. We also appreciate the participation of your staff in arranging the meeting and conducting the facilities' tour.

I've received excellent feedback from the utility people attending the meeting. They believe that the ideas discussed in the meeting will help them to keep their best people in these very turbulent times in the electric energy business. The knowledge that you shared will help them to influence change at their companies, relating to both people management processes and the overall internal culture.

Thank you again for hosting us. We'll keep you posted on upcoming meetings with other best practice companies in the event that Enron would like to send someone to one of those meetings.

Sincerely,

Ron
