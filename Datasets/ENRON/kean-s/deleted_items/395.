I am out of the office on vacation from November 19-25. I will be back in on the Monday after Thanksgiving.  During my time out of the office, it will be difficult for me to be reached or to return calls or emails.  Therefore, if you require immediate attention, please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-9402.  Otherwise, I'll respond upon my return.
