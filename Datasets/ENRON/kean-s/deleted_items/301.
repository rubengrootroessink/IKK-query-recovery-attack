 Atlantic Tropical Development Outlook      Issued:   08:45 AM Monday Octob=
er 29, 2001   [IMAGE]   Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean Sea:   Morning satellite a=
nd surface observations suggest that a low-level circulation is developing =
near the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. Conditions aloft in the northwes=
t Caribbean are becoming favorable for a tropical depression to form. Most =
mid and long-range models now indicate the development of a tropical depres=
sion east of the Yucatan Peninsula on Tuesday or Wednesday. With favorable =
upper-level winds and very warm water in the region, we can see no reason w=
hy development will not occur. We now estimate the chance for development t=
o be 70-80 percent.   The next question would be - where will the system go=
 should it develop? This seems fairly straightforward. High pressure to the=
 north will be weakening by Wednesday afternoon. This should allow the deve=
loping storm to track northward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Thu=
rsday afternoon. Timing will play a major role here. If the depression/stor=
m moves into the southeastern Gulf earlier, then the threat for landfall wi=
ll be farther westward - perhaps even the Florida Panhandle. The later the =
system enters the Gulf, the farther east the track would likely be - perhap=
s the lower Florida Peninsula. In either case, it appears that Florida is a=
t greatest risk with this developing system.   As for how strong it might g=
et, upper-level winds are now quite favorable for development in the northw=
est Caribbean, so we can see nothing to stop any depression in the area fro=
m quickly intensifying to at least a moderate tropical storm. Some models a=
re indicating that this system has the potential to become a hurricane once=
 it moves into the southern Gulf. We certainly can't rule that out, but the=
re still remains a bit of upper-level wind shear across the southeastern Gu=
lf. This wind shear could certainly hinder development as the system moves =
northward into the Gulf. But regardless of how strong the storm gets, Flori=
da will likely be receiving quite heavy rainfall next Friday/Saturday as th=
e system moves across the state.   Beyond Florida, current projections take=
 a storm off the east U.S. coast and merge it with a fairly strong cold fro=
nt. It is quite possible that the storm would be losing tropical characteri=
stics as it heads northward off the east U.S. coast. In fact, the air along=
 the east U.S. coast from Virginia northward may even be cold enough for so=
me snow as the storm passes off to the east early next week.   Finally, it =
currently looks unlikely that any developing storm in the southeastern Gulf=
 would track northwestward toward the Texas or Louisiana coasts. Mid and up=
per-level steering flow appears to be from the SSW-SW. This would prevent a=
ny motion to the northwest.    Tropical Atlantic:   Tropical Depression 14 =
remains about 1500 miles northeast of the Caribbean. The depression is head=
ing out to sea and will be no threat to any land areas. There are no other =
significant disturbances in the tropics.   Chris Hebert   =09
