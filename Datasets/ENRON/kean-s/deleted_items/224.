Threat levels:

DOE is still at Security Condition (SECON) 3 modified  (no change from last week).
NERC is still at 2.5, (no change from last week).
NRC is still at the highest threat level - 3 (no change from last week).

Threats/Suspicious Activity:

On 10/23, NIPC reported that in the past week, there have been reports of several overflights of plants (both nuclear and fossil).  The FAA/FBI process to report overflights of nuclear plants has been streamlined.  Operators observing aircraft overflights should have appropriate devices (such as telescopes, binoculars, etc.) on hand to obtain the aircraft tail number. Incidents should be reported to the FAA regional offices who will then pass the information to the FBI. 

NIPC also reported incidents of "suspicious behavior" at plants including surveillance to learn layouts of plants and what is stored at the plants.  One specific threat against a nuclear facility was apparently reported through local law enforcement, although we have no specific information regarding the location of the plant or the nature of the threat.
