Suggested answer to questions....

Transaction Count Question:

For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we are again using rolling averages in all communications.  Volumes continue to hold steady at a rolling average of more than 5,500 transactions with a notional value of over $2.7 billion.

10-Q's Apparent Contradiction of Above Answer:

While the trading volumes in our core natural gas and power business have held steady, there has been some decrease in wholesale trading volumes in a few of our non-core businesses.  Additionally, due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we have seen some decrease in the number of long-term transactions.  This in no way contradicts our comments about steady EnronOnline volumes, since long-term deals are often completed off-line and would not appear in EnronOnline's numbers.  EnronOnline accounts for approximately 60% of Enron's trading volumes.

Counterparties Not Transacting with Enron Anymore:

As evidenced by the continued steady volumes on EnronOnline, our counterparties continue to exhibit confidence in us a trading partner and Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.
