As you know, we have always looked for ways to leverage investments and relationship to generate business. It is unfortunate that neither of you could attend the Texaco Grand Prix to see how we packaged, marketed and attempted to create opportunities for originators.  The event was flawless, but more importantly appears to offer some benefits for the company moving forward.

Attached is a summary of some of the existing revenue opportunities we are pursuing in concert with BU personnel. With the momentum we currently have, I have asked David to devote more time to trying to bring one or more to fruition. To track our efforts, please go into the shared page we have created for your reference. Please let us know if you require any additional information.
