This is the language being proposed by HR to go out today to EIM employees.  It would be signed by Fran Mayes, who handles HR for EIM.  Please comment.

This week, each business unit has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources for EIM on a going forward basis.  While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding the business and the employees associated with them.

Until the final decisions have been made, I ask for your continued patience. You will be notified at the appropriate time regarding the future of the team.

Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family next week at Thanksgiving and know that we are working hard on finalizing all details.
