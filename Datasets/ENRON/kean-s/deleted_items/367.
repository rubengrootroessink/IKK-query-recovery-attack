The Special Committee's investigation, however, may impact the
unaudited results set forth herein and the results set forth in the November
8, 2001 Form 8-K.  The Company has been advised by Andersen LLP, Enron's
independent auditors, that for this reason the Company will not obtain from
Andersen LLP a review of the Company's consolidated financial statements
performed in accordance with established professional standards and
procedures, which review is required by Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X,
until the Special Committee's review is complete.
