Thanks Steve. 

We're working on slightly updating the "Plan C" document you sent earlier -- it will be reworded to reflect an "intention to reorganize" - just in case we need to announce prior to actual filing.

Other than that, we're on hold.

This is the release we issued last week as an update.  I will also

recommitment to the merger.
