Karen,

Just wondering, As Enron spokesperson, are you as stupid as you appear to be in the press releases? For someone who is supposed to be the offical voice of Enron you sure don't know very much (on the other hand neither does the CEO so maybe that is what Enron wants). With talent like yours you should be in Chairman's office (don't know, won't say - all the qualities they are looking for).

Just wondering.
