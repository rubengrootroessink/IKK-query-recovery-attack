If we don't have a policy on this issue, we may want to institute one.

Subject: Protocol for Handling Suspicious Packages


Dear Clients and Friends:
 
In the wake of the incidents of Anthrax exposure in Florida, New York and Nevada, it is incumbent on all of us to take whatever measures we can to protect our employees and to alert the appropriate authorities when warranted.
 
In Kroll's efforts to guide our friends and clients through these evolving events, we are attaching a protocol developed by one of our offices for identifying and handling suspicious packages.  Please feel free to forward this protocol to any of your own colleagues, clients and friends.
 
If there is anything we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,
 
Sheryl L. Robinson
