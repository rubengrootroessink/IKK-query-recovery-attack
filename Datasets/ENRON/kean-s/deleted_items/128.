Cliff,

In reviewing recent news tied to Enron it struck me
that CatalystOne may have some relevancy to your role
as Chief Strategic Officer.

In brief, CatalystOne has a unique "Execution
Excellence" (e2) solution that enables organizations to
implement and manage their strategic initiatives
through a web based platform.  Our e2 portal helps
corporations operate more efficiently by not only
providing real-time visibility across all business
units, but also enabling them to define and link
processes and objectives down to the individual level.
e2 is an enterprise-wide solution that can: drive
alignment across operating units; enhance and foster
accountability; create a culture of collaboration via
cross-functional communications; increase visibility to
mission critical strategic objectives; and drastically
improve the execution speed of projects.

We're confident we can deliver value immediately and
are prepared to offer you our solution gratis for 60
days. Large organizations tend to spend millions of
dollars on IT without any true realizable benefits,
they tend to ignore those strategic solutions that can
be of greatest benefit to their employees, customers,
and shareholders - CatalystOne will get you on the road
to Execution Excellence.

I would like to give you a personal introduction to
Execution Excellence and detail how it can be of great
value to Enron. Please reach me directly in Washington
DC on (202) 352-6960.

Thank you in advance for your reply.

Very best,

Brooks
