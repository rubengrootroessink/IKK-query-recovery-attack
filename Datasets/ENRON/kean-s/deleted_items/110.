SK - I forward this to John Brindle and asked it he should respond to this person.  mm


Steve

I would like to know if there is any recommendation from Enron Corp. security that we could officially communicate to our South America employees. I have been receiving some material from other companies ( files attached) but till now nothing " official"  from Enron. 
Regarding Antrax which strategy the company will " officially"  adopt ?

I have already provided basic procedures to our employees at the mailroom and reception, but regarding all the others nothing.

Regards

Mervyn
