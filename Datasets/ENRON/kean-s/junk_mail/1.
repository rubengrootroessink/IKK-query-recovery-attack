Steve is set to unlimited space now. He and his assistant (or anyone else that may have it open) will need to close out of his mailbox/Outlook and reopen it in order for it to take effect.

Chris,
 
Steve's email was reset recently and the standard file size limit was re-established. This needs to be removed as Steve needs to ba able to use email and has many documents filed that he is not allowed to delete.
 
Thanks
