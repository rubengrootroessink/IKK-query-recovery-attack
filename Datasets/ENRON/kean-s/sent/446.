Can we be even stronger on this?  The short answer is that Joe's resignatio=
n=20
has no impact on our view toward India.  The evaluation of our asset holdin=
gs=20
and new business opportunities is the same the day after Joe's resignation =
as=20
it was the day before.  If need be, we can reiterate previous statements=20
about our ongoing review of asset positions.  What do you think?

Statement on Impact of Sutton Resignation on Enron in India

Joe Sutton=01,s departure should not significantly affect Enron=01,s commit=
ment to=20
the Indian market.  In fact, consistent with Enron=01,s new business lines,=
 we=20
are in the process of developing data centers and a fiber optic network in=

India.  Of course, we continuously look to optimize the value of our busine=
ss=20
interests and there may be some related adjustments in our holdings, but we=
=20
expect to continue as a significant participant in the Indian market.

If pressed:
We are not able to comment on specific plans or operations, as it is our=20
policy not to comment on the details of potential divestitures or=20
acquisitions.
