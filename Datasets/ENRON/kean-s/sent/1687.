Ken did speak with Ulf (and I believe left you a message).  I have not heard 
about further contacts as yet.

1  Do you kow if Ken Lay found Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the German 
Federal Cartel Office, at Davos?  The commercial team for Germany is just 
very keen to know.

2  Do you know if Ken was able to make any other calls on my behalf regarding 
the Bush administration?  I know he spoke to Bob Zoellick the week of the 
Inauguration.  In particular, comments to Karl Rove, Clay Johnson (White 
House personnel, I am told), and the VP would be helpful.

thanks  Mark
