Shelly just called with some updated (and revised) information:

The location of the threat was our Loop Central Office, 4828 Loop Central 
Drive, suite 620.  It's an office building, and we have about 50 IT and 
software engineers in that office.  There is no signage identifying Enron on 
the building or on the suite.  One of our employees in the office received 
the call.  The police responded, evacuated and searched the building but did 
not find anything.  All employees have returned to the building.  Ch. 13 was 
at the site briefly.
