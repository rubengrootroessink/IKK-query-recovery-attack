Take a look at the attached and let's discuss.  Maureen is in Vince 
Kaminski's group and wants to leave.  How about reg risk?

As promised yesterday, attached is my resume and the link to the FX and 
Sovereign Risk group's website.  I have also enclosed a list of the projects 
that I have recently completed.  In addition the projects, I have attached an 
inventory of the  curves that I have produced for corporate-wide deal 
assessment.  I produced 483 curves last year for 58 countries, each curve 
requires a full country risk analysis including a macro-economic policy 
analysis, balance of payments analysis, and political risk analysis.  I look 
forward to continuing to provide you with economic analysis in the future.

I hope to see you in two months.
