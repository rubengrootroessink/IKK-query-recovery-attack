What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.  We have debated 
from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" 
transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities 
to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring 
money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the 
maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity).  
Where do we stand?

These questsions seem to be focus on the modularity of the product.  This is 
fine from the vendors' perspectives, however, from a Tariff perspective, it 
hints at conceding to others' tariiffs/structures.  There should be a few 
questions that paint the entire Real Flow solution - even referencing that a 
tariff is available.

Also, can I assume the entities listed are endorsing eTransMart?  Or do they 
not even know their name is referenced here?

To All,

Mike Heinrich has asked me to make a first draft of some FAQ's for our
collaborative's web site.  I have taken a shot a several questions.  I would
appreciate if you could review the attached document and add/modify it as
you see fit.  Once you've made your additions and/or deletions, please send
it back to me by this Sunday (November 12) so that I may incorporate all the
suggestions and send out a "final" draft for the groups approval prior to
our posting this information on the web site.

If you have any questions feel free to send me questions via email and I
will respond as soon as I return from vacation on Sunday.

Kind Regards,

Dave
