SK - I emailed him and asked him to call me to schedule some time with you 
next week.  mm

Steve -

I was hoping to grab you for a few minutes in San Antonio to get some "Enron 
career advice" but wasn't able to find you at a time when both of us were 
free.  Any chance I could grab 20-30 minutes this week or next?

Chris
