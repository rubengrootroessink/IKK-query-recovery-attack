Steve:

At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they 
can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.  There are still four 
important issues, however:

IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.  This means 
that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron 
organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use 
their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic 
instead.  WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a 
separate company.
HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because 
survey responses cannot be made anonymous.  HR has already purchased a tool 
called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same 
domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent 
by the message administrator.

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and 
disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and 
read them later (as they can with e-mail).  This means that I could be away 
from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it 
would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but 
they lack commercial sponsorship.  They are hoping Corp will foot the bill 
for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing 
it company-wide.

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Do we have a sense for how many we can reach, how many we can't and where 
they are?  Are whole offices (eg Tokyo) unreachable or is it only those who 
have home offices?

Mark and Steve- 

Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning 
BackWeb before we proceed.  As you can see from the Design Document, they are 
pretty significant.

Thanks,
 Courtney
