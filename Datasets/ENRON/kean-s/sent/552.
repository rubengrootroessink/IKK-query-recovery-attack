Thanks, I have what i need.  I'm working on a project with McKinsey regarding 
the accleration of new businesses, so I wanted to look at some examples of 
employee-driven business creation.

Steve, I just wanted to assure that you had everything you needed from the 
Idea Vault.  Let me know if you need more print outs of the ideas as several 
more have been entered in the past few days.  One thing I did forget to ask 
you -- what were the print outs for?!  I need to enter it into my usage 
statistics/measurements file.

Sarah.
