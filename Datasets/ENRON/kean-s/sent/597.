In the first sentence could we say "transmission owning market participant".

The "Hub & Spoke" analysis is an appropriate method for determining the 
ability of a market participant to exercise market power in transmission.  
Market based rate applications for transmission-owning utilities merit the 
same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications, i.e., a 
competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral 
analysis whenever the screen reveals potential market power.  Modernizing 
this type of market power analysis required with market based rate 
applications is of equal importance to that of improving the analysis for 
merger applications, as recognized by the Commission in its recent Filing 
Requirements Rulemaking, Order No. 642, Revised Filing Requirements Under 
Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations, 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,164, 65 Fed. Reg. 
70,983 (Nov. 28, 2000); see also Sithe Edgar L.L.C., 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,193 
(2000) (Massey, Comm'r, concurring).
