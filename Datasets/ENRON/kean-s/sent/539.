That flight time is fine.  A couple of other things:  I need to meet with 
McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.  Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' 
office.  Also, my return should be first thing Tuesday morning (I think we 
had discussed Monday night originally).  Just get me on the first available 
flight to Roswell.

Also, I didn't mean to put you in  a difficult spot with Melissa.  I had 
tried getting hold of her last night but only got the answering machine.  
Don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule.  If I haven't told her 
first, I'll deal with the consequences (I've logged "couch time" before plus 
I'm usually pretty good about keeping her up to date).
Thanks

It turns out that the co. plane flight from Roswell to Houston only takes a 
little over an hour.

We currently have it scheduled for:

  Depart  Roswell at 7:00 p.m (MST) on Sunday 11/19/00
 
  Arrive Houston at 9:17 p.m. (CST)

Your HR PRC starts at 7:30 a.m. on Monday 11/20/00.

Just FYI - the co. plane will land in Roswell at 4:05 p.m. (MST) and wait for 
you.

Is the departure time at 7:00 pm ok with you?  
Do you want to leave a little later since the flight doesn't take very long?
