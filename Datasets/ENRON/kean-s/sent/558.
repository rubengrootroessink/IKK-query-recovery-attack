and communication matters regarding your participation on the North American 
Commission for Environmental Cooperation's (NACEC) Electricity Advisory Board 
and to provide you with the date for the upcoming meeting. It will take place 
the 16th of January at the Commission's offices in Montreal.

to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity 
restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the 
guidance and input the Advisory Board can contribute to this initiative.  
More than ever, I am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals 
serving on the Advisory Board can play an important role in defining and 
deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play 
on a continental scale.

scoping analysis, compiling a searchable database of renewable energy 
definitions and portfolio standards and initiating work in the area of market 
access and trade disciplines.  At this early stage of development of the 
expert report, I believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of 
the Advisory Board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide 
advice on the scope and content of the report, as well as the broader 
initiative.

> The Secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date 
for our first meeting so that the greatest number of Board members can 
participate. Accordingly, we will hold a one-day meeting in Montreal on 
Tuesday, the 16th of January 2001. The NACEC will cover all travel expenses 
along with accommodations and per diem. The Meeting Coordinator at the NACEC, 
Leticia Villeneuve, will be in touch to assist you in making your travel 
arrangements. If you wish you may contact her at 514-350-4313. Those Board 
members that cannot attend will be able to join portions of the meeting by 
conference call.

> I have included a draft agenda for your review along with the list of 
current members of the Advisory Board.  The Secretariat will soon establish a 
web site and list serve to facilitate our communications, including the 
exchange and review of documents. The Secretariat will also prepare, in 
advance of our first meeting, a brief but detailed report outline, including 
the major themes that are being considered for the report.  The Secretariat 
is seeking our views on the key issues that warrant special analysis.
>
> I very much look forward to meeting you soon in Montreal.  As always, feel 
free to contact me if you would like to talk over any aspect of our work 
together. Or, if you have any questions regarding the logistics of the 
meeting, please contact Alicia Chica at the Secretariat at 514-350-4330, or 
by e-mail at achica@ccemtl.org .
