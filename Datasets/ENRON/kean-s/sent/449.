Thanks, Nick.  I am anxious to get out there soon.  In the meantime I'll send 
a tape of my singing voice.

Steve, hopefully we can lure you out to Tokyo soon, perhaps when there is 
less of a crowd. 

(I can't help but think that the reason that you are not coming is to avoid 
singing that little piece from Puccini's Madam Butterfly at the office 
opening.)

kind regards

Nick:

 I was wondering if it would be a big problem if I end up not being able to 
attend the grand opening.  I really want to attend, but I am having some 
scheduling problems.

 Please let me know if my missing the event would create any problems.  (I 
know I'm important, but I'm sure it would be ok for me to miss.)

      Steve
