Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=
,=20
a big part of the problem is a "dysfunctional market" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must "behave responsibly".
Everyone must "share the pain".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=
ve=20
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=
=20
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=
=20
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=
=20
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=
=20
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=
on=20
siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20
staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=
t=20
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=
nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=
te=20
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a "share the pain" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=
e=20
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=
=20
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=
=20
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=
=20
problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=
=20
always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20
prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)=
=20
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=
d=20
(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps=
=20
them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20
articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20
around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the=
=20
political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.  Jeff will foll=
ow=20
up with one of the staff members in particular (Kari Dohn) and I would=20
suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary politica=
l=20
rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed.

Steve:  FYI.  Don't worry about the conference call, but thought it might b=

useful to review the proposals prior to Monday's meeting.

See you Monday.

Happy Thanksgiving to all.

Several IEP companies have been invited to a meeting with the Governor=01,s=

The following are some options, which the Governor=01,s office is consideri=

IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics.  IEP would=

like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday, November 27th =

o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a stat=

o Consider sponsoring/supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX board=

o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand=

o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities, to=

streamline permitting, and to develop renewable resources.
o Call for/sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would:
o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year;
o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority;
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices;
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices.
o Pressure the FERC to do its job to (1) bring about responsible seller=20
behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other=20
market interventions as necessary, and (2) provide refunds to affected=20
consumers.
