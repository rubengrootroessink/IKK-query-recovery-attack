I agree with John's recommendations.
We have been doing surprisingly well in the press.  And, for the most part, 
those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology ... we are not going 
to convert them.

Steve,

Please forgive the delay.  I was having trouble with my PC again (we have a 
replacement in the works).  We are discretely investigating this group a bit 
more, but the general conclusion is that they may be a front for one of the 
opposition groups.  We are preparing counter arguments for the general 
public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this "group."  
We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some 
groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will 
begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial 
difficulties.  At present, we are getting balanced press and I fear that any 
explanation/outreach to the most vitriolic opposition will be used against 
us.  I am available to discuss this at your convenience.

John

Please let Steve know what you think.

Thanks.

Steve, please look at the link below.  Jeff wants to know if we should get in 
touch with this group to explain our side.  Thanks, SRS
