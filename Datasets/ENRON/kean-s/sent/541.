Dear Steven,

In the Internet/Intranet security world time is everything.  Some security
vendors are using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) to revoke user
privileges.  This can be very dangerous to your data!

We would like to show you how Xcert enables its customers to immediately
revoke all network privileges from former employees, customers and business
partners while protecting their company data and assets.  We are the only
digital certificate company that provides this real-time revocation
capability because our products were built on the Internet to work on the
Internet.

Please call 800-721-9191 or send us an email so that we can arrange for you
to talk to one of our
Account Representatives who can show you how Xcert protects your data in
real-time.

Thanks,

Xcert Inside Sales
