interest.   Joe, you probably know Rick Richard pretty well.

Dear Ken: ?Congratulations on the Bush ?presidency. ?There's a lot of us out 
here from both parties who think that after Bush has finished his terms that 
you would be an ideal President yourself. ?I know you are very busy so I just 
wanted to bring to your attention two individuals I would highly recommend to 
serve at the Department of Energy. ?First Daryl Owen would be a great 
candidate for Deputy. ?He was the former staff Director of the Senate Energy 
Committee under Bennett Johnston and is very familiar with energy issues but 
also with all the weapons issues. ?I can speak at lenght about his abilities 
having known him for over 20 years. ?He also has a great respect on the Hill. 
?Secondly, ?I know you know Don Santa who would like to return to Government 
Service. ?I'm not sure what the new administration will do for the 
Chairma! ns! hip of FERC with Curt Hebert, but Don who is a Republican would 
be a 
great choice also. ?He has very good support on the Hill, has served at a 
post at LG&E ?and is also a very good policy fellow. ?Thanks for any 
consideration you might give. ?I can be reached by any of your folks at ?The 
Williard office building 202-737-2338 or at home at 703 779-0661. ?This 
retirement stuff is interesting . ?The energy business is even more so. ?
Always the best. ?Have a great new Year. ?Rick Richard
