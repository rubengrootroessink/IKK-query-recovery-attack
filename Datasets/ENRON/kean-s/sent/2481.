Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business.  
Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in 
the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us 
to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings 
outlook,"  said Skilling.
