Thanks for your comments Steve.  

The legal arguments are one piece of our 5 point action plan (it relates to 
action items 2,3, and 4) that I outlined in my November 13 e-mail to the 
group.  Action item #1 (and I agree this must be our primary focus) is to 
communicate to the Alberta Government: i) Enron's views on what mistakes are 
being made by governments in other jurisdictions in response to high price 
levels,  and ii) Enron's plans for Alberta if the Alberta Government "stays 
the course" and does not interfere in the market.   We are hopeful this can 
be done through Milnthorp and Delainey meeting with Premier Klein and/or 
Minister Cardinal.  If such a meeting isn't possible we will simply have to 
get the message through to them via lower level officials in the Alberta 
Government. 

On Tuesday Rob Milnthorp left messages for Premier Klein, the Premier's Chief 
of Staff, and Minister Cardinal, and the Cardinal's Deputy Minister, Ken 
Smith.  I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD.    The speaking points 
that we prepared to guide us through these calls are as follows:

Enron understands that electricity prices in Alberta are an important issue 
for the Government

Enron has concerns with a number of recent rule and market design 
developments in the electricity market 

Enron feel that it would be helpful for the President and CEO of Enron North 
America and Rob M to sit down for a brief meeting with the Premier and 
Minister Cardinal to:
 
1)  Explain Enron's current plans to expand commercial operations in both the 
electricity and natural gas sectors;

2) Express Enron's concerns that the Alberta electricity market "may not 
indeed be open for business" given recent developments, including:   

(i) The MAP and its adverse effect on the PPA Buyers and the "no harm" 
commitment;

(ii) Power Pool rule changes of the sort recently proposed will irreparably 
damage existing suppliers such as Enron, the ultimate effect of which will 
undoubtedly be the lack of development of much needed new supply and longer 
term high prices for consumers.  

3) Express Enron's willingness to draw on our experience in other markets and 
explain our vision of how the Government can work through this difficult 
period in the shortest possible time frame.

Ken Smith returned Milnthorp's call this morning and Rob Milnthorp advised 
that he covered each of the above speaking points and the conversation went 
very well.  Smith asked him "what would you do if you were us?" and Rob 
replied that the Government must stay the course as the alternatives will 
make the situation worse.  Rob also told Smith that Enron's preference is to 
continue to work with the Government on these difficult issues and Enron 
"doesn't like sending letters that threaten legal action to the Government or 
the Power Pool", especially since we share a common vision on electricity 
restructuring with the Alberta Government.  Smith indicated that with the 
Alberta Legislature back in session it would be difficult to get a meeting 
for us with the Premier but he would try to do so and would get back to 
Milnthorp.  

Whether we get a meeting with the Premier, or not, we still need to prepare a 
new briefing note for the government within the next week and at the very 
least Rob Milnthorp and I can meet with Larry Charach and Ken Smith to walk 
them through this document.  As you say, our document must focus on "the 
adverse effect on consumers" and the implications of the Government moving 
off the strategy it continues to publicly support (the Premier said again 
this week in question period that the problem is that we are short supply) 
which is to "allow the market to work".   

Regards,

Rob

congratulations!

One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good 
for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.

Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have 
to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations.

Do you agree?

		 Subject: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two 
weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market.   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a "problem" that requires "emergency" amendments to 
the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and 
significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage 
new generation development. 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a "terms of reference" document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.

After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:

1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis;

2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA;

3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal 
to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event 
the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies.  

Please advise if you have any comments.

Regards,

Rob
