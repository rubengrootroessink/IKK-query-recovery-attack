If we are interested in doing this, the interviewee should probably be from 
EEL

		 Subject: Story on American Companies in Europe

Dear Mr. Kean,

   Hello, I am Christian Schmollinger, a reporter with Natural Gas
Week. I'm not sure if you remember but we met at the press briefing that Mr.
Skilling held at the National Press Building at the end of the summer here
in Washington to discuss the California electricity markets.
   I am contacting you today in the hopes that I might be able to speak
with you or someone else from Enron for a story I am working on for this
week's issue concerning American natural gas marketers moving into Europe. I
was hoping I could interview someone with the company before Thursday so
that I could write the story before my Friday deadline.
   For the story, I am basically looking to do background, i.e. How is
the European market different from the American market? Will the network
business model translate well there? What kind of regulatory pitfalls do the
companies' face? Will a liquid natural gas market develop in Europe? If so,
what kind of timeline are we talking about? What is Enron's position and
take on the whole European market?
   I would appreciate any time or guidance you might be able to give me
on this subject. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate
to call. Once again, thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
Christian Schmollinger
