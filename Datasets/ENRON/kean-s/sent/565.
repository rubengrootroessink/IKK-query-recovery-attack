The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
we need to show them that as well.

The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.

They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
given them in the past -- primarily because they met so many senior Enron 
executives.  It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also 
come by to meet them.

Thanks.
