It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color 
scheme looks good.

Subject: Color coding mid-year ratings

all;
Attached are the screen shots to give you an idea how the red/green color 
coding for rating movement from mid year ratings will appear on the screen.  
Is this more of what you had in mind?   Let me know what you think.  G

Also, can you please confirm my understanding that the tenure color coding is 
TENURE AS A VP (AND MD?) and not tenure in the organization?
