Steve, Amy Kim asked me to forward this to you.  She wasn't sure if she had 
the correct email address.

Dear Steve,

This is Amy Kim (I am "borrowing" this e-mail address for the next
week and a half).  I was a Summer Associate with the CALME
Group (as it was known then) this past summer.  I was introduced
to you by Michael Moran.  As you may recall, I interviewed with
you back in September for a possible position within your division
for this summer.  Again, I appreciate you fitting me into your busy
schedule.  I enjoyed our conversation about the East Asian
economy.

You asked that I keep in touch with you throughout the last year of
my studies.  I recently spoke with Michael Moran to get his opinion
on how best to contact you.  He suggested that I e-mail you with
an update as to how I'm doing and of my continued interest in
working in Government Affairs and Regulations.

I will be graduating this June with a J.D. and Ph.D. in Political
Science.  I will be taking the bar exam for New York and
Massachusetts.  I would like to express my interest in joining your
group.  I feel that working within your group would provide me with
the opportunity to incorporate my vast knowledge of the political
arena as well as my interest in international law (environment,
energy, etc.).

I hope that you still consider me a good candidate for this position.
I look forward to your reply.

Regards,


Amy Kim
