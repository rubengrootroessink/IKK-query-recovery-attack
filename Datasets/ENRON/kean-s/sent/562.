Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy 
savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; 
not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are 
working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the 
final.

Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.

The Macerich Company has agreed to distribute the attached news release about 
our recent energy
management agreement.  Although it was a third quarter agreement, I'd really 
like to have this "officially" on the 
record.  Please review the attached draft and let me know your thoughts by 
end of day Tuesday, November 28.
x57034.

Thanks
Peggy
