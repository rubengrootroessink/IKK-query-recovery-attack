Constellation to Build Major Plant in California,=20
First in Over a Decade

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Energy Group (NYSE: CEG) announced that Kiewit Industrial=20
Company of Omaha, Neb., will begin construction in early April of the 750-M=
W=20
High Desert power plant near Victorville, Calif. The project, which has bee=
n=20
in development since the mid-1990s by High Desert Power Project, LLC=01*a=
=20
subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore, Md.=01*will be the f=
irst=20
new major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a=
=20
decade.=20

Analysis: The fact that California suffers from a significant supply / dema=
nd=20
imbalance, and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in=
=20
over a decade, has been well documented in the energy industry press.=20
Consequently, the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to=20
breaking ground on its new plant (having completed the laborious plant siti=
ng=20
requirements in California) is a major=01*and somewhat surprising=01*coup f=
or the=20
company, considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in th=
e=20
Northeast nuclear industry. Constellation Energy Group has said that it wil=
l=20
market power from the plant within California, which should prove to be a w=
in=20
/ win scenario for both the company and the state.=20

The High Desert power plant will be built on a 25-acre site at the Southern=
=20
California Logistics Airport, formerly known as the George Air Force Base.=
=20
Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June 2003. The plant's=
=20
electric generating technology is based on clean-burning, natural gas-fired=
=20
combustion turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode. Part of the current=
=20
supply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources, the=
=20
state's primary energy source, have been in short supply due to=20
lower-than-average rainfall over the last year. Moving away from a dependen=
cy=20
on hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state. In addition, the=
=20
High Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural=
=20
gas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects. As a=20
point of interest, according to data from the Energy Information=20
Administration, California's fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of=20
natural gas (45.59 percent), hydro (21.95 percent), nuclear (18.07 percent)=
,=20
coal (1.36 percent), oil (1.04 percent), and other, presumably renewable,=
=20
sources (11.98 percent).=20

It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to=20
build a major power plant in California in over a decade, considering the=
=20
company's consistent geographic and fuel-mix focus. Constellation Energy=20
Group is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy=20
businesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing, merchant generation=
=20
and portfolio management in North America. Constellation Energy Group is th=
e=20
parent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a regulated=
=20
gas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland. Up until this=
=20
point, Constellation's generation assets have been primarily based in a=20
mixture of coal and nuclear, and for the most part located in the=20
Northeastern United States. According to information directly from the=20
company itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is predominantly coal (54=20
percent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas and hydro only represe=
nt=20
a small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's fuel mix.=20

Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellation's portfolio, over the la=
st=20
year the company has become more focused on nuclear. For instance, last=20
December Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation=
=20
Energy Group, announced its intent to purchase 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82=
=20
percent of Unit 2 of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant. Once the deal=
=20
is closed in mid-2001, Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine=
=20
Mile Point's 1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The nuclear plant=20
purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset=
,=20
an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. When I wrote about=
=20
this acquisition last December, I noted that, while Constellation will most=
=20
likely retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company appeared to be=
=20
moving closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio.=20

In addition, in early 2000 Constellation began a restructuring of its=20
corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments: one=
=20
focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclear) a=
nd=20
the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant energy=
=20
business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the=
=20
third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding this growt=
h.=20
The goal for the merchant energy business, according to Constellation Energ=
y=20
Group CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 =
MW=20
of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellation=
=20
acknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of "bargain prices f=
or=20
nuclear plants," which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing=
=20
on transmission operations and thus choosing, or being mandated, to divest=
=20
their generation plants.  Constellation in the past has justified its move =
in=20
this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is=
=20
cheaper than coal and gas generators and that "the economics [of nuclear] a=
re=20
quite robust, once they are calculated out." =20

However, considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants =
in=20
the United States that will become available for purchase, Constellation=20
Energy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified.=
=20
The California market, despite its stringent plant siting requirements,=20
arguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more=20
diversified. Given the state's environmental lobbying presence, it is=20
doubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California.=20
Although natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a=20
company, it is the preferred source for new power plants. Therefore, the Hi=
gh=20
Desert plant, given that it will be fired by natural gas, presumably stood =
a=20
greater chance of navigating through California's plant siting requirements=
=20
(than a coal or nuclear plant could have). In fact, in the announcement of=
=20
the plant, Constellation noted that, having received all federal, state and=
=20
local approvals, the High Desert plant "will be a good neighbor in the=20
community with no significant environmental impacts."=20

The announcement of Constellation's new plant could not come at a better ti=
me=20
for California, of course. Although the plant won't be operational until Ju=
ne=20
2003, the state can use the good publicity now. A new report from the=20
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) says that it is already too lat=
e=20
for the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at=
=20
least 20 hours of rolling blackouts. "It's too late for this summer,"=20
declared Lawrence J. Makovich, of CERA, referring to the state's desperate=
=20
efforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term. "The source of=20
California's far-reaching power crisis is a shortage. At least 5,000=20
megawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to t=
he=20
state's grid." Instead, according to the report, demand will exceed supply =
by=20
3,000 MW, which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some so=
rt=20
for at least 200 hours.=20

CERA's report came out on the heels of Calif. Gov. Gray Davis' pledge to ha=
ve=20
5,000 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July, more=
=20
than double the amount expected just a few months ago. Davis said the new=
=20
plants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer,=
=20
which CERA obviously disputes. Davis announced a series of orders intended =
to=20
bring online 5,000 MW by July 2001, with an additional 5,000 MW by July=20
2002. =20

In any event, as California continues to struggle from a severe supply /=20
demand imbalance, the announcement of Constellation's new plant appears to =
be=20
good news for all the parties involved. Gov. Davis has pledged to support a=
n=20
expedited approval process for additional plants, so it will be interesting=
=20
to see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant=
=20
in the state. It will also be interesting to see, based on Constellation's=
=20
plant and others that may be built, whether or not the economics of buildin=
g=20
such plants in California will prove beneficial. Other power suppliers may=
=20
opt to merely enter into long-term sales agreements with the state, rather=
=20
than invest the resources that building a power plant would require.=20
