I am pleased to advise you that Enron will be one of the sponsors of the 2000 
Synergy Awards, an annual event organized by the Citizens' Environmental 
Coalition.  The Synergy Awards are given "in recognition of progress, 
achievement, hard work and/or resourceful stewardship in a broad spectrum of 
environmental endeavors."

The sponsorship will allow Enron 8 seats at the awards ceremony, which will 
be the evening of Wednesday, November 8, at the Main Street Theater at 
Chelsea Market.  They are describing it as "lighthearted and informal, 
featuring comedians from Houston's Radio Music Theater."

Are you or any members of your team are interested in attending?  If so, 
please respond to Stacy Walker at x3-3583.

Thanks, Kelly
