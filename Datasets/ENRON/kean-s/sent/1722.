Everyone---conference call on Monday Jan 29 at 2:15pm central time to discuss 
strategy for Steve Kean's participation in the Feb 2 meeting in Portland.  
Please take a look at the materials that Alan Comnes sent out earlier today 
so that we can discuss which charts/information should be included in Kean's 
materials packet.  Call in number:

 1-877-322-9654  pin #793474 host #299461          12:15 west/2:15 
central/3:15 east


Maureen--if Steve is able to join us after his 2:00 appointment that would be 
great--we should be able to narrow the discussion down a bit by the time he 
joins the call.  Thanks.

Hey all---  Paul is meeting with Gov Kempthornes office tomorrow, so we 
should be able to let everyone know where we think the governors are heading 
and it would be good to share whatever info the folks in the DC office have 
gathered prior to the WGA meeting in Portland.  Could each of you please let 
me know if you are available for a conference call on Monday Jan 29th in the 
afternoon.  I'm thinking 2:00 central.

After the WGA meeting on Feb 2, maybe it would help to get Enron's team on 
Western matters back together to discuss who will call whom?  Sue, can you 
arrange the right time, etc.?

Jim

Jim--I had a wide ranging social/business conversation with Curt Hebert on 
Saturday night at one of the inaugural events.  I'll call you to give you the 
details, including all the good things I said about you!!!  He was being 
quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that 
his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement 
with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.  I promised him that 
either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give 
him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.  My 
initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, 
but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not 
having FERC there.  As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between 
Cynthia Sandherr and me, the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also 
following this meeting, although I don't know if they are participating.

I'll call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversation

Linda--I also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that I'll need to 
talk to you about!
