Rick,

As you know, last week I had a meeting with Fernando Alonso who is the head 
of Investment Promotion at the Mexican Department of Energy.  We discussed 
the gas price policy, electric deregulation and the role that Enron has been 
playing and can play in all these matters.

I pointed to him that Presidents Bush and Fox were geting together on 
February 16th and that President Fox has been declaring to the media that he 
will talk about a common energy policy with President Bush.  

We agreed that it would be useful for Secretary Martens to Meet with Dr. Lay 
before the Presidents meet.  Fernando Alonso admitted to me today that 
Secretary Martens wanted to hear Mr. Lays opinion on this subject and perhaps 
recieve some advice with respect to talking points for President Fox with 
President Bush regarding energy policy.

Secretary  Marten's  team(and now the Secretary himself) view Mr. Lay as an 
ideal communication link between the Mexican and the U.S. Governments for 
energy policy.  This is the reason why the Secretary wants to meet with Mr. 
Lay before the 16th.  Originally they had agreed on meeting on Feb. 12th at 
9:00 a.m. Nevertheless, President Fox has asked that Secretary Martens to 
meet him in Mexico City on Monday the 12th which is why I got a call from 
Fernando Alonso asking if Mr. Lay could see Secretary Martens on Sunday the 
11th between 3:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.  

Secretary Martens has to be at a CERA dinner on Sunday at 7:00 p.m.

Fernando Alonso, Dionisio Perez-Jacome, Undersecretary Niceforo Guerrero and 
myself will be meeting tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. to talk about electric 
deregulation.  They are expecting an answer from me by then.

Dionisio Perez-Jacome president of the CRE (FERC equivalent) is going to be 
in Houston on Monday the 12th.  I would like you and Steve Kean to meet with 
him if you are going to be in town.  I would also like to organize a tour for 
him that day.  We'll talk about this tomorrow night when I see you.

Thanks for your support.

Ricardo
