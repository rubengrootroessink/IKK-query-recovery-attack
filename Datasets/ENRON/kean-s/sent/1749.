I think this might have been intended for you.

Steve Kean asked that I respond to your voice mail message to him regarding 
your solicitation of government economists for your proposed May customer 
conference.  Let me suggest the following, each of whom has different 
attributes:

1.  David Wilcox, Asst. Sec of Economic Policy of Treasury, soon to rejoin 
the Federal Reserve.   David is an excellent macro economist but is not a 
"big name."
2.  Ted Truman, Asst. Sec of International Affairs, Treasury.  Ted is about 
join a think tank.  Before his stint at Treasury, Ted served 26 years at the 
Federal Reserve, many of which he served as Greenspan's right hand on 
international currency issues.  Ted has quarterbacked about every 
international currency intervention conducted by the United States over the 
last three decades.  
3.  Larry Summers, Secretary.   Larry will be joining a think tank for a few 
weeks.  He may or may not be available.  If the topic is of interest to him, 
he is agreeable to travel and speaking engagements.  
 
This is just my initial cut at some suggestions.  Once we know the Bush team, 
we may want to explore possible candidates from their ranks, although 
government ethics rules may prohibit us from paying for their travel to a 
"customer conference."  Government officials can accept travel from 
50l(c)(3)s, as a general rule.
