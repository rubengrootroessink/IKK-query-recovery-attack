I received a call today from Rep. John Culberson about a nascent campaign 
underway to nominate Ken Lay as NASA Administrator.  Rep. Culberson has 
broached this idea with Eugene Cernan, who liked the idea .   The Congressman 
asked that we check to see if Ken is interested, as he would like to 
orchestrate a campaign on Ken's behalf.  I promised the Congressman to check 
as to Ken's interest.  Steve, should I snuff this out?  Give him 
encouragement?  I need to call the Congressman back very soon.  Thanks.
