This could become a very deep pit.  I don't want to distract you from the=

Also, we have never explicitly talked about whether your focus is North=20

heavily modified by the fact that most Enron employees (current and probabl=

Mark, Steve,

I'd be happy to get us involved with this, but I'm not sure how we're=20
handling non-North American University affairs.

Please let me know and I'll follow up with Rajesh.

Thanks!
