I would drop the second sentence (it's a bit convoluted).  I would also like 
to look at what else the ad says -- ie how are the quotes introduced, what 
other quotes will be used, etc.

		 Subject: Pew Center ad - Ken Lay Quote

Steve:

The Pew Center on Climate Change is planning an advertisement to run in a 
special supplement to the Washington Post and International Herald Tribune 
around the time of COP 6 climate treaty meetings in the Hague in November, 
and they would like to include a quote from Ken Lay.   A similar quote was 
included a Pew Washington Post ad that ran in April 2000.

I've revised it a bit to read:   "Enron supports market-based initiatives 
that create efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sound energy 
systems.  As a company, we use our global networks to provide innovative 
solutions that help the world meet its energy needs while reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions."

Unfortunately, they have given me very short notice and would like an answer 
by COB today.   If you could let me know sometime today if this is OK to run, 
I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jeff
