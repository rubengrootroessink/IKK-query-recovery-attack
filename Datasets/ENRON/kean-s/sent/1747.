I left a voicemail for Rosalee.  She should be contacting you once the inaug. 
is over.

		 Subject: Ken Lay's DC Schedule

I would like to explore how the DC Office can plug in on the advance planning 
of Ken's DC trips.  As we get things organized here I want to do a better job 
of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town.  This is 
hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements.  I do not want 
to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enron's presence 
in DC.  What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news 
sources today that Ken is giving a speech (participating via panel) at the 
Club for Growth's event tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in Senate Dirksen.   We 
have been busily planning all of Enron executives' trips to the inaugural and 
I thought I had something of a handle on each executive's itinerary.  So this 
came as a surprise.  A second  problem with this is that it is being hosted 
by Craig Shirley Associates.  I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc. 
is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our 
tactics and strategies on electric restructuring.  Ken may not know this 
relationship.  Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his 
attention.  I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively 
add our input.  Thanks.
