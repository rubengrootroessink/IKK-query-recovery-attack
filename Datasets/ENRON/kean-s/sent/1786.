PLEASE E-MAIL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR AS SPECIFIED 
BELOW:

Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all the 
various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible; otherwise to the rent location.  If you are being 
charged for phones/lines/services, etc. not belonging to you, or the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, please contact 
the Notes Mail ID "Move-Team" or move-team@enron.com and place a request for 
the disconnection of that line, hardware, or service.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

If the billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be 
corrected by contacting FMS/EPSC or the person should be moved to the correct 
SAP company/cost center by contacting an HR representative.
