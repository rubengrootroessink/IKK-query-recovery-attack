see below.  I'm sure your guys are considering all of the applications in d=

Not asking for any special treatment for this individual, but, as we=20

seems to have those skills.

Attention: MR.  STEVE  KEAN
  MS.  CINDY  OLSON    =20

Dear Mr. Kean and Ms. Olson:

I am privileged and delighted for providing me with this opportunity of=20
writing directly to both of you, while I am on re-deployment status.

The purpose of this letter is to respectfully appeal to both of you to plea=
se=20
help me continue serving Enron and continue being an active manager within=
=20
this most challenging environment, as I feel I am most qualified.

I joined Enron EE&CC on March 1, 2000; now am an EES employee. I am a=20
Mechanical Engineer, with 32 years work experience and extraordinary track=
=20
record in the oil & gas and power generation EPC business worldwide, with=
=20
major global organizations. =20

I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specifically in the Gas Turbines=
=20
Technology). I have been a Project Manager, Senior Project Manager, and=20
Project Director on major multi-million Dollar onshore and offshore=20
development projects since 1980, in every hydrocarbons  producing region.

I was interviewed at Enron=01,s EE&CC in mid February 2000 pursuant to my=
=20
application for Project Manager/Senior Project Manager position. =20

I was then hired on March 1, 2000 as Project Engineering Manager (PEM), und=
er=20
quite urgent circumstances, to be in charge of all three (3) major and most=
=20
active Power Projects at EE&CC in Brazil.  Just one (1) week later, after m=
y=20
new hires orientation, I had to join a delegation and travel to Brazil for=
=20
Due Diligence of Local Engineering and Construction Contractors. =20

The Expected NTP was January 2001, and the life of these foreign Projects=
=20
(except for Electrobolt =01) simple cycle plant) is three (3) to four (4) y=
ears,=20
i.e. until the year 2003 and 2004.  These Projects are RioGen, Cuiaba II, a=
nd=20
Electrobolt.

I was attracted to Enron due to its standing and recognition in the industr=
y,=20
reputation, globalization, and active market penetration.  In fact, I felt=
=20
very fortunate to become the center of the above-mentioned challenges with=
=20
three such major Enron Power Projects.

I resigned my then current and very secure position as Senior Project Manag=
er=20
at Solar Turbines Incorporated (a Caterpillar company), after almost 6=20
successful years, where I was entrusted with Solar=01,s major turnkey power=
 and=20
gas compression projects, worldwide.=20

My prime objective and priority then, when I accepted to work for Enron wer=
e,=20
clearly, to tackle and continue with the new challenges that Enron offered =
me=20
until the year 2003 =01) 2004. =20

However, I am still very optimistic and hopeful that, with your kind suppor=
t,=20
I am hoping to receive due consideration of this appeal.

I have already interviewed with Messrs. Steve Meyers and Dave Roberts at EE=
S,=20
and both believe that they are certainly in need of a strong technical pers=
on=20
like myself, but no confirmation has been received yet.

I have also applied to at least fifteen (15) pertinent positions within EES=
,=20
ENA, and Enron Transportation but, unfortunately, have received no response=
=20
yet.

Nevertheless, I am most certain that you do not want to loose a knowledgeab=
le=20
and active member of your team, and I am most confident that you can assist=
=20
placing me in a position where I can contribute most positively to Enron=01=
,s=20
continued success and profitability.

Sincerely,

Adel
