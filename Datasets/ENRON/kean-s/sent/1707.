Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.  There are a couple 
of follow-up items:

Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in 
identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the 
extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written 
this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- 
please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should 
identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that 
could be sent to the FERC.
Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the 
fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is 
necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for 
open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 
2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- 
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get 
them to Linda?
Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to 
"price gouge" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's 
community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while 
California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response 
from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic 
messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California 
policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively 
pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the 
nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.
