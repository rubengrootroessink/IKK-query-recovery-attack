Dear Peter,

We are very happy with your suggestion and we would like to propose that the
presentation also includes the interactions between power and gas trading
and access to networks, since the conference is about the convergence of
these two sectors.

We would be very greatful if you could identify the speaker and the title of
the presentation during the following days so that this can be included in
the programme as soon as possible and go for final printing.

What do you think about a title like?: Trading of gas and electricity and
access to networks : what does the California experience learn us?

Best regards and thank you agan.

Ana

Reverting to you after some delay, Ana, I confirm our willingness to
provide a senior speaker. We may be able to secure a Houston-based
corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
European power markets. This would still be a trading and wholesale
perspective, and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
imports and exports across state boundaries. What do you think?
Regards,
          Peter.
