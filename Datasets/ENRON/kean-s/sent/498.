Sorry to bring more to you but perhaps this is something that Rob Walls could 
easily look through.  Global has a contract that is ready for signing.  
Global is involved as an investor in Razorfinish.com.  The person who is 
supposed to sign the contract is procrastinating as long as possible bec ause 
the contract is not in the interest of Enron.  I told the person not to sign 
it regardless of the pressure from Sanjay.  Hopefully, Rob could get to it.
