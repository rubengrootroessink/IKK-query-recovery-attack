>>Be careful what you wear (or don't wear), when working under your
>>vehicle...especially in public. From the Sydney Morning Herald Australia
>>comes this story of a central west couple who drove their car to K-Mart
>>only to have their car break down in the parking lot.
>>
>>The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car

>>there in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people
>>near the car.
>>
>>On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under
>>the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned

>>private parts into glaringly public ones.
>>
>>Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward, quickly
>>put her hand UP his shorts and tucked everything back into place.
>>
>>On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself
>>staring at her husband who was standing idly by.
>>
>>The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.
