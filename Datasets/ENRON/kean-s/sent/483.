		 Subject: Azurix, Grand Rapids contract

John Stokes. Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon.  
Varnum is currently representing the city on isolated matters.  Varnum is 
approaching the city attorney to obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest 
so that they may engage in lobbying activities on Azurix's behalf.  Eric is 
very confident that the city attorney will issue with waiver.  Varnum made it 
clear that should Azurix lose the contract and wish to engage in any legal 
action against the city, then Azurix would not be able to use Varnum b/c of 
their existing relationship with the city.  John assured Eric that it is 
extremely unlikely that Azuriz would ever pursue legal action against the 
city.

John Stokes has asked that Varnum deal directly with Tom Maxwell in the 
Edmonton office once the waiver is obtained.

They will keep us posted on progress.

I have spoken with Eric Schneidewind our attorney at Varnum, Riddering, 
Schmidt and Howlett in Lansing.  He is contacting other attorneys in the firm 
to follow up on this immediately.  Varnum is one of the two major west 
Michigan law firms and is based in Grand Rapids.  

John Stokes and I have spoken.  As soon as I learn anything from our 
attorneys, I will be in contact with him.

I also have a call into our lobbying firm, Karoub Associates.  I doubt that 
they could be more effective than Varnum on this one, but I want them in the 
loop b/c they might have some pull with key officials in Grand Rapids.

I will keep you posted.

John -- I'm copying Janine and Barb on this message as they are most likely 
to be able to identify someone.

Janine and Barb -- could one of you get in touch with John?

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?
