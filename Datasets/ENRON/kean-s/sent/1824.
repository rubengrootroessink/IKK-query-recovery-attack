Steve,

Let me know if you agree that we switch to a uniform range of numbers...

Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus

For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street  
address from 1400 Smith St to 1500 Louisiana, we propose that 
Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all in-bound 
telecommunications.
This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID 
to an employee
and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a "Plug 
n Play" environment.

Currently we have over 21000 DID's in operation in the following locations EB 
, 2AC , 3AC , 500/600 Jeffersen and Penzoil Place . 
The numbers are spread across three different ranges :

- 713 853 xxxx ( 6300 numbers )
- 713 345 xxxx ( 10,000 numbers )
- 713 646 xxxx  ( 5,000 numbers )

The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future 
requirements. The benefits are :

 - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users
 - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area
 - increased capacity from one  range of numbers to cater for Fax or 
multimedia applications
 - have a new identity to fall in line with ''One Enron'' philosophy

Due to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area, we will not 
get a (713) area code allocation, and we will be looking at the new ( 832) 
area code.
We have been investigating (832) 363(ENE) XXXX as the range, however this 
cannot be guaranteed.

To take this forward, I require high level approval of the scheme, we will 
then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committee's to meet Enron's 
requirements.
