Gentlemen

I just got off the phone with David Stark who wanted to better understand the 
thinking behind Enron's preference for a smaller marketing deal rather than 
the full sponsorship that Uva and Stark pitched last week.  I reiterated to 
him that we would not normally entertain such a large deal without a 
significant commercial transaction (or series of transactions) and that the 
size of the opportunity set currently in front of us only justified 
discussing the smaller marketing deal as indicated in Steve's email.  Stark 
pressed to know what value we wanted to see in the set of AOL/TWX/Turner/CNN 
deals that are underway currently.  He was clear in stating that if we had a 
number in mind, he could push other parts of the organization to direct 
business our way sufficient to meet our needs to justify a larger 
sponsorship.  I declined to give him a value, but I think we should discuss 
this in some detail.  

I'll get in touch to set something up.
