Ken has talked about EES willingness to invest this money in demand side 
management, if the right program were set up -- eg a demand buydown program.

Apparently there are rumors that Ken Lay promised to make some kind of 
investment in California when he was talking to folks in the state ($300 
million in DSM?)  Do any of you know what this commitment might be?  Sandy 
needs to be filled in on this.  Let me know as soon as you can.
