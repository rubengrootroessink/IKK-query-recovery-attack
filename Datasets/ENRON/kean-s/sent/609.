Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the 
results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make 
sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott 
Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.

Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's 
PRC.  If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.

Hi Steve--I don't know if you will be expected to represent me in the PRC, 
but I thought I'd send you my accomplishments in case you are.  Or for 
interesting reading anyway!
