Steve, Ken did sign the Advisory Council letter.  He does want to brief the 
Enron Board at the December meeting, if it can be worked into the agenda.  I 
am copying Rebecca on this also.

Rosie

p.s.  Do you want us to mail out the Advisory Council memo letter?

Please ask Ken to sign the following.  But, in the Advisory Council letter 
delete the reference to the December Board meeting and check with Ken on 
whether he still plans to brief the Enron Board at the December meeting (I 
believe he talked to Kelly Kimberly about this).

Steve,

Per our meeting yesterday, attached are the draft letters from Ken Lay to the 
Board and Advisory Council.  l will deliver a box of Annual Reports today so 
that they can be delivered to Rebecca Carter once the letters are signed and 
returned to you. 

Please call me if there are any questions.
