Pete,

I would like to weigh in on this, if you don't mind.  First of all,  I 
requested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our procedures 
and our status.  So, no fair ranting at Don.  Secondly, your note brings to 
mind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currently 
stands.  It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department's 
responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the 
audit process.  It is the responsibility of the business leader and the 
business management.  So, follow up with the companies should have been a 
communication from you to the business unit head, not from Don to the 
business and Don to you.  

But, we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime, we aren't 
going to get crosswise with each other.  This is going to be an "open kimono" 
kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me.  I will 
be staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the support 
groups, with the business leaders and with the executive managment..  And, 
problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for the 
business and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter of 
performance between the business and myself.

So, please, calm down and let's all get off on the right foot.  Enjoy your 
holiday, darn it!

Rebecca

Don - really - this kind of upsets me - I thought you were going to call me 
if we were having any problems - this report looks like crap and is not 
reflective of actual status - I know TGS has completed most of its 
outstanding items -  Does your team call and follow up with the individual 
companies - requesting a status report ?    If so give me the names of who 
called and who you talked to  and the date of the call.   What is the concern 
about Cuiaba - they got a 90 + score -  TGS and Centragas are in South 
America - not carribbean.   Why did you not list the scores ?     Really - I 
think this report and the handling of transmitting this information is 
completely different from my understanding of our understanding of how this 
is supposed to work.    You were going to follow up with the companies and 
let me know if there were any problems and I was going to go fix the problems 
-  Report says there are problems and the first I hear of it is when  you go 
and report to my bosses.   This does not begin to reflect the concepts we had 
discussed.

Guys, for your information and a heads up.  I am going to be visiting with 
Rebecca and Jim this afternoon on their support going forward on timely 
completion of action items as well as support that the audit program is 
mandatory not optional.  We have always had both of you guys support so no 
problem there.  David, you may want to talk to Stephen about IGL. and Pete 
you may want to look at Cuiaba.  If I can help, please let me know.

Don
