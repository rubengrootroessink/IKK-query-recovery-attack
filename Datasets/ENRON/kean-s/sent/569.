I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to 
see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's 
problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling 
them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an 
opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc.  
What do you think?

Can you please review?  We'd like to send as an informational
piece to our California customers.   Prices are up to $14 today
and not expected to drop anytime soon.  We're using this letter
and follow-up calls to try to curtail load.  I can explain further if
needed.
