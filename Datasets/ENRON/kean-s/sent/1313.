Steve,

Linda will need to talk to you.  She has legitimate concerns that Enron 
should not be too eager to help Wyden on this issue as it could be turned 
against us.  already, the May 10th Energy Daily article states (incorrectly) 
that Wyden is mulling a bill that will require energy traders to release more 
market data.  I have already flagged for Wyden's office that this is not the 
intent of the bill and that if it is used to attack merketers that Enron 
would not support it.

Linda suggested that John Shelk and I meet with Wyden's office to get his 
commitment that any such amendments will be killed.  Are you in Japan?
