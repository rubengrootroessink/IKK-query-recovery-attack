Cindy -- it seems to me we should use an HR distribution to get this out.  
Let Mike and I know what you think.

Steve,
 the attached is a one page summary safety notice to describe to management 
the requirements of the OSHA ergonomics rule and our action plan to comply.  
I need your advice on an internal distribution list for the notice.   Thanks, 
Mike T.
