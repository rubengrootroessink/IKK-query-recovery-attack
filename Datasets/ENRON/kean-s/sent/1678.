Kalen,

I spoke with TJ today and he indicated that he is interested in talking with 
Enron ; however , he and his spouse were taking off for a five week break 
between jobs ( he said he had told Ken of his plans ). That he would like to 
set something up in late March upon his return. I will call him and set  up a 
date with him. We have a good lead time to get on the G9 calendars.

I will keep you updated.
