Melissa:

Steve has another trip to New York coming up.  He will fly up late afternoon 
on Thurs., April 19.  He speaks at a conference sometime in the morning on 
Friday, April 20.   I plan on flying him back that afternoon (or if you go 
too and want to come back Sat. or Sun - that will work too).

Are you getting excited about your birthday trip coming up?   I bet you both 
can't wait to really get away.

     Maureen
