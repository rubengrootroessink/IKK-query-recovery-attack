Steve:

Given your phone call, below is a first draft of what I think should go to 
the senior person at each California office.  Please review and make changes 
where necessary.

Thanks

Enron's policy is to periodically remind offices of procedures to follow for 
proper screening of mail.  If an x-ray machine is available in your office, 
all incoming mail and couriered packages should be scanned.  If no x-ray 
machine is available, you should scan you mail visually, looking for the 
following:

- Priority markings such as 'Rush', 'Personal', or 'Confidential'
- Excessive postage
- False or missing return address
- Poorly typed or handwritten address
- Incorrect titles
- Addressed to titles, but no names
- Misspellings of common words or names
- Oily stains or discolorations
- Excessive or uneven weight distribution
- Excessive tape, string or twine
- Rigid, uneven or lopsided envelope
- Protruding wires, screws, or other metal parts
- Postmark is different from the return address

The existence of only one or two of the above characteristics is acceptable, 
but more than two on the same peice of mail should be considered to be 
suspicious, and the item should not be opened.  In case of receipt of a 
'suspicious' letter or package, you should isolate the item and call your 
local police imediately.
