RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said Monday it will invest 
$455 million in its gas distribution business in Brazil from 2001 to 2004. 
Robert Gross, vice president of Enron's Brazilian unit, also said the company 
plans to spend $970 million on thermoelectric projects, but he didn't specify 
any timetables for the projects.
Gross said Enron will spend $142 million on gas distribution projects next 
year in Brazil. 
Currently, Brazil's energy regulator Aneel is in the process of licensing 
companies to build and operate a total of 44 new thermoelectric plants. 
U.S.-based Enron primarily operates in Brazil as a gas and energy 
distributor.
