Melissa,
I sent Jean and draft agenda and workplan framework onthe 28th, and so she'll 
probably want to send out some additional meeting information once we have 
the date/time confirmed.  But in the interests of scheduling the meeting with 
everyone's busy schedules, I appreciate you starting the process with next 
Friday March 9th before 1pm or so (to accommodate Mark in London).  

The following people are on the subcommittee and should be invited:  
Steve Barth, EBS
Steve Kean, Enron Corp
Jimmy Mogal, Enron India
Miguel Padron, Enron South America
Mark Schroeder Enron Europe

Thanks! Call me if you need anything further.  I think I will be in Houston 
next Wed- Friday (but possibly may be here Tuesday also).
Catherine
