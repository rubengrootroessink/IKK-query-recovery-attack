Thank you very much for the note.  Sorry I am so late replying (I am on my 
way to another round -- House hearings this time -- and was recalling your 
note).  It is amazing to me how many people saw the hearing on C-span 
(nothing worthwhile on the Weather Channel, I guess).  Thanks again, and 
welcome aboard.

Mr. Kean,

I would like to tell you I watched your testimony  from Wednesday's Senate 
hearing on C-Span and was very proud to be a member of the Enron team.

I am a new employee in the Gas Logistics department, scheduling PG&E 
Northwest for the West Desk (Rockies).  I am also new to the industry and 
unfamiliar with most external factors affecting the current situation 
regarding the sell of Natural Gas to California.  I found your presentation 
and testimony enlightening, direct, and informative.

Thank you for showing to the world Enron is synonymous with intelligence, 
knowledge, and respect.

Respectfully,
Daniel Lisk
