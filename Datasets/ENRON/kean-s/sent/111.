Enron has begun its executive solicitation for United Way.  You should have 
received an email providing the intranet address where you can pledge 
online.   
(Please note:  when entering the information online - enter 4 digits for your 
birth year).

I encourage you to be the leaders in giving for Governmental Affairs/Public 
Relations and make your pledge this week.  

Further, please invite the generous participation of the people in your 
groups.  Thank you for your involvement.
