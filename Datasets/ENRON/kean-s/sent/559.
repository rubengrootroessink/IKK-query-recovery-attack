I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can 
see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting.

I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons) if possible.

Steve,

Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.

We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
overall message.

Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.

Thanks,
Dan Marcontell
