=09=09 Subject: Outline for Project on Real-Time Markets

Dear Steve,

Once again, I call on you for advice. Who, within Enron, should I talk with=
=20
about a new project I am working on, related to real-time balancing=20
operations and markets (all the messy stuff that causes so many problems=20
within all the existing ISOs)?

Here is the outline for the project. Can you send me your suggestions on=20
revising the outline, other people at Enron (and elsewhere) to contact=20
related to these markets, and written materials on how the various ISO=20
markets operate.=20

Thanks.

Eric

ISSUES TO DISCUSS FOR PROJECT ON:
REAL-TIME BALANCING OPERATIONS AND MARKETS
November 6, 2000

1. Introduction: Importance of real-time operations and markets=20
Essential for reliability, especially security=20
Basis for all forward contracts (hour- and day-ahead, block monthlies,=20
bilaterals)=20
Real-time prices motivate generation-capacity decisions: new construction,=

2. Physical Requirements and Operations=20
Balance generation to load in near-real time (intrahour)=20
Normal conditions (frequency response, CPS1, CPS2)=20
Contingency conditions (DCS)=20
In neither case is it necessary for generation to exactly balance load over=

short time periods (e.g., 10 minutes), but must balance energy over longer=

intervals=20
Benefits of aggregation=20
Performance and characteristics of individual generation and load resources=

hydro units, etc=20
Control-area balance vs individual-schedule balance, good vs bad inadverten=

NERC and FERC requirements=20

Unit commitment=20
Economic dispatch=20
Regulation=20
Contingency reserves=20
Control area forecasts of loads and resources, effects of forecasts on unit=

commitment and dispatch=20
Treatment of (payments and penalties for) energy imbalance and inadvertent=
=20
interchange=20
4. RTO Operations and Markets=20
Generation not owned by RTO, RTO must purchase outputs from generation and=
=20
load resources=20
Relationship between real-time operations and markets, how are resources=20
dispatched (and by whom) and how are they compensated=20
Time interval (1, 5, 10, or 15 minutes) for dispatch and price setting; wha=
t=20
are the tradeoffs in choosing among these intervals=20
Single market-clearing price in each interval vs pay-as-bid for each resour=
ce=20
Pay for energy only or pay also for maneuverability (e.g., ramp and=20
acceleration rates); how do resource constraints determine which resources=
=20
are permitted to set the market-clearing price and which aren't, and why?=
=20
Set prices ex ante or ex post? If prices set ex ante, what is the basis for=
=20
the value?=20
Should unit commitment (resource scheduling) be done by individual supplier=
s,=20
by RTO, or both?=20
Relationship between real-time markets and ICAP and RMR requirements, and R=
TO=20
requirements to ICAP and RMR units to bid resources into real-time market=
=20
Treatment of exports and imports, rules governing interchange scheduling=20
(number of schedule changes per hour permitted, ramp rates for schedule=20
changes)=20
To what extent does the RTO make short-term forecasts of load and generatio=
n,=20
how far into the future (10 minutes to 24 hours), how does the RTO use thes=
e=20
forecasts? Should the RTO commit and dispatch resources on the basis of=20
expected future conditions (i.e., beyond the current and next interval)? Wh=
o=20
pays for these RTO decisions?=20
Should RTO publish prices and let demand and supply respond to the price=20
signal, or should RTO dispatch resources up and down based on supplier bids=
?=20
If the RTO explicitly dispatches resources, should uninstructed deviations =
be=20
treated differently, in terms of payment or penalties, from instructed=20
deviations? What about a resource=01,s failure to follow instructions?=20
Under what circumstances should RTO go =01&out-of-market=018 for resources?=
 What=20
should set the price of (payment to) these resources?=20
Under what conditions, if any, are penalties appropriate, for what kinds of=
=20
behavior, what determines the magnitude of the penalty? Should penalties=20
apply to generation only or to loads also?=20
How, if at all, should capacity assigned to ancillary services (especially=
=20
the reserve services) be incorporated into real-time operations and markets=
?=20
For example, should the capacity assigned to contingency reserves be set=20
aside and used only when a major outage occurs? Or should such reserves be=
=20
used routinely whenever it is economic to do so, as long as sufficient=20
capacity is available to meet the NERC reserve requirements?=20
How should intermittent resources (e.g., wind) be treated in real-time=20
operations and markets? Should they be treated any differently from a large=
,=20
volatile load?=20
Can retail loads participate in real-time markets? How?=20
5. Case Studies of U.S. ISOs=20
California=20
PJM, New York, and New England=20
ERCOT=20
 6. Conclusions and Recommendations=20
Key features of operations and markets=20
What works=20
What are the options=20
What problems still remain=20
