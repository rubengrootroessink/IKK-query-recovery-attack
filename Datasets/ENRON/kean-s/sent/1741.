Dear Steven,

You have very kindly directed us in the right direction before.

Derek (Goodwin) has asked me to contact you. Derek is organizing a UK
Technology Forum on behalf of the Houston British Consulate General &
Invest.UK offices to be held in Houston in March. The purpose of which is to
foster & strengthen links between the technology-driven communities of
Houston & the UK. BT will showcase the leading-edge technology
infrastructure in the UK and a British Consulate General/Invest.UK speaker
will outline of the resources available to facilitate business expansion to
the UK.

The Forum will take the form of a breakfast & include the welcome &
introduction of a keynote speaker and a panel of 3 other speakers from
Houston based technology companies that have set-up an operation in the UK.
The panelists will give a brief overview of the why's & wherefor's behind
their decision to locate in the UK. The Forum will conclude with a moderated
Q&A session.

As Houston is a fast growing high-tech city, especially in the energy
sector, Derek has asked if you can refer him to the right person within
Enron with whom he can speak regarding Enron's possible involvement in the
Forum.

We'd appreciate any help you can give.

Sincerely,

Brian Medd-Sygrove
Vice Consul (Investment)
Invest.UK
British Consulate General
