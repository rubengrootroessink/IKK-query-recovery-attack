I would very much like your help on this.  I agree that we should follow up 
on the others and if it doesn't work, then pursue some Bush people.  the 
evening before for Pres -elect Bush is a good idea too; can yu follow up?

I talked to Phil Cassidy.  The meeting dates cannot be moved, as you probably 
suspected.  I would suggest that we make calls to find out the availability 
of the congressional leaders given that they will likely be in recess.  
Gephardt has already declined.  Once we know their status, we may want to 
consider inviting key members of the Bush Cabinet.  We may want to also 
explore the availability of key Committee Chairs.  Phil also noted that we 
should consider having the President-elect during the evening program of Feb. 
21.  Let me know if you want us to handle next steps from DC.
