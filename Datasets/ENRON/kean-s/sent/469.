Did Ken ask us to sponsor it or just consider it?  I'm wondering what if 
anything we gain from such an investment, but I have an open mind on it.

Steve: Reference is made to the letter Ken Lay forwarded to you asking Enron 
to support the dinner at which The Nixon Center will present to AIG CEO Hank 
Greenbert their annual architect of Peace Award. I would recommend that Enron 
sponsor a table at the rate of $10,000. Linda and I could co-host the table 
and invite others as our guests. Please review and advise. Joe
