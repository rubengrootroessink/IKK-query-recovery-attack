It's a hoax..  This e-mail made it into a reporter's hands and the reporter 
asked about this in the Clinton-Lazio debates in NY.  CNN covered the hoax 
the next day.

The US Postal Service denied it, of course. By the way, I have never seen a 
letter -- "P" -- following a bill number in the Congressional numbering 
system.
