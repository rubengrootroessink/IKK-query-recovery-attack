POWER POINTS:Calif Gov Fiddles As Summer Likely To Burn

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
    

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Once there was a bride whose pianist became ill the
night before a beachfront wedding. As she frantically tried to find a new
pianist, the radio blared an alert: A 40-foot tidal wave was headed straight
for the beach.
    
?


"I just will not let this pianist ruin my wedding," muttered the bride as she 
turned the radio off. 
California Gov. Gray Davis and the state Legislature have no better sense of 
priorities than the bride did. They've been obsessing over the financial 
solvency of the state's utilities for three months, instead of making 
progress on the bigger problem: the huge shortage of electricity expected to 
hit the state this summer. California's multibillion dollar purchase of the 
utilities' transmission lines won't add one megawatt to the supply of 
electricity. 
How big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand? The 
California Energy Commission forecast two weeks ago that the 60,000-megawatt 
system might just squeak by with 87 MW to spare in a bad heat wave. But 
nobody takes that forecast seriously. 
The CEC's numbers are way off base. California's electricity demand could 
exceed supply by 5%, or 2,000 MW, on days with typical summer weather. That 
2,000 MW shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in 2 million 
homes, or a mix of homes, businesses and industry. A bad heat wave would get 
shortages several times that size. As the blackouts roll through parts of the 
state every weekday that temperatures are at or above normal, every business 
and home will take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or 
so. What factory can operate under such conditions? Will the state's elderly 
survive the heat exposure? 
The CEC put the capacity of generators in the state at about 54,000, but it 
used original capacity figures. Most of California's big power plants are 
more than 30 years old. They can't produce as much power as they once did, so 
subtract about 7,000 MW from their rated capacity. 
About 15,000 MW of the state's capacity is now controlled by merchant energy 
companies Calpine (CPN), Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy (DYN), Mirant (MIR), 
Reliant Energy (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB). They say they already have sold 
much of the power they will generate this summer to out-of-state western 
utilities. But the CEC ignored that. 
Hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just 60% of 
normal this spring and summer. Western utilities have been buying up supplies 
since last fall. California's PG&E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) 
couldn't do that, of course, because they're nearly bankrupt. 
Nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state. A 
trader at one California merchant power company estimated 5,000 MW. In a 
recent auction of transmission line use, capacity to move electricity out of 
California sold for up to 15 times the price of transmission capacity to move 
power into the state. 
The CEC ignored the sales of California power to out-of-state generators in 
its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for below-normal hydropower, 
which depends on winter snowfall. The snowfall season is three-fourths over 
now, making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal. Yet the CEC used 
normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast. Take off another 
2,000 MW. 
The commission expects 3,000 MW of generators to be off line for unplanned 
repairs when the heat wave hits. That's California's historic average. But 
outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave. Take off another 
2,000 MW. 
The commission expects all 1,000 MW of Davis' recently announced peaking 
generators to be on line for the summer. "No way," says the industry. 
Instead of the CEC's estimate of 61,000 MW, then, California can expect 
available supply of only 44,000 MW. The state needs 51,000 MW to meet demand 
and maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets, on 
average, every two summers. 
People in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months that 
there's no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next. Siting and 
building power plants takes too long. Demand has to be reduced to the level 
of supply. 
The current course is to reduce demand through blackouts. Pricing offers a 
better way. If the state raised electricity rates immediately - a step no 
longer opposed even by California consumer group The Utility Reform Network - 
California would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves 
needed to keep generators running this summer. 
Davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to 
damp demand. Several western U.S. utilities outside California have already 
imposed such rate hikes. Davis is focused on buying power, even though 
California can't subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much 
longer. The Department of Water Resources is signing 10-year power supply 
contracts at hefty prices that fully reflect today's supply-demand imbalance. 
Instead, he should be addressing the imbalance, which must be dealt with 
sooner (by prices) or later (by blackouts). Raise California rates 
significantly now. Cut demand, and the wholesale price for electricity comes 
crashing down. Then sign long-term contracts at the lower rates. 
Davis is committing California's citizens and businesses to 10 years of 
overpriced electricity. After that, he says, he will try to reduce demand. 
His streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken.

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.
By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer
?????WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
?????But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
?????Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
?????Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
?????The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
?????Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
?????"We don't know how bad it's going to be yet," said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. "We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."
?????In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
?????In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
?????"California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. "Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West."

?????Captive Plants Feed Power to California
?????Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
?????Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
?????More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
?????A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
?????From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
?????And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
?????"The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what," said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
?????"If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand." And, he added, "you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did."
?????The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
?????In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
?????All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
?????"It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand," said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
?????"Now," he said approvingly, "it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money."

?????Plans Go Awry in Many States
?????Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
?????If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
?????But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
?????Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
?????Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
?????"Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven," said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
?????But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
?????"I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon," Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. "I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?"
?????Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
?????Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
?????But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a "razor's edge," according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. "We have no cushion."
?????Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
?????Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. "Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California," he said.
?????One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
?????They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
?????The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
?????When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
?????That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
?????The result has been a string of crises across the West.
?????In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
?????In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
?????In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

?????Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
?????The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
?????The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that "California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly." (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
?????Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, "plundered 
provinces"--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
?????But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. "A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage," said Stanford historian Richard White.
?????The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
?????In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
?????"The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent," Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
?????In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
?????Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
?????(Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
?????Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
?????Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
?????But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
?????The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
?????Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
?????"California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that," the Utah governor said. "That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
?????"But," he added, "there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren."
?????If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

Plant Construction Stalled Over State's Effort to Revise Contracts 

Power: Small "peaker" generators could help California get through the summer 
without blackouts. 

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--The construction of a fleet of small power plants--capable 
of supplying 1 million homes--is being stalled because of a dispute between 
state officials and the plant builders.
?????Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis toured a power plant under construction 
among the orchards of Sutter County. He ordered state Energy Commission 
regulators to roll out the red carpet for anybody willing to quickly build 
small, sometimes temporary, generators called "peakers" to help the state get 
through next summer without blackouts.
?????Yet plans for 29 such plants, which have been in the works since last 
fall, have been slowed by the state, according to the companies hired to 
build the plants. The problem, they say, is that the California Department of 
Water Resources, which was pushed into the electricity business on an 
emergency basis last month, is trying to amend 4-month-old contracts for 
construction of peaker plants.
?????State officials say the original contracts gave too much to the plant 
builders, and they want to save the taxpayers money by revising the terms.
?????"We're not delaying any construction," said Davis spokesman Phil 
Trounstine. "We're providing financial assurances for the generators and 
protections for California consumers."
?????"There's no reason," he added, "that these guys can't rework these 
contracts and get these plants up and running on time."
?????But peaker plant operators say the contract revisions probably will slow 
down construction. 
?????Last week, Harold Dittmer found out that the department wants to stretch 
to 10 years the terms of what had been a three-year contract with his 
company, Sacramento-based Wellhead Power.
?????He said he is scrambling to alter land and equipment leases and isn't 
certain he will get his four power plants installed in the Central Valley by 
the target dates of May and July.
?????"Having to renegotiate the agreements adds uncertainty, and uncertainty 
adds time," Dittmer said.
?????Some of the other eight companies with contracts to build peakers say 
they've also been asked to alter their contracts.
?????"The projects will not be done in June, as originally contemplated," 
said Dale Fredericks, chief executive officer of DG Power Inc. in the San 
Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek. His company intends to build seven small 
plants around the state with the combined capacity to supply more than 
340,000 homes.
?????These gas-fired plants, some so small they fit on the back of a big-rig 
truck, are designed to run a few hours at times of heightened demand. Most 
are slated for construction on existing industrial sites, such as utility 
substations.
?????Officials of the Department of Water Resources did not return calls for 
comment. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said department officials are 
confident that the plants will all be finished this summer. He said the 
agency--thrust into the power-buying business as a result of the 
near-bankruptcy of the state's two biggest utilities--wants to amend the 
original contracts to save money.
?????"We're simply trying to get the best prices for taxpayers," Maviglio 
said.
?????But in slowing down the plant construction, the department's action 
undermines the governor's campaign to quickly expand the state's power 
production. Two weeks ago, Davis ordered the Energy Commission to offer 
licensing of such plants in 21 days or less. On Wednesday, the commission 
published a list of 32 sites around the state that could, by its estimation, 
quickly and easily accommodate a peaker plant.
?????Among these sites, targeted for proximity to transmission lines and 
natural gas supplies, are an airport in Kern County, the port of Long Beach 
and a cardboard recycling plant in Ontario.
?????"Our target is 1,000 megawatts," said Energy Commission spokeswoman 
Claudia Chandler.
?????Fredericks, the power plant builder, said the state's best shot of 
getting that much peaking power built by this summer is through existing 
contracts like his. So many plants are under construction around the country 
that there is often a long wait for delivery of the turbines, compressors and 
other crucial components of a power plant, he said.
?????"We've been working on this six months, so we have equipment lined up," 
said Fredericks, who searched worldwide for the parts he needed. "But 
somebody coming in right now probably can't find the equipment."
?????His company and eight others signed contracts last fall with the 
California Independent System Operator. That nonprofit agency, based east of 
Sacramento in Folsom, was established under the state's 1996 deregulation 
plan to balance the flow of electricity on the transmission grid reaching 75% 
of California.
?????Typically, Cal-ISO wouldn't be in the business of soliciting 
construction of power plants. But a scarcity of supply complicates Cal-ISO's 
job. Managers looking ahead to the summer of 2001 predicted last year that 
the state would be short of electricity by one-fifth of what it needs on 
those hottest afternoons when demand for power spikes upward.
?????Warning of "a very substantial risk" of rotating blackouts in the summer 
of 2001, Cal-ISO officials signed contracts last October and November for 29 
small power plants to be built by June. The plants would be capable of 
providing 1,279 megawatts of peak-time electricity--enough to supply more 
than 1 million homes--at a cost of $214 million a year for three years.
?????That would amount to about $6 per California household per year, Cal-ISO 
staff figured.
?????"These costs," wrote Cal-ISO management in a memo to its policy-making 
board of governors, "should be weighed against the financial, social and 
human costs" associated with blackouts.
?????"We saw the summer of 2001 coming like a freight train," said Brian 
Theaker, manager of reliability contracts at Cal-ISO. "And we gulped and 
swallowed and said, 'We've got to do this because nobody else is.' "
?????Those contracts were signed despite the misgivings of two appointees of 
the governor.
?????In an Oct. 26 letter, Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta 
Lynch and Michael Kahn, head of the Electricity Oversight Board, complained 
that the contracts for peaker plants seemed too expensive.
?????They urged Cal-ISO to refrain from signing the contracts until the PUC 
could check whether Edison and PG&E were willing to build the plants more 
cheaply.
?????But the utilities came forward with no such plans, and the Cal-ISO board 
approved the contracts.
?????Under those contracts, the plants would be required to produce 
electricity for 500 hours at most this summer, when called upon to do so by 
Cal-ISO.
?????But work on the plants tapered off in January, when the deteriorating 
financial condition of Edison and PG&E threw the future of Cal-ISO into 
jeopardy.
?????Cal-ISO doesn't actually buy electricity. It bills utilities for the 
power it needs to balance the grid. So as Edison and PG&E spiraled toward 
bankruptcy in December, Cal-ISO lost its credit-worthy status, and 
companies--and their lenders--feared doing business with the agency.
?????To calm those fears and to get construction underway, the Department of 
Water Resources has offered to replace Cal-ISO in the contracts. But that has 
not yet happened, as department officials seek to change the contracts. The 
state has hired a Massachusetts firm, Navigant, to renegotiate the deals.
?????"If DWR would just assume the contracts as they are, we'd all be in high 
gear," Dittmer said.

Electricity Crisis Dims Firms' Opinion of State 

Polling: Four out of 10 small companies are less happy about California's 
business climate, and 20% are looking at a move. 

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 

?????Four out of 10 small companies say California's electricity crisis has 
dimmed their view of the state as a place to do business, and nearly two in 
10 are exploring a move to another state, according to a survey released 
Friday by the National Federation of Independent Business.
?????The survey, one of the first to attempt to 
?????gauge the toll on business from the energy meltdown, follows other polls 
issued this week that illuminate vastly different views of deregulation and 
the retail competition that it is intended to spark.
?????Most California consumers said they still favor electricity competition, 
in a survey conducted by J.D. Power & Associates. More than half of the 750 
people interviewed said they did not understand deregulation, but 64% said 
the state should continue to support competition in the electricity industry.
?????But another survey, by the Booz-Allen & Hamilton consulting firm, found 
that most commercial and industrial companies were "wholly unprepared" to 
take advantage of retail electricity competition around the nation and that 
few switched to new electricity providers. While most of those that switched 
saved money on their electricity bills, 10% paid the same or even more for 
power.
?????If nothing else, the three surveys underscore that problems in the 
electricity industry are confusing, expensive, frustrating and disruptive for 
all involved.
?????"This is a major issue, the No. 1 issue, for small business," said 
Martyn Hopper, state director for the National Federation of Independent 
Business, an advocacy group for small companies.
?????Although California businesses have raised serious concerns about both 
energy costs and supply, the state's economy so far has shown only limited 
damage.
?????Just more than 20% of respondents said they had been hit by blackouts 
since the beginning of the year, the telephone survey of 523 small businesses 
conducted for NFIB by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research of Maryland found.
?????But there clearly was some confusion among those answering the survey 
about whether these were the rotating blackouts that hit Northern and Central 
California on Jan. 17 and 18, or whether these were voluntary power outages 
under utility programs that ask businesses to cut electricity usage when 
supplies are extremely tight. For example, 9.4% of respondents in the Los 
Angeles area said they had experienced a blackout when no forced outages 
occurred south of Bakersfield.
?????For whatever reason the lights went out, more than half of the 
businesses were forced to severely curtail or terminate business operations 
for the entire blackout.
?????About one-third said they lost sales, nearly 21% said materials were 
damaged or destroyed, and nearly 40% had to absorb wage costs for work not 
done.
?????Businesses were almost evenly split on whether the blackouts would lower 
earnings, and nearly eight out of 10 were not planning any layoffs as a 
result.
?????But the electricity mess has damaged the companies' views of California 
as a secure business home. Slightly more than 43% said the power problem had 
changed their views about California as a place to do business, and nearly 
71% said it had shaken their confidence in the state's political and business 
leadership.
?????But a whopping 69% said they have no intention of moving their companies 
to another state.
?????"Our members don't have the option of moving to Texas or Colorado" in 
search of cheaper or more reliable power, Hopper said. "A lot of them are 
family owned and minority owned . . . and they want to do business in 
California."

NEWS ANALYSIS 
Once Accused of Inactivity, Davis Now Takes Lead Role 

The governor has shifted into campaign mode in the power crisis, trying to 
convince voters, critics and investors that he can steer the state toward 
recovery. 

By DAN MORAIN and RONE TEMPEST, Times Staff Writers 

?????Just a month ago, Gov. Gray Davis was under fire for failing to move 
quickly and forcefully to quell California's energy crisis.
?????But in recent weeks the governor has moved into campaign mode--touring 
power plants with TV cameras in tow and issuing a steady stream of 
proclamations that declare victories in the power battle.
?????His mission is to convince voters in California, analysts on Wall 
Street, and politicos across the country that he is up to solving what he 
insists on calling the energy "challenge."
?????Davis is doing what any politician on the hustings would do: Head out to 
a power plant under construction as he did recently, put on a hard hat and 
tell gathered reporters that he is working to make sure the state will have 
enough power to meet its needs.
?????"Because it is so complicated and hydra-headed," said Garry South, 
Davis' chief political consultant, "we really felt he had to move out and 
simplify and objectify what he is doing." Otherwise, people simply wouldn't 
see that he had a plan to solve the problem.
?????"This isn't rocket science," South added. "The communication tools and 
techniques that any elected official has" don't differ that much "from what 
is available in a campaign."
?????Davis arrived Friday night in Washington, D.C., on the first leg of a 
five-day East Coast trip that will take him to Wall Street. In recent weeks, 
he has compiled a story to tell of actions he has taken that suggest he is on 
top of the situation.
?????Critics counter that his plans are half measures. On Friday, for 
example, he did not announce a final deal to rescue the state's three private 
utilities from their multibillion dollar debt. Rather, he proclaimed that he 
had the framework of an accord with one of the utilities, Southern California 
Edison.
?????However, the goal is to show progress, even if it's incremental.
?????"The public just wants it solved," said Democratic political consultant 
Darry Sragow, who doesn't work for Davis. "He is working to show that he is 
working to solve the problem. If there is a view that no one is solving his 
problem, all hell will break loose."
?????The actions are a far cry from the situation in January, when utility 
executives, power generators and lawmakers were loudly blaming Davis for 
failing to recognize the power crisis and for not taking steps soon enough to 
get California on course for recovery.
?????Davis confidantes say there was no single event that led to the 
governor's decision to position himself as the man who would lead California 
out of the crisis. But the governor pays close attention to 
politics--conferring at least weekly with his team of political advisors and 
regularly scrutinizing public opinion polls.
?????After convening two focus groups on the topic last month, the governor 
and his political advisors, led by South, concluded that Davis needed to take 
a higher profile. The prospect of the state's two major utilities going broke 
also spurred the governor into action.
?????"It became important to let Wall Street, creditors, generators and the 
public understand that we were making progress." said Davis' communication 
director Phil Trounstine. "That's a big piece of why you've seen the governor 
personally carrying the message."
?????Davis still has critics, including many in his party. But few can say 
that he is still suffering from inaction. He is pushing for a state 
takeover--at a cost of more than $7 billion--of private utilities' electrical 
transmission systems, and spending money at a clip of $1 billion a month to 
buy electricity.
?????Flush with a multibillion budget surplus, the Davis administration has 
spent more than $2 billion to buy electricity so far. It is offering an extra 
$400 million for conservation measures, and pledges to spend millions more to 
speed construction of new power plants.
?????Aides say practical reasons prevented Davis from taking a more public 
role sooner. He was spending most of his time gaining an understanding of the 
problem, and looking for solutions.
?????Davis was freed up only after he assembled his energy team, led by 
former Edison executive Michael Peevey, San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, 
and Department of Water and Power chief S. David Freeman. The trio gave Davis 
the expertise to negotiate with utility executives and power generators.
?????Once they were in place, Davis had time to make public appearances, like 
the one in Yuba City earlier this month, themed around generation and power 
plant construction--the stuff of photo opportunities.
?????"It was a collective view that because this problem was so complicated 
and abstract, he had to move out," South said.
?????And of course, Davis' political future is widely seen to ride on the 
outcome.
?????Lawmakers give Davis credit for deflecting blame for the crisis from his 
office, even if it means they pay the price. But now that Davis has taken the 
lead role, he faces risks if the plan fails.
?????"I'm convinced, if it blows up, he is going to get the worst of it," 
said one senior Democrat.
?????Added Sragow: "We're not talking about anything that is particularly 
subtle or sophisticated. The governor is chief executive, the point person. 
If the person who is the obvious choice doesn't lead, there will be unrest, 
and someone will try to fill the vacuum."
?????Davis' efforts are beginning to result in some praise. A utility 
executive who a month ago was highly critical said after Davis announced the 
makings of a rescue plan for Edison that the governor "forged a difficult and 
creative and complex agreement.'
?????"I think you have to give him points for that," the executive said.
?????This story was reported by Dan Morain in Los Angeles and Rone Tempest in 
Sacramento.

			California has appetite for electricity, but is no power glutton

ANDREW BRIDGES, Associated Press Writer 
			?
			Monday,?February 26, 2001 
			Breaking News Sections 
			
			
			
			
			

			
			(02-26) 12:39 PST LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's power crisis has led 
neighboring states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity. But the 
numbers tell a different story. 
			California does use a vast amount of electricity. But it consumes less on a 
per-capita basis than all other states except Rhode Island. 
			The mild climate and less heavy industry than other states are part of the 
reason. Experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation measures. 
			``It's true we're big, and it's true we didn't build a lot of power plants. 
... But we're not energy hogs at all,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, who sits on 
the five-member California Energy Commission. ``We're almost as good as 
Western Europe, and Western Europe is about twice as energy-efficient as the 
United States.'' 
			Among the 50 states, only Texas consumes more energy -- measured by its total 
use of electricity, natural gas and oil -- than California, the nation's most 
populous state. 
			However, California ranks 47th in per-capita energy use -- well below No. 4 
Texas, No. 20 Washington and No. 27 Oregon, according to the Energy 
Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Energy Department. 
			When looking specifically at per-capita electricity consumption, California 
ranks 49th, at 24.2 million BTUs, the agency said. Californians' per-capita 
electricity use is only 60 percent of the national average. 
			For air conditioning alone, a typical California household uses one-third the 
amount of electricity consumed by a household in Texas or Florida, according 
to the U.S. Energy Department's 1997 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. 
			California has ``a different climate, so even if you do have warm summers, 
they're not humid, so you don't have the big, huge air conditioning load you 
see in Florida or Texas,'' said Robert Latta, the survey's manager at the 
Energy Information Administration. 
			California also uses electricity, as well as natural gas, oil and coal, more 
wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started 
during the oil shocks of the early 1970s, federal and state data indicate. 
			Key to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial 
buildings that dictate such things as the types of windows and lighting and 
the amount of insulation. 
			``If it is not the leading state, they are at least tied for it'' in 
efficiency standards, said Ed Wisniewski, deputy director of the Boston-based 
Consortium for Energy Efficiency. ``Historically, they have been very 
progressive, and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in 
California.'' 
			California's per-capita use also is lower because many energy-intensive 
industries are located elsewhere. Aluminum smelting and paper manufacturing, 
for example, are clustered in the Pacific Northwest. 
			The industries that are located in California, however, are generally more 
efficient in their use of electricity than industries elsewhere, according to 
1998 figures from the California Energy Commission, which shapes state energy 
policy. 
			Companies use just 0.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity to produce every 
dollar's worth of goods and services in California, while businesses in 
neighboring states use twice as much, according to commission figures. 
			``The concept that California is a big, wasteful state really isn't true,'' 
said Latta, of the Energy Information Administration. 
			There is still room for improvement in California, particularly when it comes 
to conservation. California ranks just 17th among all states in spending by 
utilities on energy-efficiency programs as part of their revenue. 
			In 1998, California utilities reduced spending on energy-efficiency programs, 
though the current crisis has prompted the major utilities to reverse that, 
according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
			Gov. Gray Davis recently released a $404 million conservation program 
designed to control growth in the state's demand for electricity. 
			Maintaining energy efficiency and keeping demand in check as the population 
grows will be among the toughest challenges in the years ahead. 
			Energy use per capita is up 10 percent over the past two decades. 
Californians used about 7,000 kilowatt hours per year in 1980, compared with 
about 7,700 kilowatt hours last year, according to scientists at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory. 
			And many people are moving to inland areas where they find cheaper housing 
but also face more severe summer temperatures that require greater use of air 
conditioning.

USA: U.S. West spot power lower as plants return to service.
? 
02/26/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Spot electricity prices in 
the U.S. West for Tuesday delivery were lower, weakened by the 
return to service of some key power plants and comparatively 
light loads across the region. 
Dealers noted the list of plants returning to service 
included the 750 megawatt Unit 1 at the Navajo coal-fired plant 
in Arizona, the 750 MW Unit 1 at the Ormond Beach gas-fired 
plant in southern California and the 739 MW Unit 6 at the Moss 
Landing gas-fired plant in northern California . 
Their return was offset by the start of a planned outage at 
the 750 MW Unit 3 at the Navajo plant and expectations that the 
739 MW Unit 7 at the Moss Landing gas-fired plant would be 
brought down shortly for a planned upgrade. 
There was also talk that the 508 MW Boardman coal-fired 
plant in Oregon had tripped off line over the weekend although 
market sources said they believed the unit was back up on 
Monday morning. 
Loads were reduced by generally mild daytime temperatures 
across the region although cold nights boosted offpeak demand. 
The California Independent System Operator (ISO) forecast 
loads on the 75 percent of the state grid it oversees would 
peak Tuesday at 29,285 MW, down from an expected peak on Monday 
of 29,814 MW. 
Natural gas prices were steady to slightly higher with a 
range of $12.00-14.00 per million British thermal units 
compared with an average on Friday of $12.25. 
Gas fuels about a third of California 's power plants. 
Weather Services Corp. forecast Northwest temperatures 
would be mostly 2-4 degrees F below normal through Tuesday, 
near normal Wednesday and near normal to 10 degrees above on 
Thursday and Friday. 
Southwest temperatures were seen averaging 3-12 degrees 
below on Tuesday, 2-8 degrees below on Wednesday, near normal 
to 4 degrees above on Thursday and near normal to 8 degrees 
above on Friday.

Calif Pwr Plan May Face Stumbling Blocks In Legislature
By Jason Leopold
? 
02/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Key lawmakers in the California Assembly and Senate 
on Monday were only willing to offer partial support for a plan by Gov. Gray 
Davis to buy the power lines owned by the state's three investor-owned 
utilities. 
Their hesitance calls into question the chances of quick passage for the 
measure, which is the centerpiece of the governor's plan to keep the state's 
two largest utilities from sliding into bankruptcy. 
"There are way too many unanswered questions about it, both fundamental and 
logistical questions," said the chief of staff to one key Democratic 
lawmaker. 
On Friday, Gov. Davis announced at a news conference that he reached an 
"agreement in principle" with Edison International (EIX) unit Southern 
California Edison to purchase the utility's transmission lines for $2.76 
billion, roughly 2.3 times their book value. 
Davis said he hopes to finalize the deal by Friday, when he also hopes to 
announce similar deals for Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric 
and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric . 
Davis aides said the state is willing to pay about $7.5 billion for the 
26,000 miles of transmission lines owned by the three utilities. 
The buyout is aimed to restore the utilities to solvency and help them 
restructure nearly $13 billion in undercollected power costs the companies 
have amassed during 2000. 
But lawmakers said the measure won't sail through the Legislature. State Sen. 
Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said 
she isn't willing to sign off on the transmission plan until the state 
secures concessions from generators and other creditors. She also questioned 
the price the governor has offered for the power lines. 
"There are a number of advantages to having the state own and control the 
transmission lines, but it's not something we should do at any price," Bowen 
said, adding that the deal should also have value to ratepayers. 
For the past several weeks, key lawmakers Bowen, Assembly Speaker Robert 
Hertzberg, Assemblyman Fred Keely, Senate leader John Burton and Assembly 
Republican Minority leader Bill Campbell, the Democratic and Republican 
lawmakers who have stood with Davis during previous news conferences, have 
been missing. 
Advisers said the lawmakers have decided not to endorse Davis' plan until 
more information has been released. Sen. Burton, who introduced legislation 
three weeks ago to have the state purchase the utilities' transmission lines, 
also wouldn't declare his support for the governor's plan. 
"As the governor noted, this is an agreement in principle, and the 
Legislature awaits further details," said Burton press secretary Dave Sebeck. 
Other Democrats refused to comment on the transmission plan, while 
Republicans have been the most vocal opponents. 
"I don't see how we can pay for the transmission lines without a rate 
increase," Campbell said. "If you refinance your house from a $100,000 
mortgage to a $230,000 mortgage, you're going to have to pay more. That's a 
simple fact. 
Consumer groups have blasted the governor's proposal, likening it to a 
bailout of the utilities. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utilities Consumer Action Network, 
said the price the state is offering to pay for Southern California Edison's 
power lines "is the outer limits of what can be financially justified as a 
purchase price for the transmission." 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he 
will try and overturn the measure with an initiative on the 2002 ballot. 
But Davis isn't worried by his critics, whether they be Democrat or 
Republican. 
"Responsible Democrats and Republicans will vote for this," said Steve 
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.
