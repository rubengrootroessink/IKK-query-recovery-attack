Steve and Brad:

We need to coordinate schedules in order to interview these last 2 candidates.

Stacy Durbin needs a round 2 interview and Tony Pule needs round 1 (he had a 
death in the family and was unable to attend last week).

Please let me know when during next Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday (February 
26-28) you would be available to donate 1 hour to interview these candidates.

Thank you!
