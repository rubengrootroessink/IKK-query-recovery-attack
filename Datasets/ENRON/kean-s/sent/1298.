Subject: Logistics for May 22-23 Western Energy Forum

Dear All:

We are pleased that you will attend the May 22-23 Forum on Securing the
Energy Future of the Western United States in Denver.  Please confirm this
by sending a quick note in reply to this e-mail that you can attend.

If you are coming in from out of town and you would like a hotel room at th=
e
Denver City Center Marriott for May 21st and/or May 22nd, please note that
in your response, as well.  Rooms are available at $89/night.  We will
compile a room list from here, however, and you will not need to make a
reservation directly.  We will send you a confirmation number, once you hav=
e
sent us your hotel needs.

Some brief logistics regarding the Forum:

?   Registration will begin at 7:15 a.m. on Tuesday, May 22nd on the fourth
floor of the Chamber of Commerce building, 1445 Market Street.  The Forum
will start promptly at 8 a.m.  A continental breakfast will be available
beginning at 7:15 a.m.  For those of you coming from the Marriott, either
walk or take the free 16th Street mall shuttle west to Market Street, turn
left or south on Market Street, walk two blocks to the red brick building
with the blue star on it.   Parking lots are readily available in the
vicinity of the Chamber building at a cost of $6-$8/day.
?   The Forum will recess by 5:00 p.m. on the 22nd, but we will reconvene a=
t
6:30 p.m.at the Marriott for a cocktail reception prior to dinner at 7:15
p.m.   We would like everyone to come to the dinner.  It is part of the
program.  Chris Hessler and Chris Miller of the U.S. Senate=01,s Environmen=
t
and Public Works Committee will speak on Congressional and Administration
policy.
?   Dress for the Forum is =01&Denver-style,=018 i.e., casual.  The same is=
 true for
dinner.
?   On May 23rd, a continental breakfast will be served beginning at 7 a.m.
with that morning=01,s program beginning promptly at 7:30 a.m.   The meetin=
g
will move to the second floor of the Chamber building in the Junior
Achievement Room, just left off the elevator, in the Chamber building.
?   We hope that everyone will remain at the table for the day and a half
Forum.  This is important given the critical nature of the Forum=01,s agend=
a.

Please don=01,t hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments or
concerns.   My colleagues and I look forward to seeing you on May 22nd.
