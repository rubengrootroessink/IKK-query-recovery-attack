Jean has responded to Rick and I.  She doesn't feel that she has room in her 
budget to pick up a partial headcount.

Cindy and Steve:  Please see Kathy Mayfield's split responsibility proposal.  
She initially discussed it with Jean Ryall at the beginning of January just 
prior to the start of the legislative session.  Unfortunately, Jean has not 
responded to Kathy's numerous inquiries.  As you can see, Community Relations 
can use Kathy for United Way, but that will account for only 40% of her time, 
with 60% designated for legislative/economic development activities under 
Jean.  Please let me know your thoughts on how to proceed.  I am nervous 
about a full-time role for Kathy should Jean not be interested in supporting 
these activities and want to make sure that her talents are optimized for 
Enron.
