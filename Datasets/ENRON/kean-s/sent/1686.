Mark Palmer and I would like to celebrate three well-deserved promotions by 
gathering  the three of you and a date of your choice with a few good 
friends( that's you folks on the cc: list and your dates of choice) for 
dinner at my house.  Since I don't cook well, some might say "at all" , Mark 
has gratiously offered to do the honors-- I will provide the venue and the 
wine (that I can do.)  The date we have chosen is Friday,February 9 and the 
time is 7:00 p.m. The location is in River Oaks at 2910 Del Monte (the corner 
of Del Monte and Kirby).  The attire is casual.  The evening is guaranteed to 
be FUN. Please let me know as soon as possible if you can join us. Thank-you.
