LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or 
move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people 
who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind 
(Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the 
company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's 
hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of 
interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done 
much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in 
the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.

Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, 
or find him something through the redeployment process?

Subject: Government / Regulatory Affairs Opportunities

Per a conversation with Steve Kean, I am forwarding a copy of my resume for 
your review.  Since coming to Enron, I have desired an opportunity in our 
Government / Regulatory Affairs area.  While here, I have been involved in 
the commercial end of the business; primarily on the international side and 
now in EBS.  I would like to discuss possible opportunities with you as soon 
as possible.

Thanks for your consideration.
