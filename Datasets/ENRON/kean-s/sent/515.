Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail 
while she is out.  Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many 
others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).  But, if this is a 
standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in 
California, I think it leaves a bad impression.  Can we find a way to direct 
urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external 
lobby team?
