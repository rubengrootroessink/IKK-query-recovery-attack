Subject: Ken Lay, Good Guys Award


Steve,

Lou's sister, Sue Yang, is a member of the National Women's Political 
Caucus.  This organization has an annual award called "Good Guys" award, 
honoring nationally known men who have supported women on women's issues.  
This year they would like to honor Ken Lay, if he is interested.  Sue does 
need to know if he supports the equal rights amendment and particularly the 
pro-choice amendment as her organization is a pro-choice organization.

Sue can be reached at 908-707-0022 if you would like to speak with her.

Please advise on the above.

Karen
