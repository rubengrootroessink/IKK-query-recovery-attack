Mr. Steve Kean
Executive Vice President
Enron Corp
 
Dear Mr. Steve Kean
 It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week. I have a few 
follow up questions.
1)According to today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jeffrey Skilling, president 
and chief executive-elect of Enron, is saying the company could sell some 
power to PG&E and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour. Am I understanding 
your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will 
it help your business at all?
2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of 
April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set 
up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be 
better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading?
3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to 
California?
