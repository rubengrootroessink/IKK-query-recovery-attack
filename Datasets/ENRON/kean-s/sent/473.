I believe the registration deadline for the Nov 7 election has passed.  I'll 
ask Eliz to forward the registration materials to you so you can be ready for 
the next election.  Also, if you were registered in Harris County before you 
may still be on the rolls at your old precinct ... you should ask.

Steve,
My wife and I have been out of the country and have not registered to vote 
nor do we have absentee ballots to vote.  Any suggestions on how we can vote?
