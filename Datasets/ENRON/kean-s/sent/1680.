CalPERS - Rick Hayes - has set up a conf call next Thursday to discuss the 
California issue with Enron.  My asst took the call and indicated that Rick 
had 10 or so people within CalPERS who wanted to talk to us.  She is 
arranging for Rick and Marty (and myself) to be on that call.  I have 
requested a list of individuals and their role within PERS to distribute.  
Marty,  I will have my asst set up a meeting for you and me prior to Thursday 
to discuss the call.  

Let me know if you have any comments or questions or if anyone else would 
like to or should be included on the call.
