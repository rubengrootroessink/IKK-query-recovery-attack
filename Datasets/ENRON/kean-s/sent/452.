Apparently I spoke too soon.  Fourteen ideas were deposited into the 
ThinkBank today -- including entries from Frankfurt, Toronto, London and 
Pleasanton, California.  All levels of employees have participated from 
assistant to senior director.

Well, it seems that eThink has another hit.  Twelve people have already put 
well-conceived business ideas into the ThinkBank and we have received 
numerous congratulatory calls.  I won't have site hits until next week, but 
the active participation has been the highest of all our current applications 
on their respective launch day.

Have a great weekend,
Sarah.
