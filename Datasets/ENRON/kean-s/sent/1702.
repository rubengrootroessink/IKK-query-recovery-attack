Steve, Jeff will be in Europe on the date of this conference.  Is it worth 
joining and sending someone else ($25K sounds pretty steep to me, but 
everything is relative!).  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Subject: New Economy Conference with Senate Democrats


Mr. Skilling,

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and Senators Daschle,
Murray, Wyden, Leahy, Bingaman, Kerry, Baucus, Carnahan, Durbin, Dorgan and
Schumer are hosting a series of discussions on the future of the New Economy
in Beaver Creek, Colorado on March 2-4, 2001.  At this time, we have about
40 executives from venture capital, communications and other high tech
businesses attending the conference.  Most of those attendees joined the
DSCC's High Technology Council in 2000.

The Council was created last year in order to create a bridge between
Democratic Senators and key leaders of the New Economy.  Throughout 2000, we
hosted dinners, meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders and
Senators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issues
facing the nation.  As a result, the Senators and participants in the
Council were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facing
both government and business.  We hope that this effort has created a
foundation for strong, long-term relationships between the two groups.

The Conference in March is a continuation of last year's efforts, but we
will focus on a few of the key issues facing the New Economy to allow both
sides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of the
opportunities and problems we will face in the near future.

In order to attend, you would need to become a member of the DSCC's High
Tech Council by donating $25,000 to the DSCC.  That would make you eligible
to participate in a series of events, conferences and meetings this year
with other industry leaders and Democratic Senators.

I have attached an invitation to the event, a registration form and
information on becoming a member of the Council.  We have reserved only a
small number of rooms for new members of the DSCC's High Tech Council.  If
you would like to attend, please let me know as soon as possible and please
do not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions, concerns or for more
information.  I can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but I
am waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issues
they would like to discuss.  In your response, please let me know if you
have any particular issues that are of concern to you.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chad FitzGerald
Director - DSCC High Technology Council
