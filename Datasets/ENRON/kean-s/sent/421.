If you can cover it I would say yes.  It's a key race and we have been close 
to Ashcroft for years.  Let's make sure he knows we gave it.... we need to 
follow up with him.  Last time I talked to him he basically recited the 
utilities' position on electric restructuring.  Let's make it clear that we 
want to talk right after the election.

We have received a request from the Ashcroft Senate campaign for $10,000 in 
soft money. This is the race where Governor Carnahan is the challenger. Enron 
PAC has contributed $10,000 and Enron has also contributed $15,000 soft money 
in this campaign to Senator Ashcroft. Ken Lay has been personally interested 
in the Ashcroft campaign. Our polling information is that Ashcroft is 
currently leading 43 to 38 with an undecided of 19 percent. 

Do we want to make a further soft money contriubtion of $10,000?

Joe
