Toronto Hydro, Ontario Power Generation Launch EBT Express
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they=
=20
have launched an electronic business transaction (EBT) "hub" that will=20
provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services=20
to local distribution companies (LDCs) and energy retailers in Ontario.=20
Called EBT Express, the exchange will become operational when Ontario's=20
new competitive electricity market opens next spring. Excelergy eXACT=01v,=
=20
developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation, will=
=20
provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express.

ANALYSIS: This is a significant development, as EBT Express represents=20
the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions. The site will serve=
=20
as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data=
=20
among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario, and possibly=20
throughout=20
Canada.  I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur, Exelergy's=20
vice president, Canada, about EBT Express. Caraghiaur believes that the=20
site "will provide the essential technology for opening Ontario's electrici=
ty=20
market in an efficient manner." That is no small undertaking as there are=
=20
an expected 300 players that will need to communicate with each other in=20
Ontario once competition begins.

Deregulation is happening in Canada on a province-by-province basis (much=
=20
like it is happening state-by-state in the U.S.). Thus far, only Ontario=20
and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select=
=20
a new energy supplier. Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next=20
spring, and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be=20
operational.=20
Alberta uses a point-to-point transaction process, which represents a very=
=20
complex model. Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be=20
clearly seen, and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta=
=20
and elsewhere.

The Ontario Energy Board (OEB), which is the equivalent of a state PUC,=20
mandated the use of electronic business transactions (EBTs). The EBTs work=
=20
as follows: Once a customer selects a new energy supplier, the energy=20
supplier=20
and the local distribution company (LDC) must continue to share information=
=20
about that customer. This proprietary data, shared strictly on a one-to-one=
=20
basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only, will include billing,=
=20
usage and payment information. Essentially, an LDC will read the meter=20
and send usage information to the energy supplier, who will calculate its=
=20
portion of a customer's bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC,=20
which will submit the customer bill. This represents a common way for billi=
ng=20
in Ontario, although there are other options including consolidated billing=
=20
that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from=20
both the LDC and energy supplier. No customer information will be exchanged=
=20
until competition officially begins in Ontario, which now appears to be=20
in the spring of 2001, although the technology infrastructure supplied=20
by Excelergy is already in place.

In response to the OEB's mandate, Toronto Hydro Corp. and Ontario Power=20
Generation=01*the largest players in electricity distribution and generatio=
n=20
in Ontario=01* became equity partners in the $7.7 million joint venture to=
=20
create EBT Express. All customer data will be contained within EBT Express,=
=20
which is supported by the eXACT technology. Excelergy eXACT is a software=
=20
solution that translates, validates, manages and delivers data exchanged=20
among users. The functionality of eXACT has been used in several U.S. state=
s,=20
including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In fact, eXACT was introduced to=20
gas and electricity retailers in the United States in 1999 as a component=
=20
of Excelergy ABP=01v, a billing and customer information solution. Alleghen=
y=20
Energy Supply, a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, was one U.S. utility that=
=20
I know of that used the Excelergy technology.=20

Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci=
ng=20
the competitive market in Ontario. "There are presently 37 licensed retaile=
rs=20
in Ontario, 15 pending retailers and 246 LDCs," Caraghiaur told me. "You=20
can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between=20
all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express." The numbe=
r=20
of LDCs seemed awfully high to me, but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario=
=20
many LDCs serve only a small number of customers, often 100 customers or=20
less. This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in=20
Ontario but, when compared to the United States, Ontario still will have=20
a comparatively high number of distribution companies.=20

Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried=20
to assimilate communication among many market participants. Pennsylvania,=
=20
along with most other U.S. states, still uses electronic data interchange=
=20
(EDI) as its standard, wherein every LDC has a slightly different=20
interpretation=20
of data that is shared through the EDI. This can often cause communication=
=20
inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready=20
for deregulation. "EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards=
,"=20
says Caraghiaur. "The use of XML in particular will enhance communication=
=20
between market participants."

In fact, XML (extensible market language) is the cornerstone of eXACT as=20
it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but=20
still understood by different applications. Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg=
y=20
is on the forefront of XML technology, which was expressly stipulated in=20
the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy=
=20
Board. XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier=
=20
and more cost-effective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between=20
applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible.=
=20
In addition, Excelergy's eXACT software is object-oriented, allowing for=20
easy and rapid change from one program to another.=20

Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry.=20
Whereas states that previously deregulated, such as California and=20
Pennsylvania,=20
did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information, states=20
and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them.=
=20
For instance, Excelergy's competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse=
=20
built for the Midwest market. Also, the ERCOT-ISO has teamed with Andersen=
=20
Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling,=
=20
scheduled for pilot in the summer of 2001 and full market opening in Januar=
y=20
2002.

One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer=20
data through EBT Express, especially when it is backed by potential=20
competitors=20
in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power. Caraghiaur=
=20
responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer=
=20
information through an EBT structure. However, market participants are=20
not mandated to participate in EBT Express. They could opt to still exchang=
e=20
information on a point-to-point basis, although Caraghiaur believes that=20
EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer=
=20
data. In addition, Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive=
=20
information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC=20
and energy supplier involved in the exchange.

Interestingly, Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when=20
the Ontario market opens next year. Toronto Hydro Corp. owns Toronto=20
Hydro-Electric=20
System Limited, a regulated electricity distribution system, and Toronto=20
Hydro Energy Services, a competitive energy service company. Ontario Power=
=20
Generation is an electricity generating company, so Toronto Hydro and Ontar=
io=20
Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply=20
contracts=20
with lucrative customers. And rumor has it that venerable retail giant=20
Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada=20
next year. As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers,=
=20
Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market.
