Thanks for the update.  Any suggestions on anyone we might retain if this 
becomes a big "government to government" issue?

Steve
 With regard to Dabhol, Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status 
briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government - 
including DoEnergy, DOCommerce,DOState and DOTreasury.  The briefing was with 
staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand.   As the new 
administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will 
brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals.  I understand that Colin 
Powell has already been briefed on the situation  and I know the Ambasssador 
has been front and center on the issue.
 If we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals 
of the new administration at each of the  above agencies as well as the VP's 
office.  Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly.
 We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation - they are 
comfortable at this point.
 I am also getting the World Bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful 
and not a problem.  They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves 
if MSEB will view it has a help.  It is a sensitive issue because the Bank 
has historically been anti-Dabhol so I am taking it step by step.
 If you have any other questions just let me know.  thanks John
