My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant 
part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits 
reference.

Steve- can you have someone take a look at the attached article and give me 
your thoughts. There is a lot of information in there that I did not provide 
but they must be picking up from literature. Thanks, Rick

Subject:  Case Study  (Document link: James Lam)

Hi Rick,

Thank you again for spending time with Alan and me this week on the Enron case
study for my book.  Attached for your review is a draft that we put 
together.  I
think you will be happy with the tone and content of the case.  Otherwise,
please call me to discuss any changes you might have.

(See attached file: 17_Enron-am-jl.doc)

Note that the case makes reference to three charts that you said you would 
email
to me:

   Organizational chart of the RAC Group and summary descriptions (we will use
   this information to update this section of the case)
   Dashboard approval sheet (cartoon version)
   1-page flow chart of Board transaction approval process

Please provide these three charts and any changes you might have by Friday,
9/15.  Thanks.

Regards,
James
