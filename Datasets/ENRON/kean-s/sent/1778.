I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.  He is a very sharp guy and has 
a great deal of relevant government experience.  While I don't have a 
position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior 
positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an 
open position.

My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public 
Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.  I stressed to him 
that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could 
build to it over time.  His main concern was that he not get "lost in the 
system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.

I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come 
in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we 
can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels 
of the organization from time to time.
