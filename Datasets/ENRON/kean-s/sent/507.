Do we have a sense for how many we can reach, how many we can't and where 
they are?  Are whole offices (eg Tokyo) unreachable or is it only those who 
have home offices?

Mark and Steve- 

Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning 
BackWeb before we proceed.  As you can see from the Design Document, they are 
pretty significant.

Thanks,
 Courtney
