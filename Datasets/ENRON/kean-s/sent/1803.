Hello Steve,  I hope you and your family had a great holiday.  Steve, I heard 
on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as 
Alaskan Gas, ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane 
play.  I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes 
available.   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments 
made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind 
River Basins of Wyoming.  In addition, the Denver office of Enron North 
America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies.   Everything 
considered, the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves, including the 
gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR 
and will get gas to markets much sooner.  For example, Northern Border 
Partners expects to file at the FERC by the 3rd quarter of 2001 for the Bison 
Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in 2003 
(versus 2007 for Alaskan gas).  You can see the latest on the Bison project 
at Inside FERC, December 18th page 5.

One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane 
production, is the completion of an EIS  presently being prepared by the 
BLM.   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal 
acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and 
would assist gas in getting to market within Bush's first term in office.    
I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a 
priority item in the coming year !
