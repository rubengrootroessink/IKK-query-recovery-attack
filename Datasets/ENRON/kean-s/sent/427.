Thank you for agreeing to serve on the WorkLife Executive Council.  Please 
join Cindy Olson and myself for our first meeting, which is scheduled on 
Monday, October 30, from 2:00-3:30 p.m. in Conference Room EB-42c1.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to review and approve the WorkLife Executive 
Council Charter and general operations for the Council.  In addition, a 
presentation on Telecommuting and Sabbaticals will be provided for the 
Council's first consideration.  
An agenda and attachments will be forwarded to each of you for your review 
prior to the meeting on the 30th.  

Please RSVP your attendance to my assistant, SheriJordan, via email at
