		 Subject: eCompany Now Interviews

eCompany Now, a Fortune Magazine publication focused on e-business, is 
writing a feature on Enron.  The editor, Erick Schonfeld, will be in Houston 
on Friday, October 13 to conduct interviews.  The focus of the story is, once 
again, Enron's transformation to a new economy powerhouse and a successful 
eCommerce company.  

Erick is interested in your views on:
How Enron has evolved, both operationally and culturally, from a pipeline 
company to an e-business market maker
Your role in Enron's overall strategy 
Your vision for the future of your business 
Where you see Enron in the near future

The interview schedule is as follows:
  10-10:30 Tour - ENA 
  10:30-11:00 Greg Piper (clickpaper.com)
  11-12  Ken Rice (EBS)
  12-12:30 Tour - EBS
  2-3  Jeff Skilling (corporate overview)
  

I will bring Erick to your office at the scheduled time and will coordinate 
any follow-up inquiries.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Meredith
