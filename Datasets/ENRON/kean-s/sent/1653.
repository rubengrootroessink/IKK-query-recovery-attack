We move alot of people around Enron.  In fact, on an annual basis, we make 
about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at 
Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased 
productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston, 
moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused 
some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve 
later this year when we begin occupying the new building.

Steve:

The following question has been submitted for the upcoming all-employee 
meeting.  Could you provide an answer by noon this Friday?

Thanks.

Has Enron looked at the financial expense as well as the emotional, morale 
and business expenses associated with constantly moving people from one 
location to another in the Enron building?  Maybe we could use these savings 
and redirect them for our bonuses?
