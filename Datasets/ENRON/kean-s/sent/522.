Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a 
public hanging?  I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in 
front of people they will modulate their approach.

Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the 
hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we 
intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a 
solution that works for everybody.  Amen.
