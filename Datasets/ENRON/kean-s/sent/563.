I have a reception that evening (coincidentally with another Rice group -- 
from the engineering school), so I will not be able to attend.

Rice recruiting team,

As some of you are aware, Enron is sponsoring  sell weekends (Dec 1 and Dec 
8) for all the candidates that have received offers.  The Rice team is 
organizing a dinner for the Jones School candidates this Friday evening (Dec. 
1) at Tony Ruppe's.  I am looking for 5 to 8 Enron Jones School recruiters to 
attend the dinner on Friday.  

Please let me know if you will be able to attend.

Thanks,
Jaime
