While we don't need to do any lobbying on this bill, if anyone hears any 
information about chances for success it would be good to get the info to 
me.  Enron Wind has an interest in seeing this bill move forward.

Thanks,

Jim

Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue 
receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX 
47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for 
Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.

Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific 
legislators.  A significant PR push is planned.

SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One 
angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and 
make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.
