I talked to Ken Lay and he will support Carol as VP.  I have talked to Carol 
and she knows the process.  We are going to take her up at the next Excom 
meeting.  I don't think there is anything you need to do right now.

Any progress on determining how Carol would be accepted as a VP by the 
Executive Committee?    I have not been able to talk to her and am worried 
she might feel neglected.
