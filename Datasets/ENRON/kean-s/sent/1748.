We have rearranged the Mayor's schedule to hold the Houston Fire Chief
Selection Committee News Conference on Feb. 1 at 2 p.m.

Why don't we have lunch sometime next week to coordinate?

Hi Monette,

Regarding the press conference on the Houston Fire Chief selection
committee, I have only two possible dates that will work with Jeff
Skilling's calendar. February 1 is the preferred date, anytime after
1:30pm. Alternatively, February 2, anytime between 1:30pm and 3:30pm.

Let's touch base tomorrow and try to pencil in a date for the press
conference. Also, I don't have contact information for you...

Thanks,

Lisa
