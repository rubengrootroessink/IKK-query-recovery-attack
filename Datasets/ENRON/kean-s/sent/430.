Thanks for the resume.  I don't see a fit in government affairs, but I am 
forwarding to community relations to see if there is any interest there.

Steve,  

Ned Higgins fowarded this to me.  Evidently Kara's fiance is former ECT and 
has just moved to KMI.  She has responded to the TW job posting, but she 
might be a better fit somewhere else.  Thought you might want to look over 
the resume.

Mark
