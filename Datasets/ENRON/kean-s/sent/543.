Steve,

Thanks a lot for coming to class and talking to us on Tuesday.  
I think your presentation had a strong impact on Rice students, and many of 
them, including me, got a much better idea of Enron and its businesses.

I am not sure if you were going to distribute the copy of your presentation 
to us, but I certainly would consider it useful for my self-education about 
the company.
Let me know if I could possibly get a copy from you.

As I mentioned to you on Tuesday, I am starting full-time at Enron on the 
15th of January as a manager in Research Group, under Vince Kaminski.
I would like for us to go out for lunch sometime in January, if this is OK 
with you.

Sincerely,

Jason Sokolov
