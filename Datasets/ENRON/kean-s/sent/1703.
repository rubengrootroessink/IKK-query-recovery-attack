Steve,

Thank you for agreeing to speak at the ETS HR Conference.  Since we spoke 
last week, the meeting date has changed from February 20 to Monday, February 
26 to better accomodate presentors' and attendees schedules.  We have 
confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton.  On the 
26th, we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at 12:15 PM, followed 
by your presentation from 1:30-2:30 and Stan's from 2:30-3:30.  You are 
invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon 
as your schedule allows.

To follow up on our conversation last week, it would be great if you could 
talk to the group about Enron's performance in 2000, its successes and 
stumbles, and how ENE's stock price is impacted.  It would also be helpful if 
you could discuss the look of Enron in 2001, what its primary busninesses are 
and how they drive earnings; as well as what significant initiatives Enron 
has planned for 2001.  I have asked Stan to talk about ETS' performance 
during 2000, what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned.  He also 
will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enron's plans for 2001, as 
well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS' success this 
year.

Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR 
team.  I look forward to seeing you on February 26.

Gary
