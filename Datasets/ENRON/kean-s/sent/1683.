Mark:

I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing 
to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would 
be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) 
and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy).

I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to 
receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I 
would talk to the liquids traders.

Best regards,
Wolfgang
