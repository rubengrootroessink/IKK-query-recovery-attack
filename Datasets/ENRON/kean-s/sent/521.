Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.  I just 
wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the 
comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could 
have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for 
different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.  Scott 
Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.

I apologize if I offended anyone.  Please let them know that I was simply 
quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in  California.  Thanks for 
attributing the quote to me.  You did a great job at the hearing----it went 
decidely downhill after you left.

Best,
Jeff
