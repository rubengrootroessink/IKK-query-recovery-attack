Steve,

I haven't talked with you lately.  Hope that all is well.

Rumor on the street is that ENRON may completely reverse its position on
LMP and come our is support of the concept.  If so, this is very
significant.  It could affect the ability of various organizations to work
closely together.

Is there any truth to this rumor?

John Anderson, ELCON
