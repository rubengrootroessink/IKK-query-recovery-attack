 Dear Steve, 

I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning your perspective of the company.  You made it apparent that Enron is positioned to continue its tremendous success in the years to come, and I am very excited about the opportunities that the company offers.  Thanks again.

Sincerely,
