Mr. Kean:
Thank you for taking the time to interview me on Tuesday. I really am so
excited to be moving along in the recruiting process at Enron--almost as
excited as I'd be if I end up working there. I was wondering if you could
possibly offer me any advice for moving into the Super Saturday interview
weekend--advice about my own interview or anything that you think might be
helpful. I understand that you're very busy but know that your feedback
would be invaluable. If there is any additional information I
could provide about myself in the next couple of weeks, please don't
hesitate to call or e-mail.

Also, please tell your wife that if she is itching at all to see a little
women's college basketball this year (she can't still be fed up with it,
can she???), we have a great schedule! :)

Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Rigg
