Further information on Rice.  Given the outcome (read the following email as 
well) I didn't feel the need to involve anyone else.  Let me know if you 
disagree.

Thanks,

Brad,

The complaint that we have received from Rice regarding the Bremen circuit 
seems to be the result of a misunderstanding. In brief, this is what happened:

Rice is currently under contract with us to purchase  a Houston-Bremen 
circuit starting February 2002.  Initially the circuit was supposed to be on 
line February 2001 (last month), but at Rice's request, we bought back the 
circuit for the first 1 year.

We have recently been approached again by Rice to provide them with an 
interim circuit on the same route ASAP, and we have just submitted to them a 
termsheet in that regard.

Most likely, the misunderstanding came about as a result of repeated 
modifications of the starting date for the circuit, all of which were 
requested by Rice.  Again, our obligation under the existing contracts is to 
deliver the circuit February 2002, almost a year from now.

I discussed this problem with Brad Nebergall (origination), and he made a 
priority to explain the situation with the upper management at Rice.

thanks,
