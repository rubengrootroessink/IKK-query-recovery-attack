The Office of Pipeline Safety advised last evening that there have been at least two incidents in different areas of the country in which unauthorized individuals entered pipeline stations and appeared interested in manifolds and other pipeline facilities.  When confronted by pipeline employees, the individuals said they were lost and asked for directions.  Upon departing, the individuals did not follow the provided directions.  On one occasion, employees obtained the car license number, and the individual was detained by the FBI and is awaiting a deportation hearing.  Both of these events were reported to local FBI offices.  It is not known if the two events were connected.

OPS has asked to be advised as soon as possible of any similar intrusions or other unauthorized physical, photographic or electronic surveillance of pipeline facilities.  If you become aware of any such activities, please notify Corporate Security (x52804) immediately.

The FBI has extended its generic terrorist threat advisory through January 2, 2002, due to the continuing potential for terrorist attacks in the U.S.  The FBI urges continued vigilance during the seasonal holiday period.
