We may not want to have one third-party web-site, communicated, as:  it probably may not have all appropriate information; the web-site may discontinue updates; and would require additional communication to re-direct employee's attention.

I think we should recommend pushing people to our intranet site ( travel.enron.com ) .  This allows us to maintain the links and information flow, without maintaining the actual content.  Would this accomplish our goals?

The below information is already posted at travel.enron.com <http://travel.enron.com/>.  Please review, for your thoughts.

Thanks,

TR
