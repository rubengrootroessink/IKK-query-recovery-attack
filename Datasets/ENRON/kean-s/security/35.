Steve - below are the initial measures we believe we can take starting Wednesday.  The problem is guard force manpower.  The increased demands are so great now that the current force is working two 12 hour shifts instead of three 8 hour shifts.  We will be putting in a request for more guards in the next couple of days, but it takes 3 weeks for them to be hired and trained by the contractor.

Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit.  Also - would you like the email to come from you, the Office of the Chairman, or business controls?

Due to recent events, Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world.  As part of this increased security effort, beginning Wednesday morning, September 26, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and, where applicable, at other Enron facilities:

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building, a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer.

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility.  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders.

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building (U.S. 	driver's	 license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card.  Visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, 	or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Building.

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a 	visitor's log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  	At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees.
