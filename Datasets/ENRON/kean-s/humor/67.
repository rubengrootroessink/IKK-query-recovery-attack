The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.
