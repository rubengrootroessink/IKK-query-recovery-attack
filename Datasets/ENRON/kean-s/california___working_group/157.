Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if marked to market today).  Jim's got it , too.

Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.  Will give you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).

Best,
Jeff
