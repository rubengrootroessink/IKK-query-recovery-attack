Hi Steve -

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service.
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.
