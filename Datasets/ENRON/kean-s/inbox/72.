Steve, please have your admin make 8 1/2 x 11 copies
of the various sections of your benefits statement
and fax it to me.  I will look through it for possible
scenarios.

Regards,

David

Thanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional

offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas?
