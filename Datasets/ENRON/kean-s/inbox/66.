Steve and Maureen,

The note below deals with the conference at Stanford Steve is scheduled to participate in. In case it doesn't 'ring a bell', we discussed it briefly at the end of August.  The Conference is part of our 5 year Reasearch relationship with Stanford entitled "Globe".  The conference is set for January 23rd at Stanford.  There will be 2 Keynote speakers and 3 panels: "Global Ethics", "Global Brand" and "Global Growth";  Steve is part of The "Global Ethics" panel--it should be fairly easy and straight forward (as described below).  Steve, if you have changed your mind about participating, please let me know as soon as possible, so I can discuss it with Stanford.  If it works with your schedule, I agree with what Beth says below, and think it would be a very good opportunity for us, especially at this time.  Please let me know.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Christie,

Hello! I imagine you're quite busy, given all the changes going on at Enron.
I'm dropping you a line for a couple of reasons.  First, and most important,
I wanted to send along some good wishes during what I imagine is a difficult
time.  I hope you - and those around you - are coping well and that your
spirit is as strong and positive as ever.  

Second, I'm attaching the schedule for the January GLOBE conference.  Steve
Kean's panel will take place 11:15-12:30, which should allow him time to fly
in and out easily on the same day.  There's a lot of enthusiasm about his
participation, and I think this is a great time to have someone from Enron
in front of the MBAs.  He will be in good, and very empathetic company, as
Maria Eitel (NIKE) and Mads Ovlisen (Novo Nordisk) have both led their
companies through some difficult times, facing more than their share of
public scrutiny.  We are working with the panel moderator, David Brady, to
outline some specific questions that members of the panel might wish to
consider in preparing their remarks.  Our goal is to have each panelist
share their own company experiences - essentially sharing the ethical
challenges their company has faced as they've expanded globally across
different cultures and legal regimes. How have they balanced the
responsibility to make a profit with that of being a "good corporate
citizen" in places where corporate "citizenship" may mean very different
things?   Again, each speaker will have approximately ten minutes each in
which to relay their experiences, after which, the moderate will ask some
questions and then ultimately open it up for audience questions.  

As I hope is evident, we are quite excited that Steve is taking part in the
conference.  I will plan to send you the topic outline shortly after the
Thanksgiving holiday.  Please let me know if you'd prefer that I send it to
Steve directly; otherwise I will continue to send information through you.

All the best,
