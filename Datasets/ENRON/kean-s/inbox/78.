Here is something close to the note I wrote for Cindy in the meeting.  I think we can advocate consistency as an employee advocacy issue.  If we think the HR department can make this happen without a note, great. 

TO: Management Committee

As you know, we have announced broadly that restructuring activities are imminent.  

At this sensitive time, it is fair and right to employees to communicate consistently across the company in a coordinated fashion.  Therefore, please ask your management teams to refrain from speculating about specific reductions or communicating preliminary information to their people.  This creates a situation where there are have's and have not's -- those with information (preliminary at best), and those who are left anxious and wondering why they've heard nothing.

As promised, we will have a coordinated communication -- which will include you -- when plans are finalized.  In the meantime, let's do everything we can to avoid creating additional angst for employees.

Thanks for your leadership in this difficult time.
