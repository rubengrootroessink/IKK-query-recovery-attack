Hi Mark and Beth 

Attached are the following: 

1. Draft comments re: the 401K plan -- NOTE: they have not been approved by legal; 
2. A Dow Jones story alleging that the recent lawsuit could allow: i) Dynegy to back away from the deal; ii) creates the implication that the suit adds financial pressure; iii) it also erroneously (I believe) discusses the time frame of the lock down period

WE SHOULD: Consider a well orchestrated leak regarding the fact that these suits are bogus -- the leak would include information on:

?       Enron had been contemplating a change in plan administrators since 1997.  Plans were stalled due to a moratorium on administrator changes as a condition of the PGE acquisition.

?       Enron requested proposals from alternate plan administrators in February of 2001 -- in writing. 
?       In May of 2001, the new administrator (Hewitt) was notified - in writing - of our intent to start our business relationship beginning in October of 2001.   

?       The transition period (when employees could not sell stock), ran from only October 26th to November 13th - a shorter time span than was originally planned.

?       During the transition period Enron's stock went from $15.40 to $9.98 - while we're not happy about the reduced share price, the magnitude of the decline during the lock down period is much smaller than the drop alleged by some plaintiffs attorneys.

?       401K participants have the option to choose between [17] different stocks, including Enron.
