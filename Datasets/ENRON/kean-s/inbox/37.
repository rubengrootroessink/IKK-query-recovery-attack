Steve - 

Question has come my way regarding bus - mass transit subsidy for '02.  Employees want to be sure they will not need to set aside pre-tax $, via open enrollment now in place, to cover anything less than 100% bus subsidy.

Currently (and throughout '01) Enron subsidizes bus passes to employees @ 100% of cost.  This will be a $2.5 mill. expense in '02.  

During budget cycle several months ago it was discussed that Enron could cut this expense in half if subsidy was capped at $50/mo. - same as Parking subsidy.

My records show this was not accepted and we plan to continue with 100% subsidy next year.

Just checking if you.  Given temper of average employee today, I assume this is still the right decision.
