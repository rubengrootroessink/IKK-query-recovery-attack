water, and telecommunications industries with actionable ideas and 
proven enhancement techniques.

Our cover article features BellSouth's new e-billing service Learn 
how BellSouth's Web site has evolved from brochureware to online 
ordering, bill preview and payment.

integrated quality monitoring with an e-learning product from Witness

the appropriate e-learning modules at their desktops.

CSQ also features an article on recent advances in powerline carrier 
telecommunications. Utility customers in Germany and other parts of 
Europe are now receiving broadband Internet services through their 
electricity sockets. This technology could be the bridge for rural 
America's "digital divide."
