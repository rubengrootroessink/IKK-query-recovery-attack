 Atlanta Airport Evacuated Because of Breach
ATLANTA (AP) - Authorities halted departing flights at Atlanta's airport and evacuated people from the concourses Friday after a man ran through a security checkpoint and jumped on a terminal train.
The Federal Aviation Administration stopped all departures at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and planes in other cities going to Atlanta were told to remain on the ground, FAA spokesman Christopher White said.
All the passengers and employees in the concourses were cleared and sent to the main baggage pickup area.
Some planes were allowed to land, but none could take off, White said.
Airport police were pursuing the man. "It's still unfolding," Delta spokesman Peggy Estes said.It was unclear when air traffic would restart at the airport.
At this point airlines are diverting their flights according to location of nearest city.
