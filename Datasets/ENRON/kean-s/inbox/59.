During a news conference held late on 29 October, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that intelligence sources have found "credible" information that the U.S. could be the focus for some sort of terrorist attacks within the week.  Ashcroft said the information received was not specific as to target or date of attack, but was of sufficient credibility  to warrant sharing with the public. He further called on law enforcement agencies, citizens and U.S. interests abroad to be on "highest alert."   
Although no specific targets were mentioned, various federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, FAA, FBI and DOT have been alerted. 
Effective immediately, and until further notice, DOE and NNSA have mandated that all activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks. Changes in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented. 
DOE and NNSA strongly suggest that the energy industry also implement these actions and to be on alert for any suspicious activities.

We will keep you informed of any new information as it is received.
