Calif EOB Official Says ISO, PX `Don't Get It'

   LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The executive director of California's
Electricity Oversight Board stressed to the state's Power Exchange and
Independent System Operator to   provide detailed information to the state
agency before making changes to their market structure.   

In an e-mail obtained by Dow Jones Newswires and sent Monday to ISO and CalPX 
officials, EOB executive director Gary Heath wrote he was unaware that the 
ISO had engaged in a new "seasonal super peak day of market" to purchase 
forward power Tuesday from Santa Clara-based Automated Power Exchange. 
The CalPX and APX have developed a proposal that would allow its customers to 
power in hour blocks directly to the ISO weekdays. 
The ISO had filed with federal regulators last week seeking authority to make 
such purchases, but apparently the Electricity Oversight Board was left in 
the dark. 
"No one seems to get it," reads the email written by Heath and sent to ISO 
and PX officials. "No more surprises from the ISO, PX, etc. This is not the 
time to change any procedures without notice to the EOB... you file with the 
(Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) seeking approval of the ISO's ability 
to buy in forwards and you have no sense to run this by the state before you 
file..." 
"We are in troubling times," Heath's e-mail states. "Both corporations must 
begin to realize that what was created by the state can be undone." 
Neither of the parties mentioned in the e-mail would comment on the issues. 
The ISO and PX are currently the target of a state audit spearheaded by state 
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who believes merging the two corporations will 
help California's troubled deregulated market work better for consumers. Sen. 
Peace, in past interviews, has threatened to dismantle the current ISO 
structure and have the EOB control the ISO markets. 
Heath also wrote his board was upset that the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration has managed to save California from rolling blackouts, 
referred to as a stage three emergency, "at the last minute." 
"I've got the administration on my butt wanting to know what's going on with 
BPA and we can't get a straight answer from the ISO... no more BS from the 
ISO," the e-mail states. 
Furthermore, Heath stated the ISO must run any proposed changes or additions 
to its market structure before the EOB before filing with federal regulators 
as well as providing the EOB information on power plant outages. 
"When we ask for information on outages... I expect the ISO to fully disclose 
to us," the e-mail says. "The ISO&PX are quick to make market rule changes 
but are too reluctant to make changes in your disclosure of information/data 
to the state."
