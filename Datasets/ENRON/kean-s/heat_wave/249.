Rob -- This info is great.  For use w/ the media, we'll need to simplify, and 
it would be helpful to have specific examples of what a utility would pay and 
the overall result of a market with price caps, the current "open" market 
(under ISO regulation, buying from the PX) and a pure open market (using 
hedges to manage risk).  

thx.

Here is a one pager on the general problem of price regulation.  Next we will 
need to discuss the particular cases and identify specific distortions, which 
the field people will have to provide.

Rob --

I think this is a great start for the outline of policy reasons against price 
caps.  If possible, let's run it by PR to see what more structure they want.

See if this is of use and whether I need to do more.

I hope it sets a framework from which the specifics of the price cap examples 
and distortions can be added.
