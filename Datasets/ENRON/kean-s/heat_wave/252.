In case you have not seen, attached is a copy of a speech Steve Peace gave on 
energy
supply.  Also:

*  I spoke with Tom Riley, UC/CSU account manager, and he has a conference 
call with
the customer tomorrow.  He feels very confident that UC/CSU San Diego will 
jump on this
issue.  We need to discuss how we want to use them and when.  Obviously the 
sooner,
the better.

* I have not heard back from The New Power Company, but Dennis has a pricing 
plan if they
are willing to move forward.  I have left a message with Lou to determine 
what his thoughts are
and should hear back tonight.

* I'm still waiting for a list of three residential customers that may be 
willing to talk, as well as
other San Diego based businesses.
