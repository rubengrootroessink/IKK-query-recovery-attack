Sarah --

Can you please set up a call to discuss the following?

1. EPSA / FERC Meeting.

The Aug 24 FERC meeting and Enron's participation?  I hope that you, Mary 
Hain and Jeff Dasovich will be able to attend.  This is pretty important and 
we need to make sure that we have the issues outlined well.

2. CA meeting with Scott Miller.

Also, can we meet with Scott Miller while he is in California?  Do we need 
get on his schedule?  Messages we want delivered?  Can we find out who he is 
meeting with?

3. CA ISO Information.

Finally, we need more information from the CA ISO to handle the upcoming AG 
investigation.  Is Scott Miller getting information from the CA ISO that we 
can't get?  Mary, what information is public and what is confidential.  I was 
wondering if we needed to ask FERC to order more information into the public 
domain to undertake the investigation.  The AG will be getting the 
information, so why not get it first?  Also, why not leverage this 
investigation into asking for more information from the CA ISO (including the 
list Jeff D. put together earlier)?  

Jim

Subject: EPSA Marketer Conf. Call

1.  EPSA/Boston Pacific Statistical Analysis 

Boston Pacific plans to be done with the analysis by second week in September.

EPSA proposes holding a call next Friday (Aug. 25) afternoon with Craig Roach 
to discuss Craig's approach for the analysis.

2.  California 

Scott Miller (FERC) is in California now meeting with people -- pressure on 
FERC continues to be increased

Discussed proposed rate freeze

3.  FERC Investigation (see today's Energy Daily Article)  -- Concern that 
FERC is under pressure to do something -- shots being taken at FERC and Scott 
Miller to do more than just visit California with FERC auditors

two meetings next week Aug. 23 and Aug. 24 -- generators in on Aug. 23, 
marketers on Aug. 24 -- to discuss California
FERC will have additional meetings on other areas of country later
EPSA plans to have a working lunch on Thursday before the meeting at FERC -- 
meeting at FERC 2:00 - 4:00
 We need to confirm with EPSA if we're planning on attending
I suggested EPSA have a pre-meeting so that we have a united front
 EPSA will hold a conference call on Tuesday 11:00 am EDT with the entire 
group (both generators   and marketers) to work on our presentation, and then 
we may decide to begin meetings (as   necessary) on Wednesday (for 
generators) or Thursday (for marketers) morning prior to the FERC  meetings
Scott told Mark that there is pressure on his group to come up with their 
fact findings (at least on California) prior to November 1

4.  TPC Paper

EPSA asked if anyone has questions, has everyone gotten through the document.

PECO Power Team (new member) says this paper goes a step further than the 
EPSA paper -- while PECO is very comfortable with the EPSA paper, they are 
very uncomfortable with the TPC -- more strident and takes positions that 
PECO could not support
Dynegy person asks is this tying in with the coalitions working in the 
individual regional RTO negotiations.  Mark said no.  Julie says its not 
supposed to be responsive to one RTO proposal -- SPP, Midwest, etc.
Duke has not yet read the paper -- everyone decided to hold off discussions 
to the next call

5.  Elcon holding transmission customer meetings to plan for upcoming NERC 
meetings.  Charles Yeung is active in  this.

6.  Louisiana PSC Technical Conference

EPSA cannot participate in this technical conference being held on August 29 
-- the EPSA summit is that day in Chicago

7.  No conference call next week --
