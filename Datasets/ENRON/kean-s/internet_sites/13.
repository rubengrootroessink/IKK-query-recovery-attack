Bob - the WinInstall is available for all EES users. I will have David follow 
up with these users.

David - please send Steve & Maureen an e-mail with details of how they can 
install IPTV.

Thanks,

Michael

Arshak, It appears the Steve and Maureen log into the EES domain.  I have 
cc'd Michael Slayton who would be able to assist them with getting the IPTV 
client on their computer.  I called Maureen and left her a voice mail in this 
regard.

Michael call Chris Bowling if you need any assistance with this.
