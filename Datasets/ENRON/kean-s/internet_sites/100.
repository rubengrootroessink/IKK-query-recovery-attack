Hi,

Here is our access through Nov 19th to S&P....

www.standardandpoors.com/ratingsdirect

Userid: ERN_G9_CORNEIROE
Password: RATINGS123

only one person may be logged into this at one time...and several of us are using it for research right now....so if we are logged
in...call me at 3-3528 and we'll get out of it.

Likewise, once you research any articles, please exit immediately so that one of us may access it as well.

Many thanks
David
