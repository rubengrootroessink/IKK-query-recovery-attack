 Clean Air/NOx Briefing for ENA:  On Monday 8/28, Environmental Strategies 
held a detailed briefing on Clean Air/NOx regulations for the ENA East Power 
Desk, which resulted in several ongoing projects.   Over 40 people, including 
Kevin Presto (head of trading), almost all the traders, all analysts, and all 
fundimentals (IT, information) staff were in attendance.    Mary Schoen 
pulled the presentation together and addressed financial impacts of the 
regulations on power markets. Jeff Keeler gave background, history, and 
future timelines regarding NOx and other air regulation.   Gus Egnheim and 
Marc Phillips  assisted with technical questions related to control 
technologies.   The meeting  concluded with a discussion of strategy going 
forward, and a project to assist ENA in a detailed analysis of the effects on 
power plants and markets in the NOx SIP Call states.   Kevin Presto (who is 
also responsible for running the peakers) indicated that it may be more 
preferable to sacrifice some of our peaker interests and develop a strategy 
that supports state and EPA efforts that increase costs as much as possible 
on our competitors.   This will be an ongoing strategic effort  to add value 
to ENA.

   Texas Renewable Energy Credit Comments:  Enron led a group of companies 
that generate, trade and market renewable energy and environmental advocates 
in filing joint comments on issues related to the implementation of a 
Renewable Energy Credit ("REC") trading program in Texas.  Stacey Bolton  led 
drafting efforts on behalf of the group, and worked within Enron to 
coordinate our positions.  The program is consistent with positions we've 
taken, in that attributes of energy can be traded separately from its energy 
source.    The group recommended changes that would lead to consistency and 
adaptability, including comments about what information should be included on 
the credit's "label" and a recommendation that any environmental disclosure 
requirements be developed in conjunction with the REC trading protocol.

Pipeline Safety:   We continue to monitor the legislative climate following 
the tragic El Paso pipeline eruption and fire in Carlsbad, NM, in which 10 
people were killed.    While the widely-held perception among industry is 
that the accident will have a negative effect on the legislation, information 
from Capitol Hill continues to indicate that the legislation will not likely 
become more burdensome -- there is just a greater likelihood that it will 
receive attention and an effort will be made to pass something this 
Congress.   It is expected that the full Senate may act in the two weeks 
after Labor Day weekend, but that the House still may not be ready to move 
legislation through committee and to the House floor until later in 
September.  INGAA is recommending hiring an outside lobbying firm to assist 
in efforts going forward, due to the thought that many companies will not 
want to be active or visible in lobbying this issue because of the El Paso 
accident.  Jeff  Keeler will investigate the climate on Capitol Hill further 
before Enron signs off on this strategy.   In addition, Stan Horton will be 
in DC the week of 9/5 to attend meetings at DOE and Dept. of Treasury, to 
talk about the possible impacts of the accident on energy markets and the 
economy.   

In addition to advising GPG, we have been providing information and analysis 
to ENA Competitive Analysis, who is advising ENA management on the effects of 
this legislation on gas and power markets, so that we may take advantage of 
opportunities that arise.

 Climate Change:   Jeff  Keeler has been providing information on various 
climate change proposals to Enron South America, who will be engaging in a 
dialogue with Brazilian environmental regulators over Enron's involvement or 
interest in Joint Implementation and Emissions Trading programs.

correction of the Texas SIP.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb was not able to participate in the conference call this 
week.  Mid-September is key date after which work on the compressor stations 
is expected to begin in earnest.

Cuiaba Pipeline - Joe Kolb is trying to contact David Runte to verify 
information in the monthly report and is currently planning a trip to Bolivia 
with Edgar Zuleta to inspect and review project-related issues first hand. 

Construction BMPs - Bob Moss has not heard received any comments from Jerry 
Martin or his staff.  Regarding the fiber optic component of the BMPs, Joe 
Kolb has not been able to discuss the project with Herb Caballero.   Bill 
Osborne has distributed the pipeline BMPs to Shafer, Ryther, and Steenberg 
for their comments.  He hopes to get their feedback this week and then take 
it on to others within GPG.

Greenfield Risk Mangement Project - Documents that lay out sequence of 
environmental aspects of major capital project development are nearly 
complete.  The one for GPG is being reviewed by Bill Osborne.

Recycling Committee -  Wayne Lei has sent info on PGE's recycling program, 
which Joe Kolb provided to David  Ronkainen.  Joe Kolb conducted an informal  
small energy conservation survey on 3AC 15 and found that 53% of the 36 
office credenza lights and 35% of the 110 cubicle lights were left burning, 
plus 3 computers, 1 radio and 1 fan.  If we decide to promote energy 
conservation in our downtown offices, the impact should be something that can 
be estimated by doing before and after surveys on a few floors.

Isagen Privatization, Colombia - Don Stevens provided an environmental due 
diligence scope of work to Mario Brunasso, Development Engineering, who will 
forward it to a local engineering consulting firm.  Due to high security 
risk, Enron has elected to hire Harza for the full scope of the due 
diligence.  The privatization includes hydro and thermal generation and 
transmission, accounting for over 30% of Colombia's energy supply.

Project Dragon, Asia - The Environmental Schedule of the Share Purchase 
Agreement was circulated for review by Bruce Lundstrom, APAChi Legal.  Copies 
were forwarded to Frank Smith for comment.  The lenders have begun their due 
diligence in Hong Kong and key discipline leaders are on standby to answer 
questions.  A TransitionsTeam may be deployed in October/November.  This deal 
is still very confidential and Enron Asia power plants and personnel do not 
know anything.

ENEL, Nicaragua - Don Stevens has requested Ramiro Garcia to review proposed 
legislation for Nicaragua to assist in the evaluation of its potential 
impact.  The proposal is very stringent and does not have much chance of 
success; however, Enron has learned some of the other bidders are addressing 
capital costs associated with the potential requirements.  The bid date is 
October 12.

Annual Report - Many technical and management problems have plagued the Image 
Center's pdf of the Annual Report.  Gavin Dillingham succeeded in the posting 
and publication of the final edition.  Hard copies will likely be ready next 
Friday for distribution to Executive Staff.

Valuation Exercise - Susan, Henry, Jeff, and Marc all provided input on the 
EHS value to Enron exercise.  An additional meeting was held with Gia to 
explain some of the tasks.

EES/Eli Lilly Deal - Susan Worthen participated in several meetings with both 
EES and Eli Lilly to learn more about the scope of services and EES' EHS 
management system.  A more detailed meeting with EES's Enron Building 
Services Inc. group will be held next week.  An EHS briefing has been 
scheduled for September 13 to answer Eli Lilly's environmental due diligence 
questions.
