Mike Terraso asked me to send you some information relating to the timing a=
nd the potential process of the Clean Water Act Section 308 information req=
uest sent from EPA Washington to Enron Corp. As Mike likely mentioned, the =
request seeks information regarding "discharges" and "releases" of "oil" fr=
om pipeline facilities since July 1998. Although the information request wa=
s addressed to Enron Corp., we believe the EPA's focus should be on the EOT=
T pipeline system. We shared these and other thoughts with the agency when =
we met last week in Washington D.C. We hope to hear back from EPA soon rega=
rding clarification/resolution of several issues discussed during the meeti=
ng (e.g., whether a response solely from EOTT is sufficient at this time). =
=20

TIMING -- Enron Corp. received the information request on July 7, 2001. We =
requested and received a 90-day extension from the agency, thereby making o=
ur response due on November 7, 2001. The agency likely will require a consi=
derable amount of time to review our response because we will report a fair=
ly significant number of discharges/releases, which will be accompanied by =
a large number of responsive documents. It is unlikely that the agency will=
 begin a serious review of our response until sometime following the 2001 h=
oliday season. Based on our meeting in Washington, we do not expect a quick=
 response in 2002 because the Water Enforcement Division has an extremely b=
usy agenda and a small staff, which likely will preclude them from focusing=
 solely on our response. In addition, we know that the agency sent out a si=
milar information request to the Williams Companies. Thus, we do not expect=
 a response from EPA until late spring-mid summer of 2002 at the earliest.

PROCESS -- After we submit our response to the information request, EPA cou=
ld respond in several ways:

(1) The agency could request a meeting to discuss the materials submitted o=
n November 7, 2001 or send out another request seeking additional informati=
on. We will be prepared to respond to any such request. (This is a fairly l=
ikely scenario)

(2) Either before or after requesting additional information, EPA could iss=
ue a notice of violation and begin some type of administrative enforcement =
action. This could take the form of a compliance order and administrative c=
ivil penalty (all internal to the agency) or a consent decree with an order=
 entered by a federal court. An order could include a fine, required pipeli=
ne maintenance activities, and/or stipulated penalties for future discharge=
s or releases. Although the differences with our situation appear to be sig=
nificant, EPA recently settled an enforcement action with Koch Industries f=
or oil spills from its pipeline system for $30 million. Under an enforcemen=
t action, we would attempt to negotiate the terms of the order with the age=
ncy and hopefully minimize the size of any proposed fine. We also believe t=
hat our actions (principally those of ETS as operator of the EOTT pipeline =
system) between now and the time of the agency's response will be helpful i=
n attempting to mitigate any fine or course of action proposed by the agenc=
y. (This is also a fairly likely scenario)

(3) If our response is particularly troublesome to EPA, the agency could tu=
rn the matter over to the Department of Justice. Before this scenario would=
 unfold; however, the agency likely would conduct additional inquiries (e.g=
., more focused information requests and employee interviews). This scenari=
o would be most problematic because it likely would unfold only if the gove=
rnment (EPA and DOJ) consider the alleged violations extremely serious and =
possibly systematic. (Although possible, this is a less likely scenario)
