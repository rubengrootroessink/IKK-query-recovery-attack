COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE & BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

California Power Development -- NEPA Review -  Jeff Keeler and Mary Schoen held a meeting with EWS/ENA West power developers to discuss a proposed project in Roseville, CA.   Since the project must connect to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) through a substation, WAPA is suggesting that it may need to perform not only a NEPA analysis from the Enron project to the substation, but on the entire WAPA grid, due to NEPA's mandate to analyze "all downstream impact."   Jeff and Mary are working on strategies to determine:  1) if it is legally feasible to conduct NEPA review just for the Enron project portion so that Cal. Energy Commission process is not delayed and 2)  if agencies involved in NEPA review will comply with Bush executive orders mandating expedited review of power project permit applications.
