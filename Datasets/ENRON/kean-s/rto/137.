There were four major filings last week in the Midwest market.  These include the final compliance filings on rates, terms and conditions as well as the business plan for ARTO proposing National Grid as the Managing Member.  Attached are some ideas of the needed Enron responses - protests/comments and also very brief summaries of some of the filings.

We still can't get the Alliance filing made last Friday, not yet on the website or RIMS.  I will add to this when we get that filing and have time for a preliminary review.

The Midwest group will be initiating meetings to get further guidance on these possible protests/comments.
