Karen, et. al., 

	As I explained a couple of weeks ago, I was asked to write "Pro RTO" article for a magazine called Oregon Futures.  The request came to me by way of Portland General and Paul Kaufman.  The article is due to the magazine by August 27th.  Will you please provide suggestions or changes at your earliest convenience.  I will be in the office only until next Tuesday, so we have the article ready for submission by August 21st.  Thanks for your help.

Steve
