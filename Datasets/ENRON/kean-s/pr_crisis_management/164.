There have been 6 small ENW employee meetings over the past week.  I attended each of them and have compiled a set of notes from each meeting.  The meetings have been a cross section of questions from employees, recap of what's going on and concerns from employees.  While we have only been able to meet with slightly over 100 employees, these employees represent a significant cross-section of Net Works and most have a large number of employees under them and were speaking for their employees in their comments.

Four of the meetings were led by Greg Piper, Sally Beck and Mark Pickering.  One of those four included Mark Frevert and the other two were led by Mark Frevert.  The attendees are noted before the recap of each meeting.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.

Eric
