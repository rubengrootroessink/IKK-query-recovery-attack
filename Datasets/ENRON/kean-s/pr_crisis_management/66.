FYI -- The following internal statement was sent out this morning to all staff in Europe/Japan/Australia.  We are on standby to prepare any further announcement(s) that may need to be sent out to staff, but at this juncture we do not anticipate any additional updates will be sent out today.  

Alex Parsons is working with Richard Lewis and his team to flesh out an internal Q&A, etc. so that we are prepared for reactive purposes regarding the commercial operations of the plant -- more information to follow on this front as soon as it is available.

Further, the media statement which was distributed to members of the press this morning at 07:45 has been posted on the European website:  www.europe.enron.com

Thanks,
Fiona

TEESSIDE POWER STATION INCIDENT UPDATE

UPDATE 9 AUGUST, 2001

Teesside Power Station remains off line today following the tragic incident yesterday, which claimed the life of a third Enron employee overnight.

Two other members of staff died at the scene and a fourth remains in hospital in a stable condition. 

Our priority is to offer all possible support to the families of these employees and a support team has spent some time with them. Any help and assistance which can be given will continue to be offered over the coming days and weeks.

Steps are being taken to support friends and colleagues throughout the company and Enron's Chief Executive Officer in the United States, Jeff Skilling, has flown to the region to meet with staff today.

Meanwhile, Enron is co-operating fully with all the appropriate authorities - including the Health and Safety Executive - in an attempt to establish what caused the incident.

No decision will be taken for several days regarding future operation of the plant.

More information will be provided as soon as it becomes available.

The Public Relations department is handling all media enquires. Should you receive any enquiries about the incident they should be directed to 0207 783 4004.
