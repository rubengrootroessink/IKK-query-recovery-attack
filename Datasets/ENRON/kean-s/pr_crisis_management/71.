All,

Further to my earlier email, I thought the following information would be of use to you:

1)  Jeff Skilling and Tim Underdown held a short press briefing at 12.30pm this afternoon -- a transcript from the briefing has been posted on the European website ( www.europe.enron.com ) and a quick, simple note is being circulated to staff in Europe, Japan and Australia advising them how to access the transcript.

2) Paul Lund with Standard & Poors' Infrastructure Financing Ratings division contacted us to advise S&P plan to issue a statement on Teesside Power Finance Limited this afternoon regarding the situation at Teesside power station.  We have run the statement by Richard Lewis and Legal and are requesting two minor changes be made before it is released, but in principle the statement is accurate and we have no issues with it.  See attached amended document: 
 
3) In terms of enquiries that are coming in to us on the commercial viability of the plant, we have agreed with Richard Lewis that we will not enter into any discussions of this nature.  Our focus as a company is on supporting the friends and family of the victims and to cooperate with the investigation into the cause of the explosion -- not to comment on the commercial impact of the plant being off line.

4) Finally, we expect to be in a position to release the names of the four employees tomorrow once they have been formally identified.  We are hoping that the Health and Safety Executive will be able to release, at a minimum, its preliminary findings by early next week at the latest.  More information to follow on both issues.
