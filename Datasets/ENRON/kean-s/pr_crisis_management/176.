Cheryl-  Here you go.  This the draft QA document we had planned to post on the web, however, WIlmer Cutler is going to take another pass at this later today.

Thanks-
Meredith

Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft.  
Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it.

In preparation for this Friday's Bank Meeting, we are in need of a comprehensive Question & Answer List for the Q & A session at the end of our presentation.  If you have such a list right now, could we use that as a basis for ours? Cheryl Lipshutz is spearheading our efforts.

The Bank Meeting is still scheduled for this Friday at the Hyatt, beginning at 8:00 a.m. and all of you are encouraged to attend.
