Thanks Eric -- 

Everyone, Steve wanted to be sure that we had an updated, confirmed affirmative statement with regard to commercial activity.  There have been some recent affirmations by specific counterparties, but we are probably safer staying with broad statements in light of the fluctuating situation.

I'm not sure if this what you are looking for or not...feel free to modify as needed.  Thanks.

In our wholesale natural gas and power markets, which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity, our customer base continues to have complete confidence in Enron as the market maker of choice.  Our customers are not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes continue to experience above-normal activity levels for both transactions and notional value.  The 30-day rolling average of daily transactions is at an all-time high of over 5,800 transactions per day with an average notional value of nearly $3 billion.
