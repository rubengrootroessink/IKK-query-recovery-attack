MOODY'S PLACES ALL LONG TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF ENRON CORP ON REVIEW FOR
DOWNGRADE; SENIOR UNSECURED AT Baa1

Approximately $ 13 Billion of Debt Securities Affected.


New York, October 29, 2001 -- Moody's Investors Service placed all the
long term debt obligations of Enron on review for downgrade following the
announcement by Enron of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting
substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. These
actions affect Enron's broadband operations, its merchant portfolio and
the Azurix water company holdings. The company's Prime-2 rating for
commercial paper is confirmed.

Moody's has previously commented on the challenges impacting a number of
Enron's businesses but the magnitude of the announced charges will reduce
Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat
over 50.0% while slashing earnings. The company's previously announced
sale of Portland General, however, will result in cash proceeds
approximating $1.8 billion which management is earmarking for debt
reduction. In addition, the sale will remove approximately $1 billion of
debt obligations from Enron's balance sheet. Moody's notes that, while
this transaction will go a long way to help restore Enron's balance
sheet, it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year
to complete.

In its review, Moody's will focus on Enron's strategic direction and in
particular on the earnings and cash flow outlook for its core gas and
power wholesale businesses. We will also review management's progress in
dealing with problem areas such as its exposure to the California energy
markets and its Dhabol project in India. In addition, Moody's will
analyze further restructuring efforts and the potential for further asset
write-downs as well as for future asset sales that can generate cash for
debt reduction.
