I am putting together a comprehensive contact list, but in the interim I wa=
nted to flag two contacts for you to tuck away in your pocket.  I have met =
and spent time with the CEO of S&P.  I know him through Michael Lewan, one =
of our DC consultants.  You may know of that S&P is owned by McGraw Hill.  =
Michael Lewan gave the "Steve Kean" (and #3) of McGraw Hill his very first =
job in life.  Glenn then introduced me to the CEO of S&P, Leo O'Neill.  Leo=
 is a very approachable person who readily made acquaintances with me b/c o=
f his great fondness for Bob Rubin and Michael Lewan.  Leo told me several =
stories of how he always "thinks better of" the CEOs who sit down with him =
and engage in honest conversation when S&P is evaluating its ratings of a c=
ompany.  That is how Leo got to know Bob; Leo was very impressed with how B=
ob acted when S&P was contemplating action against Goldman Sachs many years=
 ago.  Second, the recently resigned Head of Enforcement of the SEC is a fr=
iend from my gym.  For several years I spent most mornings with him as we s=
hared the same personal trainer.  I am sure Richard hired most if not all o=
f the current SEC enforcement staff.  I am not sure where Richard landed up=
on his departure, as he wanted to just take time off before starting his ne=
xt career.  These two contacts are small, but thought you might want to inc=
lude them in your thinking.  Hope all is well.
