Steve-

The following are the key Deans and Administrators with whom I work.  There are other relationships at these schools so please let me know what your needs are so I can be of better assistance.

If you would like to make contact with these individuals, I would like to be involved, personally, as these relationships, although business, have been very personally cultivated and any interaction on behalf of Enron will be better served with a personal touch.  As it is, I have been in regular contact with these folks over the recent weeks.

Additionally, given the recent history we have had with these institutions and individuals (first telling them everything is A-OK and a month later telling them recruiting, funding and all relationship activities are indefinitely on hold), I would suggest we proceed cautiously with regard to any requests we make of them. 

Let me know if there is anything else I can do to be of assistance.
