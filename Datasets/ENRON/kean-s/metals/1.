Dear Steve, 

We have not forgotten your request for some metals info! Michael has 
suggested that a recent presentation he made on IPTV to Enron Europe might 
help you. The power point presentation is attached although I don't know 
where to find any video footage of the presentation.

Please call to discuss and see what else you need.

Best regards
