On Wednesday afternoon Azurix delivered a 45 day "cure" letter to the governor of Buenos Aires, leading to termination of the concession.  There has not been any media coverage, nor does Azurix management expect that the Governor will respond publicly.  However, there is always the risk that he will try to seize the initiative by terminating or otherwise attacking.  

Consequently, the attached statement and Q&As have been prepared for Enron use if needed.  Please let me know if you have any comments on the attached or need additional information.  FYI, Keith Miceli is taking the lead in Enron PR support for this effort.
