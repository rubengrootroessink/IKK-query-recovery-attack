The sale of Azurix North America to American Water Works will close tomorrow.  Azurix would like to issue the attached release after the close and receipt of payment tomorrow.  Your early review and comment would be greatly appreciated, as they also need to get the release to American Water Works once you have agreed to it.  I am at ext. 66423 if you have any questions.

John
