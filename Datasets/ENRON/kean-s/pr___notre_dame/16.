Please see attached the final drafts of the Enron Capital Trust I and Enron=
 Capital Trust II Forms 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing for the late fil=
ing of the 10-Qs for these two entities.  You may be more familiar with the=
se entities known as TOPrS I and TOPrS II (Trust Originated Preferred Secur=
ities).  Both of these securities are listed on the NYSE, and both file 10-=
Qs with the SEC.  Since the obligations for payments under these securities=
 are guaranteed by Enron,  the information in the Enron Corp. 10-Q (which w=
e are filing on Monday) is important to any TOPrS investors----so these two=
 10-Qs are being filed on the same schedule.  Ray:  I understand that you h=
ave succeeded to Ben Glisan's role as Regular Trustee (the person who signs=
 documents on behalf of the Trust---this is essentially an administrative f=
unction, since these trusts have no assets or operations or activities).  I=
 don't think anyone will pay much attention to these filings, but they must=
 be filed today.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you ha=
ve any questions.   Thanks, Rex
