Here are some recommended edits. I would think your customers would want to hear:

- Service will remain the same (or improve)
- Reaffirm financial stability 
- I am valued as a customer and my business is important (i.e. it is not taking the "back seat" to this merger process)
- Enron will continue to honor my contract(s)
- Where can I go for more details

Hope you find the remarks helpful. I did it as fast as possible. Feel free to call with questions.
