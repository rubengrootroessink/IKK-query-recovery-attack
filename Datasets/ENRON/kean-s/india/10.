Subject: Re: ENRON COMMENTS ON VI DRAFT

Attached are Enron's comments on Draft VI of the Electricity Bill 2000.  We 
note new and disturbing provisions in this draft that provide for 
interference of regulators in the business of Supply Companies and the 
unacceptable interference of the Central Government and State Legislatures in 
the freedom of transmission and supply enabling the diversion of supply to 
deficient regions.  Finally, there is a provision to cap supply prices in the 
event of extraordinary circumstances that is discussed.
