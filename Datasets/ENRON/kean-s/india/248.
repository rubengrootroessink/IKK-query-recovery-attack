As you know the Financial Times ran a story today on Ken Lay's comments about our wanting the government of India to buy us out of DPC.  We have had a flurry of media inquiries in India and a number in the US as well.  We see this as an opportunity to get across our key, related messages.  We intend to use the attached statement to respond.  Please let me know if you need any additional information on this issue.
