Steve,

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There 
are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by 
six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate 
contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 
40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by 
location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By 
company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three 
dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; 
DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to 
trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce 
the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best 
possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the 
event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of 
all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale 
evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon 
season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number 
of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by 
individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same 
resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in 
the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and 
offices there.
