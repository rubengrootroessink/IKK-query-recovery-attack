Just had a preview meeting with Wade Cline and Neil McGregor (Pres. of DPC).  
They are very supportive of the effort and felt that, while "Jane, you always 
bring us such good news!" that the depth of analysis and real time concerns 
articulated was an excellent thing for the company.  In fact, they wanted a 
few more mitigants put in and then shot down, anticipating Jeff Skilling-type 
questions.  Thus, this regulatory risk idea if done in depth for each 
region/project, may be a bigger service for Enron than you guys had ever 
anticipated.  They also thought of one more tack to take on the renegotiation 
issue to figure out how far we could go.  Good deal.  (However, will still 
wear body armor/butt plate into the Sanjay meeting next Wednesday).

They're working on the numbers, but it will be ugly.
