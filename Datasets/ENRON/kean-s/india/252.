The IFIs have filed a suit in India seeking to compel various parties to meet their obligations under the PPA, but more importantly to prevent DPC from terminating the PPA and proceeding with arbitration.  The initial legal review is that this will strengthen our case on a number of fronts even though it may result in short term inconvenience.  However, we need to be cautious in the way we present this.  We intend to respond to media inquiries on this issue with the attached statement.  Please let me know if you need additional information.
