Further to my note of last Friday, attached is the full report on negotiating the sale of DPC prepared by our consultant (with considerable input from Business Controls).  Highlights of the 17-page report include consideration of how Tata would finance a purchase (page 11) and what leverage can be applied on Tata and its chairman (pages 15-16).  Included separately are a publicly-available analysis of Tata Power and an interview with Tata Power Managing Director Adi Engineer.  As always, if you would like anything additional, please let me know.
