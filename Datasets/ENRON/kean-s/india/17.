Subject: MERC:Merit Order Dispatch


	

This memorandum is marked confidential because Mr. Subramanyam requested that 
this information be kept confidential.

In a meeting today after discussing an internal memorandum that was delivered 
to Mr. S. for his information, I was told that MERC does not plan to 
interfere in any way with the operation of merit order dispatch.  It will 
merely espouse economic dispatch in theory but defer to the operational 
expertise of MSEB.  Since MSEB avers in an Affidavit that it is already 
dispatching based on economic order, nothing will change due to interference 
by the regulator.  This ruling will obviously be in Dabhol's best interest.  
The recommendation has been dictated by MERC and, as he says, "We will not 
interfere with Dabhol."
