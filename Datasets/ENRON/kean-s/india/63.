Earlier today DPC notified the government of Maharashtra that they were 
initiating arbitration over the GoM's failure to live up to it's state 
support agreements.  There have not yet been any media inquiries, but expect 
the issue to be covered tomorrow.  Attached for your information is the 
statement we will use to respond.
