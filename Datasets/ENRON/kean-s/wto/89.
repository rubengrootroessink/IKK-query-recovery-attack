I guess because of the way the message was sent to me, I cannot include text 
in return, but responding to your question of what does Joe's last comment 
mean, presumably, it is that on these issues of WTO, I am not competent to 
advise you on them.  Leaving that aside, I further suspect that he sees me as 
the bette noir of the WTO ESC effort.  Finally, you might talk to Tom 
Briggs.  I think Joe has stood Tom's position on its head.  Joe has argued 
that we need to be in the ESC, because other things we care about like 
financial services regulation and e-commerce will be implicated.  He says Tom 
argues that we must liberalise energy to realise these objectives.  As I 
understand Tom (and he can speak for himself), if we do not get energy 
services liberalised (and the exclusion of third-party access is tantamount 
to not getting energy services liberalised) then the make-weight arguments 
about e-commerce and financial services fall away, at least as 
props/arguments for continuing the ESC.    talk to you later today   mcs

I had shared my note to you with Peter.  Thought you would find his reply 
comment of interest.  Peter and I are both very frustrated/disappointed (you 
probably knew that), but I think Joe knows it, too, which further explains 
his derogatory comment about us in London.  mcs

Raggett intervention likely attributable to Exxon again. I warned Joe and Bob 
Fisher about their insidious influence in April when I went to Washington. 
Also at that time Bob, Chris and I talked in detail about how to get TPA onto 
agenda through a coda or ancillary agreement to basic service provision/ 
investment categorisation, as happened for telecom in GATS. Who took their 
eye off the ball?

Tom Briggs was good enough to forward to me a piece of correspondence that 
Joe Hillings apparently shared with him.  My lack of enthusiasm for our WTO 
initiative, I know, has hardly been masked, but, frankly, what is contained 
in the incoming letter, below, I find quite disconcerting.  I have argued 
that in our key markets, e.g., Europe, Japan, etc. (I am assuming we do not 
need it in the USA, even today) the WTO initiative, i.e., liberalisation of 
energy siervices, would be of little value by the time it was implemented.  I 
had, apparently mistakenly, at least assumed that liberalisation of energy 
siervices at a minimum meant third-party access to transmission networks.  If 
not, then what the heck are we doing in this fight.  BUT, as you will see 
from the incoming, below, when Paul Hennemeyer, of my team here in London, 
joined Joe and Bob Fisher in Geneva to do a presentation on liberalisation of 
energy services in WTO, it provoked a letter, to which Joe responded, saying 
that the US Energy Services Coalition has NEVER taken a position on thrid 
party access, and it is doubtful they could agree to such a position (Joe 
agreed, and said this was just an Enron company position!).  You can probably 
guess my position on this, but I thought I would forward this to you for your 
information, and, if warranted, follow up, as the conversations we have had 
have never led me to believe that either of you thought we were pursuing a 
WTO initiative which did NOT involve third party access.   thanks  mcs

Mark and Paul:   It seems that Paul's enthustastic and brilliant presentation 
may have upset a few people.  Oh dear.  If we continue to push TPA as a 
prerequisite to energy services and trading, we might jeopardise the whole 
WTO process.  Thanks.

Brian: Thank you for your thoughtful and complete statement of the issue. The 
ESC has not taken any position on the regulatory details of market access nor 
advocated any such as Third Party Access although Enron certainly has taken a 
public position at the EU and other venues preferring TPA but willing to be 
practical about  the issue. I greatly appreciate your cutting through to the 
concern. It is helpful and hopefully will help us in future presentations; I 
know it will help me.

Regards,

Joe

Joe:

Having raised the matter covered by the exchange of e-mails between yourself
and Lyn, I feel I should clarify my observations of the meeting at the WTO.

I am confident that the WTO representatives were better informed and
enlightened by the presentations given by the ESC. I am sure they were also
struck, as was I, by Paul's enthusiastic explanation of the range of
innovative energy services offered by Enron. What sparked my concern was the
reference to access to energy networks.

Personally, I do not and, more importantly, nor does OGP take a position on
TPA in the EU, to which you refer in your communication. Even more so in the
context of the WTO, because it has never been discussed. I surmise though,
that other ESC members would have similar  reservations. My concerns were
heightened by questions on the subject raised by one or two of our
interlocutors. This part of the discussion then broadened somewhat and
included information about a court case in Germany to overcome entrenched
opposition to TPA by certain network operator(s). I know not whom.

I believe it would be a pity if the broader aspects of energy services,
supported generally by the ESC became subsumed by a debate on TPA , to
either nationally or privately owned networks, to which some WTO governments
outside Europe and the United States, maybe opposed.

While I detected concerns about this in the questions asked, I don't think
that the baby was thrown away with the bath-water. It is my view, however,
that the ESC should be cautious about raising an issue which some
governments  may perceive to be outside what they think is a more reasonable
agenda, and to which, rightly or wrongly, they have antipathy.  My concern
is that this may then  be used to forestall  the worthy and, perhaps, more
achievable objectives of  the ESC to include  the wide range of services
advocated, in the main, by Paul and by the others who presented.

I  most certainly have a positive view on the value of your work and I hope
this helps.

I am not sure at this point whether I will be available to join you in
London but I am planning to attend the  conference on November 27 and I look
forward to meeting you and Bob once again.

Kind regards,

Brian

 Lynn: Thank you for your response. Bob Fisher and I look forward to
meeting
 you, Brian Raggett and possibly others in London on Friday, December
1. We
 will be pleased to host lunch and would be grateful if you could
select the
 restaurant. Should another time be more convenient with you, please
let me
 know.

 From your response regarding the comment in Geneva, I am not feeling
that I
 addressed the specifics of your concern so at the risk of prolonging
the
 pain I'll make another stab at a response. If the concern centers on
 liberalization of transmission access for electricity and natural
gas, I
 would respond that we want to see the EU electricity and natural gas
 directives fully implemented. The EU had asked member countries to
fully
 implement transmission access and it is being accomplished in a
phased in
 approach. Some member countries are doing it in a way that makes
energy
 services possible, some to a less degree and so far, France has not
adopted
 the implementing legislation which is a subject of concern to the
EU.

 The opening up of markets to the maximum degree possible is a broad
goal of
 the Energy Services Coalition recognizing that this is a position
that has
 to be negotiated. We have not recommended any specific regulatory
system or
 regime.

 If I am still missing your concern, please bear with me and bring me
in
 closer to any concern that you may have.

 Regards and best wishes.

 Joe

 Joe,
      I am sorry that you were unable to telephone but I know the
reason.
 Our system has been down for upgrading. We had to expand our
bandwidth to
 accommodate the modern volume of email telephone line traffic.
Sorry.
      In response to your itinerary, I will be in town on Dec 1. I
will
 ask Brian Raggett to join us if he can and we can see if there is
any one
 else. The issue that arose at the last meeting in Geneva seems to
center
 around the special problems  of inclusion of pipelines and
electrical lines
 as part of energy services.
      Brian Raggett was at the Geneva meeting and has a first hand
 interpretation of the meeting.

           Lyn

 Lynn: I have been unable to get through on your telephone line this
morning
 so will attempt to fax this and accompanying message to you as
recommended
 by Brian Petty.

 If it is not fully responsive to the questions raised regarding our
 presentation to the WTO in Geneva, please feel free to contact me.
Neither
 the ESC nor Enron advocates any abregation of contract. Further, the
ESC
 has not specifically advocated any regulatory system and has no
plans to do
 so. We do advocate and advance as much market access as we can get
for
 companies providing energy services.

 Bob Fisher (Hills and Company) and I plan to be in Brussels for the
 European Services Federation conference on Monday, November 27th and
I have
 been invited to partipate on a panel which I have accepted.  Bob and
I are
 then planning to travel to Germany, Oslo and London to meet with any
energy
 industry people interested in meeting with us to discuss the energy
 services effort.

 Monday, Nov. 27 Brussels Conference (We hope Brian Raggett can
participate)
 Tuesday, Nov. 28 calls on EC
 Wednesday, Nov. 29 meeting in Dusseldorf/Essen with industry people
 (planning stage)
 Thursday, Nov. 30 meetings in Oslo with industry people (planning
stage)
 Friday, December 1 meetings in London (Can we have lunch with you
and do
 you want us to meet with others)?
 Satuday, December 2 depart for Washington

 Please let us know if Friday will work for you and how you advise we
should
 proceed. We would also like to meet with British Electric Assn and
possibly
 someone in DTI.

 Joe
