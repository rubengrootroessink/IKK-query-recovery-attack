Steve:

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you.  Hope this is what you had in 
mind.

My thinking on this was to give the Commissioners a tour of the world, with 
examples drawn from the pieces sent in by your team members.  The other two 
panelists are the president of NEMA, and Donna Bobbish, an attorney.  So we 
would definitely have more of substance to say on international market access 
and regulatory issues in the countries in which we operate.  

The theme is as you suggested: success is measured in market penetration by 
new entrants, not in announced reforms or new treaties and pronouncements.

We could then submit separately the full presentations from the regional team 
leaders.  But since you have 10-15 minutes to testify, you might consider 
this 30,000 foot level presentation, then follow up with specifics in the Q&A 
session.

Please look it over and we can discuss.  You can call me tomorrow at 
202-466-9166.  Otherwise I'll meet you for dinner tomorrow night at your 
hotel, and I can make substantive changes then, in time for the 9:30 
presentation on Tuesday morning.

Regards,
Steve Burns
