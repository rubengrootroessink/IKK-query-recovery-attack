Subject: URE Statement on Criteria for Lifting Tariff Approval Requirements

The President of the Regulatory Authority has recently issued a 3-page=20
statement, outlining the criteria he will take into account in assessing=20
whether to release companies (ie, generators and trading companies) from th=
e=20
tariff approval requirements in the Polish Energy Law.  We may arrive at a=
=20
situation later this year where we have signed the necessary transmission,=
=20
balancing and settlement contract(s) with PSE so that we can do wholesale=
=20
trades -but are still subject to the requirement to get our trades (sales,=
=20
not purchases) "approved" by URE before we can conclude them. =20

The URE statement and recent press comments by the regulator do not give us=
=20
any grounds to believe that traders such as Enron are going to be released=
=20
soon from this requirement (in the press he has talked about possibly=20
releasing some generators from the requirement in early 2001).  We may=20
therefore need to investigate getting an "approved tariff".  However, unles=
s=20
we can get a framework agreement in place (so we don't need to get each and=
=20
every transaction separately approved), this does not appear to be a workab=
le=20
solution.

The attached statement is unhelpful in that it appears to be simply a list =
of=20
every conceivable reason that URE could want to use at some point to justif=
y=20
continuing with the current restrictions.  While some (but far from all) of=
=20
the issues raised are genuine concerns, it does not of course follow that=
=20
requiring tariffs to be approved for all generators and traders is the righ=
t=20
response.  (In October 1999 we presented to URE the reasons why we believe=
=20
that these requirements make no sense for a new entrant supplier such as=20
Enron.) =20

However, since this issue is unlikely to go away, Jarek D. and I plan to us=
e=20
this statement to develop a dialogue with URE and see if we can find a=20
workable way forward.

Regards,
Philip



URE definition of  "competitive market" which must exist before he can=20
consider lifiting the requirements:

"The Authority=01,s President defines the competitive market as a market wh=
ere=20
the transaction price is determined as a result of free interplay between=
=20
supply and demand, and the customer has the right to choose the supplier=20
without restraint, and to change it without excessive costs to himself, as=
=20
well as being able to decide the quantity of purchases. Each of the subject=
s=20
on the competitive market functions within similar external conditions. The=
=20
transactions concluded on this market are subject to civil and legal=20
regulations, or customary ones, and the information regarding the prices of=
=20
goods on offer are generally accessible. The President of the URE estimates=
=20
that as far as electric power is concerned, a supplier=01,s market rather t=
han a=20
competitive market is still in operation, because the customers are not abl=
e=20
to exert economic pressure where their preferences are taken into account."
