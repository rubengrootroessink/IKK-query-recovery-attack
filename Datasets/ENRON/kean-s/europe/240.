Mark, 
Steven,

please find enclosed some information about our German Gas Origination activities. Next to all the regulatory and market structure challenges we talked about, we have been very successful to get the first deals, earn some money and being a pain for the German incumbents (see attached power point slides).

As requested I also attached the faxes (EnronGasMarketFax and EnronEnergyFax) we send out on a biweekly basis to more than 700 market counterparts to create price transparency. Enron was the first and still is the only one who offers these data to the whole German market.

Again thank you for your time last week in Houston, it was very useful to get your insights for our further development.  

Andreas
