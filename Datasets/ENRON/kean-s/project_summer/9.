This is for you. Sorry I sent to another Karen.  Fortunately she is in my 
group and I was able to go the machine since she was not at work and 
eliminate it from the mail and trash shortly thereafter.  


Attached is a draft proposal for the Chairman, pls. review and share 
comments! Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.
