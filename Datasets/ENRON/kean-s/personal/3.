Steve,

Sorry to cut you off, Dr. Boxleiter called me back.  He was unaware that Dad
might be released soon and also said that he thought that it would be
premature to do so.  He promised to look into Dad's release and let us know
what is going on.  Boxleiter also told me that Dad is on some different
medication: Ridilin (sic), an appetite stimulant, Rimeron, and possibly
Buspar (still).  Mom was unaware of the Ridilin.

Here are the Doctor's telephone numbers:

Boxleiter 584-3500
Herman  557-9111
Schoup  557-9111

Let me know if you and when you reach them so that we don't both badger
them.  I will do the same.  My plan is to call every day until I reach them.
Failing that, I will be in MPLS this week and able to fly down on a moment's
notice.

Take care,

Rob

P.S.  Dad was moved to room 422 which is "Skilled Care" - a Medicare thing.
