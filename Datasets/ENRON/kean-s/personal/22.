I found these sites useful.

Search engine:

www.ixquick.com  I've gotten great results doing searches using common
lauguage searches (as opposed to Boolean searches).  It is a "metasearch
engine" which gathers info from 10 or more web sites.

www.moreover.com  This is a news website which collects info from 1800
websites when you do a common language search.  It includes international
sites as well.  Here is a link to a search when you type in Enron:
http://www.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?o=portal&h=Search+results+for...+Enro
n&query=Enron.  I think it's a great site.
