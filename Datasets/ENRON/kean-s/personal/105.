Steve,

I promised myself that I would not leave today until I have sent this e-mail.
I want you to know how much I admired your professional, humane, and
responsible leadership of the public affairs group. You did make me feel
"comfortable" working here. I am especially proud of your management 
of this crises and the compassion that you have shown. I will continue 
to pray for Enron, that such a truly great company will be restored to 
greatness again. I also will pray for you all in the management team 
for wisdom and strength at this difficult time.

May God richly bless you,
Gloria
