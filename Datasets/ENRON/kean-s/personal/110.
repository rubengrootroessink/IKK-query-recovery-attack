I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed working with you.  I 
loved the Company and what it stood for.  I think it stood for the 
right things and in the end those right things will win the day -- 
even in California -- it just may take a long time.  I had a great 
time working for Enron, and the Government Affairs organization, 
built by you and Rick, was truly awesome.  It was an honor to work 
with you.

But on a personal note, I was shocked and disappointed to be one of 
those chosen to be terminated Monday. Further, I think what the 
Company is doing to all its laid-off employees is beyond despicable. 
It was a total slap in the face to be terminated with no severance -- 
the $4500 is a slap in the face -- basically a week's pay for me. I 
wish those in charge paid as much attention to "enron's values" as 
its employees did.

I'm getting beyond my anger now.  I plan to be an independent 
consultant -- that way I can never be fired again!  I'll let you know 
how it goes.

Take care.

Sue
