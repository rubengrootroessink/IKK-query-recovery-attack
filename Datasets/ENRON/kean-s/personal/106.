Hello to all,
 
I want to thank each of you for the wonderful experience and the opportunity to work with you.  I had a great time at Enron, and was blessed to have been involved in such a great company.  More than the company, was the opportunity to meet and work with truly intelligent and down to earth people.  You guys are great, and I hope that someday we will cross paths again.  Take care, and if you ever need any help outside of work, let me know.
 
Regards,
 
Matthew Campbell
