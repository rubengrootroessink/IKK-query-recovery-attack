Steve,

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 

I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.

Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.

Terrie
