Steve,

Thanks for your time the other day.  I hope you got some rest on Labor Day Weekend.  You sounded pretty tired.  
Its not that I want to pound on the same ideas but as agreed I am attaching a document that I hope will contain some useful ideas or examples of what some other fellows and I think is going on at Enron.  I hope you do not find it too long.  I used a BIG font.

This document does not pretend to be exhaustive.  I basically tried to put some ideas in order.  I don't know if I was successful.  On some matters I am sure you will have a different a more informed point of view. I hope this is useful.

Best,

Ricardo
