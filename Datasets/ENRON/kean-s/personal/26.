I'll get started on Phil's pc and ship Kathy's next week.  You owe $50 or
whatever you want to contribute.

Thanks Rob

It's alittle early to be talking about Phil's birhtday but I have had some
conversations with him about replacing his PC with a more modern one that I
will build for him.  I want to know if you want to go in with me. He'll get
the PC in the near future but I don't expect anyone to contribute until his
birthday.

Here's the way it would work: we give Phil a new PC, I send an old Compaq
of
ours to Kathy and Alan Wedig, Phil sends his old PC to some friends of mine
who live in Duluth, MN.  That means that our entire family will be
connected.

If not, I would send the Old Compaq to Phil otherwise and then he could
send
his old one to Kathy and Alan.  The only problem with this scenario is that
Phil's old PC is getting a little too old.  Our friends in Duluth wouldn't
mind getting an old PC because they've never owned one.  I thought that
Phil
would benefit the most from getting a brand new PC.  The old Compaq is will
still be okay for a while and Kathy should be fine with it.

What do you guys think?  If i do this right, Kathy would have a PC for her
birhtday in March.
