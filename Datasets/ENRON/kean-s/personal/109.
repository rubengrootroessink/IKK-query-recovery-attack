Steve- In our various telephonic and email dealings regarding my representation of Enron with the California Senate hearings I never got to meet you personally and never realized you were a Hawkeye until recently seeing the Enron executive bios. I grew up there and went to both undergraduate and law school at Iowa. Hope things are going as well as can be expected under these dire circumstances for Enron. Have a good holiday. I truly enjoyed representing Enron over the past year. Best regards
