Its a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ? Why is this so ?

Colin,

Can you get me the XML schemas or DTDs for EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.SITARA and EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.TAGG?

I need to figure out the mappings for conterparty id, price, volume, etc.

Attached are the msgs captured on the TIB.
 << File: TAGG.txt >>  << File: SITARA.txt >> 

Thanks,

Ronggen Pan
