What instant messaging are you using?  I am disappointed that Deirdre has left.  Liz is in the VAR group and needs to be here early.

How come Instant Messaging only works for you?  I can not find most people on the trading floor (ie., Fletch, Arnold, etc)  It is kinda of ridiculous.  
By the way, I will be on the fifth and sixth floor of the new building.  Since the Wellhead desk/ Ecommerce will be on six and the rest of Upstream Products will be on five, I will be up and down on the escalators all day.

I heard that Deirdre went to the freight group under Reck.  How do you feel about that?  Probably don't give a damn since she did not report directly to you.  However, I think it is unfortunate that she left ENA.  

I saw Elizabeth Shim today.  She told me that she gets to work by 5:00 am.  Is it really necessary?  How powerful, forcing analysts to work from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm when most of the traders leave at 4:30 pm.  HMMM,
