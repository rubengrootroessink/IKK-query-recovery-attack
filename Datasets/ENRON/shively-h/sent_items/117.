Cora,

Thanks for the update.  I concur with the volumes base on the contract.  

Virawan - I have hedged 4,500,000 mmbtu's.  If you decide to inject more or less than that, you will be exposed fixed price against Jan, Feb, and Mar-02.  You have a copy of the contract, however, let's go over it sometime this week.

Attached please find the storage numbers as of October 22, 2001.  The total amount we must have in storage is 4,500,000 mmbtu and if we keep going for the remainder of the month we will have a volume of 4,507,779 mmbtu which will make us over by 7,779.  We are leaving this number out there until the last day of the month in the event that we encounter any cuts between now and then.   Per the contract we must have a minimum volume of 4,250,000 but no more than 4,500,000 by October 31, 2001.  If we have at least 4,250,000 but less than 4,500,000 then Michcon will allow us to extend the injection period until November 30, 2001  However,  if we have to go into November and inject gas they will give us a fixed amount to put in every day and there will be NO variation on that amount.   Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

Cora
