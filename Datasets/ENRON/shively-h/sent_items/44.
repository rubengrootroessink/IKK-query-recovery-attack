I know her husband.  I prefer to fill any future openings with trading track personnel.  However I would talk to her.

Dan McCarty stopped me today and said that he is looking at bringing down an employee from Omaha who has a wife at Tenaska - Lori Neubauer - who would need a job.  Ever heard of her - any interest in talking to her?
