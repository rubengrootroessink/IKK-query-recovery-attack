Interviewers:

Since Shawn Abboud was "on the bubble" after round 1 (interviewers: Grant Zimmerman and Vivek Kumar) and
Bradley Johl was not found to be strong after his round 1 telephone interview (interviewers: James Scribner and John Walt)  my recommendation to the group is to remove them from the list.  Ramsey Soliman was found to be stronger after round 1, so I think we should keep her.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

All -

Thanks again for all your help yesterday!

From our final meeting yesterday we identified 19 candidates to bring back to Super Saturday.  I can bring back no more than 17.

Based on yesterday's discussion the following candidates are "on the bubble:"

Bradley Johl
Ramsey Soliman
Shawn Abboud

We need to come to a consensus on which 2 to remove from our list.  Hopefully, we can decide this via e-mail discussions rather than calling everyone into a group meeting.

Please share your comments with the group.

Thank you!
