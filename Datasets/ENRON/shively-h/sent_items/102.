It appears that Enron fundementals would disagree with a alot of these assertions, but it is interesting to see what CERA is expected to publish Mid-June.

Subject:  RE: Meeting with CERA

Enclosed are my notes from the discussion we had with CERA this morning. The
most important item is that CERA is revising their short-term forecast
significantly downward (from high $4.00s to high to mid $3.00s this summer).
This new forecast will be officially published next week. Please see  the
attachment for more information.
