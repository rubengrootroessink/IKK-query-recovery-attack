Energy InfoDisc Release

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has released
its latest quarterly CD-ROM, Energy InfoDisc, which is now
a two (2) disc product. Energy InfoDisc is a comprehensive,
high-tech product that is easy to use, yet robust enough
for serious number crunching and analysis.  It provides
fast, easy, and inexpensive access to:

- Historical time series for production, consumption,
prices, and resource availability of conventional and
alternate energy resources

- Analyses of economic and technical topics

- Projections of future energy supply, demand, and prices
database applications that allow users to generate their
own individualized energy databases

On disc 1, users may view and search more than 400 data,
analysis, and forecasting reports and directories
published by EIA over the previous 12 months, including
the Monthly Energy Review, Short-Term Energy Outlook,
International Energy Outlook, and Country Analysis Briefs.
On disc 2, users may access EIA's extensive energy
database applications to generate their own individualized
energy databases.  Among the EIA database applications
contained on the Energy InfoDisc:

Annual Energy Outlook 2000
Electricity Databases
Oil and Gas Information System
Short-Term Energy Model
State Energy Data
U.S. Emissions of Greenhouse Gases
World Energy Database

Each new quarterly issue highlights new products and any
changes or enhancements to the CD. Energy InfoDisc contains
information on special industry topics such as the
restructuring of the electric power industry and greenhouse
gases and global warming.  Publications are displayed in
Portable Document Format (PDF). Most of the energy database
applications are written in Microsoft Access. The Microsoft
Access run-time engines required for these applications are
included.

Energy InfoDisc is issued quarterly. STAT-USA, a U.S.
Department of Commerce information service for business,
economic, and trade professionals, distributes EnergyInfoDisc,
through a cooperative agreement with EIA.  Orders can be
placed over STAT-USA's toll free order number: 1-800-STAT-USA
or by calling (202) 482-1986.  Energy InfoDisc can also be
purchased through the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS). NTIS is the federal government's central source for
the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related
business information produced by or for the U.S. government
and complementary material from international sources.  To
place an order by phone, call 1-800-553-NTIS (6847) or
