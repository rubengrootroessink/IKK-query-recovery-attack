Stephanie,


 We would like to set up the central books as their own Master books to 
prevent all deals being booked to Hunter's Intra-Central book.
 Could you please set up the traders with their own physical and financial 
book names in EOL?
  - attatched is a lists of the book names.


 Thanks,


  Kam
