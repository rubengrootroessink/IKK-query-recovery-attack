FYI.   We need to get back to Doug as soon as possible.  This should be a 
good 
opportunity to meet his new boss.

As we discussed, my new boss, TJ Aruffo is interested in a tour of Enron's
Houston Trade Floor.  He is available the morning of the 1st.  He is flying
out of Intercontinental at 2:45 PM.  As far as I know he will be travelling
alone.  He  has not requested my presence yet.

The purpose of his visit is to see first-hand a world-class energy trade
floor and to begin networking with key industry personnel.  He is new to
this side of the business.  His previous role was NiSource CIO; so he comes
into his new position with a systems and process oriented view.   His
responsibilities at NiSource encompass the regulated gas supply management
and gas control operations of eight of NiSource's gas utilities (two are
primarily managed by EnergyUSA-TPC - NIFL and Kokomo).  He is responsible
for Bay State (and Northern Utilities), NIPSCO, and the Columbia
Distribution Companies (five LDC's).  We are currently fragmented in
Massachusetts, Columbus and Indiana and are in the process of evaluating how
to bring this together, functionally, locationally, or not at all.  TJ
reports to Pat Mulchay, who is President of the Merchant Energy Division.
Pat reports directly to Gary Neale, our CEO.

TJ's previous background includes a stint at Fidelity Investments, so a
trade floor is not new to him.

Please confirm Enron's address and if you don't mind, recommend a hotel that
is convenient.  Let me know who will be meeting TJ then we can  turn the
details of finalizing the arrangements over to TJ and your designee.  Thanks
for your help.
