Hunter - per our conversation the other day, I am finishing up my first 
rotation with the LNG group and am very interested in rotating into your 
Fundamentals group.  I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to 
further discuss such opportunities.  Please let me know what time is good for 
you.

Regards,

Dustin
