Subject: ENA Analyst and Associate "Brownbag" Presentations


It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

Dave
