Hunter-

Thanks for letting me show you the Gas Model. I want you to know I will 
always go out of my way to help you and your traders develop and use good 
models.

I need tools, and Kevin has been fantastic supporting with these. He's alread 
bought a $25,000 Sun server to be dedicated to real-time mathematical models.

Can  I can tentatively count you "in" on the SAS software. Our current 
license expires Sep. 14 (ie, soon), and I need to knowing where a total of 
$40,000 is coming from. As it turns out, I "need" to count on Gas for around 
$15,000, which I note is a lower price to you for unlimited user access than 
you would pay for a single-workstation SAS PC license. Remember, not only are 
many of the calculations you need  too big for Excel, my own Gas Model will 
run in SAS and will be available to you. And, Carmen Ayala in Contract 
Administration, will support you every step of the way here, since her 
assignment is to wean Enron from an obscenely expensive emerging addiction to 
SAS-PC

I'm sorry to have to bug you like this, but I have a deadline staring me in 
the face.

Clayton
