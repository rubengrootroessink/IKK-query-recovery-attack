Steve--Thanks.  This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.  
Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be 
able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea 
that some "penalty" or separate charge should be attributed to those that 
cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of 
is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.)

Christi,
 I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.  
The conclusion is that price caps are infact creating part of the problem.

The attached paper (which was presented to the OPUC by its author last
month) provides a nice summary of some of the reasons behind the turmoil
in California.
