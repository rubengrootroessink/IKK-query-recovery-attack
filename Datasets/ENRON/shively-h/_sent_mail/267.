Subject: MKM Demo

I  spoke with some of you concerning the Market Knowledge Management (MKM) 
project.  At this time, we would like to demonstrate the MKM pilot  to you.

To refresh your minds, MKM is a one-stop shopping for market data and 
associated activities.  The project is done in collaboration between two 
groups in Houston and one in London.  In November/December 1999 some of you 
took part in user forums to discuss the feasibility of a one-stop shop for 
market data

Background:
The intention is that all existing systems (i.e. various databases and 
services) will be linked through a common infrastructure that will allow all 
these systems to provide the services they have always provided plus a set of 
standard services, such as:
Security
Data Validation
Notification
Auditing, and 
Calculation.

In addition, it will allow client applications to ask MKM for the data and 
services they need instead of going to individual systems.  The point here is 
that the user (or application) 
will not need to know where the data resides, and
will have a uniform level of services across all systems

Demonstration:
A pilot was developed to prove the underlying technology and to provide users 
a simple demonstration of the product to derive exact user requirements.

The demo will include the following components:

Browser: provides a user interface for publishing and retrieving a limited 
selection of price and volume data for gas and power busines units;
Time Series Index: stores time series metadata;
Message Station: an inbox which holds inbound time series data;
TIBCO messaging backbone: underpins MKM and is transparent to the user;
and Connectivity to two market data servers:- LIM (Houston) and PR1P(London).

The remaining components will be delivered in following phases.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to demo of the product.  
I would like to schedule the demonstration for Friday, June 23 at 1:00.  
Could you also RSVP me.  I am also attaching a document which will give you 
more information of the MKM project.    If you cannot meet me on the 
suggested date, I can you a demo of MKM at your desk at your convenience.  If 
you would like to go through the browser, the web address is 
http://test-mkmtimeseriesindex.enron.co.uk/default.asp?canregister=true.  Use 
your network id and password to gain access to the web site.  If you have any 
questions please call me at 35733.


Thank you in advance,
Thomas
