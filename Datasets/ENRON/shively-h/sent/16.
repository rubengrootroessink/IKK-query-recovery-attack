Andy - can you please forward this email to your book person to change these 
attached deals from ENA- PGL  to ENA - and the actual counterparty.  Our 
confirmation guys should send out a confirm to verify these deals.

Tony is continuing to look for additional Harper \ northern border supplies.  
I will let you know if he finds anything of interest.
