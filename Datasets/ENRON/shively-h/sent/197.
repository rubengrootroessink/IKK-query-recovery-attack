The control automatically sets the volume to the optimal level when you use
the mic to eliminate unwanted noise and static. I had Patrice go to our
corporate demo site and speak for a few minutes. We did not hear her volume
go down. I was logged in on my PC and I also dialed in with my cell phone to
see if I could notice anything abnormal. But, she sounded fine. The other
thing is that, according to Patrice, she is the only one having this problem
with her volume going down which is why I am gravitating towards a localized
problem.

Brent: I will be back in the office tomorrow morning. Can you spare some
time?

Thanks.
Darshan.
