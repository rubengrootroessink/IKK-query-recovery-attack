Chris/Hunter,

	I just wanted to make you aware of EGM's intent to possibly separate their website from the fundamentals structure.  The impact of this would be that EGM content would no longer be available within the Commodity Fundamentals website.  I personally do not feel that this is the best decision for the business ENA&EGM, it would limit the current vehicle in which content is delivered.  I also believe that considering the current state of Enron this is not the time to duplicate cost & effort because of ownership concerns.  I've voiced these concerns to Randal Frisbie and just wanted to make you aware of the possible loss of content.

Thanks,

David Dronet

David,

We are planning to separate the database and COM+ components that are shared by both groups. We would like the flexabiliy to make changes to the database structure and COM+ component functionality to improve the overall capability of the EGM Fundamentals web site without having to go through any approval process of the Gas Fundamentals group. 

We are currently looking at the pros and cons of this sepatation and will keep you informed as we move forward.

We would like the source code for both COM+ components that are used by both groups so that we can leveral off of existing code.

Thanks,

Randal
