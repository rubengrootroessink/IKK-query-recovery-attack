  In the discussion to choose my reviewers for the PEP this year I was told to include individuals on the business side.  I chose you and Chris Gaskill as the primary business reviewers because of my work on Jaguar and the Weather Server (as well as general support of the floor) during the first four months of this year.  If you have any reservations or concerns or are just not interested in doing my review in addition to all the necessary reviews I understand completely, please just let me know.  If you have any questions for me please call me or email me.

Thanks
Marc Bir
