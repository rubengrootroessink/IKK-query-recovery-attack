FYI, looks as if they are eager to completed this before Friday.   Chris, I can't say much 
as far as the applications go, but we should be concerned about the content
on the websites that your Fundamentals teams developed.  We can talk more in the morning.

It turns out we need to build out a copy of the Gas Fundamentals for both Estate and NetCo.  The Estate instance must run on Estate Servers instead of being co-hosted on NetCo clusters.  I have attached an report image of the servers that were previously listed in the Assets Database as a starting point. 

By tomorrow morning's meeting we need to the have the following questions answered: 

Are there servers available for the separation ? 
How long will it take to configure both Estate and Netco Instances ? 
When will each environment be available for testing ? 
When can we have test plans completed ?

Sorry for the last minute notice.  This is a "HOT" item that we need to have resolved ASAP.
