NEW FEATURES
from The Wall Street Journal


Dear Subscriber:

If your New Year's resolution is to advance your career and boost the size
of your paycheck, then look no further than CareerJournal, The Wall Street
Journal's career site for executives, managers and professionals. We've
added extensive compensation data, plus several other convenient features,
as we continue in our quest to make CareerJournal the Web's most useful
and focused site for professionals like you.

Our new features include:

--Improved Salary Data--
We've added a huge free database of compensation tables for thousands of
job titles throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 200 countries around
the globe. To access this new data, simply click on the Salary & Hiring
link below, then click on your industry or function in the menu. The data
are being provided by the Economic Research Institute (ERI), a top
compensation and benefits research firm, and complements the hundreds of
salary tables we've always featured on the site, as well as the in-depth
articles we publish each week on hiring demand by function and industry.

--Special Reports: Diversity and Academia--
Minority candidates, as well as those seeking careers in academia, face
special challenges in the job market. In our reports, we offer specific
guidance on unique recruitment issues. Our Diversity special report
focuses on such issues as why hiring of minority candidates has stayed
strong during the recession, and why a company's track record in promoting
diverse employees is critical when attracting new hires.

Our report on academic career issues includes articles on why corporate
executives without academic experience are in demand among many learning
institutions, and on the expanding role of professional fund-raisers among
eductaional employers.

--Executive Education Center--
If you're considering an executive education program, our new center
offers background information on hundreds of business programs offered
globally. Program descriptions include quick summaries, in-depth outlines,
locations, times, prices and registration information. The center only
features business schools that have been ranked or recognized by major
publications and/or professional organizations.
