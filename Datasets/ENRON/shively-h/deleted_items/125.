TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
JANUARY 2002
____________________________________________
Dear UT Friend:
Winter may be just a few weeks old officially, but spring has arrived on campus. Or at least the spring semester, which gets under way this week. With best wishes for a prosperous new year, we bring you this eclectic trio of items as the first TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE of 2002:
WHEN GOLFING GREATS BEN CRENSHAW AND JUSTIN LEONARD helped the United States win the Ryder Cup in 1999, the prize included $100,000 for each team member to donate to the college of their choice. Naturally, both Longhorns chose their alma mater, and the UT Golf for Life program was born. UT students are seeing the benefits of this collaboration with PGA of America -- one of 14 university partnerships nationwide -- including increased access to driving ranges and putting greens and personalized coaching from PGA-affiliated guest instructors. Hmmm... burnt orange plaid pants, anyone?--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/golf.html
THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY saw celebrated Texas photographer George O. Jackson traversing Mexico to capture a visual record of more than 200 community festivals. The result is the Essence of Mexico Project, including 50,000 color images and Jackson's own copious notes on the important festivals of more than 60 indigenous Mexican cultures. This exhaustive undertaking has spawned five museum exhibitions in nine international venues. Now, thanks to Jackson's generous donation, it resides permanently in the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, which is part of UT's General Libraries. The project will be archived during the next two years with Jackson's assistance.--> SEE http://www.lib.utexas.edu/about/news/jackson.html
IF YOU ARE A FAN of the University's StarDate radio program -- which is heard on 250 stations nationwide -- youmay want to check out StarDate Online, a universe of information on all things astronomical. While there, you can support science education in Texas with your purchase of the 2002 edition of the StarDate Sky Almanac. Brought to you by the folks who produce the award-winning StarDate magazine, the $4 guide contains a year's worth of skywatching information -- how to find planets, stars, and constellations, and when to watch for meteor showers -- as well as what's coming up this year in space exploration. All proceeds benefit the public education programs of UT's McDonald Observatory.--> SEE http://stardate.org
