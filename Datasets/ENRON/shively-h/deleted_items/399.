I apologies for the vagueness of my email, however as you know we have attempted to build various implementations/prototypes/plasma applications involving EOL data. The basis of most of our real-time work is around the messages distributed by EOL over tibco, i.e. product bid/offer/volume information.

In addition, I was approached by the EOL team because there were concerns that certain traders were hitting the EOL database too frequently (Dutch Q. - P/L report). The only way to resolve this would be use the real-time EOL deal transaction information.

Thus I corresponded on many occasions with various people in the EOL group, requesting information to help us gain a further understanding of the EOL system in order to facilitate the above. In addition, I requested a meeting with certain EOL team member ... this was declined (response was that they did not have enough information).

Out of frustration, I contacted David Forster. He asked me to forward all questions to him directly, and he would pass them to Michael Guadarrama, with a note to me saying that if my question was not answered by the following day, let me know ... etc ...

I really don't have the time to go through this painful process of having to forward my questions to a VP !!! So, I tried to contact Michael directly, the following transcript is the consequence.

Not to sound like a broken record Hunter but EOL data analysis is becoming more and more important to Gas Fundamentals, and without support from the EOL group, it can only make our life more difficult.

Colin,

Can you get me the XML schemas or DTDs for EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.SITARA and EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.TAGG?

I need to figure out the mappings for conterparty id, price, volume, etc.

Attached are the msgs captured on the TIB.
 << File: TAGG.txt >>  << File: SITARA.txt >> 

Thanks,

Ronggen Pan
