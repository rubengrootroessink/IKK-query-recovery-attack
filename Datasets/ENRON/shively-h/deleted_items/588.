 HSX : This Week May 31, 2001       In the interest of keeping things fresh=
 and new here at HSX, we've decided to try a little experiment called Trade=
r Talk. Each week, a new question will be posted to Ticker Talk about the M=
ovie Market, the Music Market, hot actors and actresses, or whatever the ma=
in controversies of the day are. Hopefully, these issues will spark a few i=
nteresting responses which will be used that week in a feature article. Wha=
t do ya think?        Alrighty, now that we have the basic ideas down, here=
 are the ground rules: *I'm looking for about three or four different posts=
, each about a paragraph long *Be nice (not to us, but to the other traders=
) *Naughty language is a no-no *The name you use on your post will be the n=
ame used in the article        For the first topic, I'd love it if you coul=
d send be any quick tips for the budding, young trader. Quick ways to make =
a buck, what to look out for, and basic dos and don'ts of the Exchange. (If=
 you hate this topic, not a problem. I'm always up for suggestions.)       =
 If you have any questions, comments, complaints, or deep thoughts on the s=
ubject, drop me a line.   Adios, Erin Margolis, Editor Hollywood Stock Exch=
