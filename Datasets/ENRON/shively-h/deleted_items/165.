Fantasy Football does not end with the NFL regular season
anymore. Now SuperBowl.com extends the fun into the playoffs!
Field your own Fantasy team in the SuperBowl.com Playoff
Challenge and compete for great prizes, including trips to
next year's Super Bowl and Pro Bowl.

It's free to play - and easy too. Before the NFL's Wild Card
games (Jan. 12-13), you'll pick eight players from the 12 NFL
playoff teams. You can make changes to your lineup after each
playoff round. The top overall scorer goes to next year's
Super Bowl in San Diego.

The Playoff Challenge officially kicks off with the start of
the NFL playoffs, but you can sign up now to review statistics
and scouting reports. So get a headstart on scouting the
players you think will score the most fantasy points this
postseason. Sign up today!
