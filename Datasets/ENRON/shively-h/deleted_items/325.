  AvantGo Travel Survey
***********************
Hello huntshiv,
We were hoping that you could take a few minutes to fill out 
a short travel survey for us. This is your chance to help 
shape the future of AvantGo!
Understanding the travel practices of our users helps us make 
sure that we create the best business partnerships that bring 
the most useful content and applications to you and our other 
users.
Completing the survey should take less than 10 minutes. There 
are only 20 questions--you already know the answers.
        
Click here to fill out the survey:http://kc-tr.avantgo.com/kc1231906901.1056.0.948 And, don't worry, the information you supply is confidential 
and will be used only for research purposes. Information will 
not be attributed to individual respondents, and your 
information will NOT be given or sold to other parties. 
If you have any questions, please read our Privacy Statement 
for additional information: http://kc-tr.avantgo.com/kc1231906901.1056.0.275 Thanks for your help,
