Dear Subscriber:

The Wall Street Journal Online enters an exciting chapter in its
nearly six-year history today, with the introduction of the new,
greatly enhanced Online Journal. The site now gives you more control
of the news that matters most to you. It also provides new and more
effective ways for you to take advantage of the wealth of exclusive
news and information that has made us the Web's most successful
subscription news site.

I believe you'll find the time we spent interviewing subscribers
like you to ensure our new site was good enough to live up to the
reputation of the world's most trusted newspaper was well worth the
effort. The end result is a state of the art site with new features
from us and powerful benefits for you.  It's also incredibly easy to
use, offering new personalization features, tools and much more.

Your suggestions, your feedback, your high expectations have always
fueled our work. But the new Online Journal truly represents the
collective desires of our subscribers. I hope you'll take a few
minutes to create your own personalized home page and cruise through
our tour to see just how much power and functionality you now have
at your fingertips.

As always, I hope you let us know what you think of our efforts to
make the Online Journal your most up-to-date, most reliable and now
most effective source for global business news and information.
