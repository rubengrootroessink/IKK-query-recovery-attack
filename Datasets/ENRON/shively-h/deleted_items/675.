Hey Kirk, 
Hunter has a good point.  It would be good to have a daily report of the volumes that we could potentially lose - ie ANR SE Transmission and Gathered volumes plus Trunkline.   Kevin- this could be something that we include on fundys website (a download from Unify maybe?) - both the central and east desks could benefit.

excellent.  We need daily reports that represents the volume that we could loose.  The schedulers must know the proper rankings and cut procedures in a hurricane forms.

Hunter,
FYI - Next Tuesday we will be getting together with Tom to talk about what we will need to be prepared for in a hurricane.  We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.  This will be more efficient and accurate.  The code freeze on Unify will soon be lifted since the migration to the new server will happen this weekend.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions. 

Lisa
