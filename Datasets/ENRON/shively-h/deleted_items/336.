Guys,

Please review the attached transaction that Sylvia brought to successful closure.  Any transaction that is closed and can be deemed a product that we need to be pitching to a wide customer group will be shared in this forum to each of you.

Please forward the information to me and upon review, I will forward to the group.  Each transaction summary should include the following:  counterparty, structure, term, value proposition to Customer, value proposition to Enron, value created, imbedded optionality, required documentation, and potential targets for product and why.

Great job Sylvia...

Thanx,
Laura
