MEXICAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
----------

GREAT BRITAIN
You have two cows.
The government shoots one cow because it has Mad Cow.
The government comes back and shoots the other one because it has foot
and mouth.
----------

EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing
cows.
----------

AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair "cowgate," but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.
----------

CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income.
----------

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters
of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all
four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights
of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island
company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the
rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual
report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.
