New Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTMIs Now Available !

 
ATTENTION ALL TRADERS. We are pleased to announce the release of Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM. This latest version has many powerful new features including:
 
Quick Ticket Order Entry

Options Spreads
Custom Strip Options on WTI and Brent 1st Line Swaps

Version 8 comprises Intercontinental's latest development initiative to bring better anonymous, two-way, OTC energy products trading to the electronic marketplace.
 
Installation of Version 8 is Easy 
 
Version 8 will be available for download and installation on your system this evening, Thursday, November 15th. Live trading with Version 8 will begin on November 16th. We have already notified your System Administrators of this new release and provided them with download and installation instructions. 
 
Version 8 is backward compatible with version 7.37 and version 7.72. This means you will still be able to run these older production versions of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM, if you choose to do so. However, since many of the new features, and products like option spreads, custom option strips and weather swaps are only available on version 8, we suggest that you contact your system administrator now, to ensure you will be getting all the benefits that version 8 has to offer as soon as possible.
