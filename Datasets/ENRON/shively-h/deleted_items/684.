 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the=
 Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack C=
rockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matt=
y Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=
lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =
from a Fantasy p! er! spective.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against C=
incinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individua=
l drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play desp=
ite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.=
  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to t=
he lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprain=
ed right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practi=
ce that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return=
 bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either =
back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury rep=
ort on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against D=
etroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger =
league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary i=
s worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR!=
 -! Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be th=
e starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he=
's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - G=
iggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season des=
pite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one o=
f the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and sho=
uld be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - =
Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but=
 he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for=
 finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will A=
llen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Rus=
sell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against =
the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this seaso=
n, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post s=
olid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/16/0=
1 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good =
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that ha=
s been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aar=
on Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against Sa=
n Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be =
a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers make=
s it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defen=
se.    Willie Jackson!  , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a =
huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 ya=
rds receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnera=
ble to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option=
.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped u=
p his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushi=
ng over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fanta=
sy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is v=
ulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his la=
st three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team =
that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very=
 deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11=
/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three=
 touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary thi=
s weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is =
! wo! rth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01=
 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three =
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against =
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, =
so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is righ=
t. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid =
using him outside of de! ep! er leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's on=
ly scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England=
 secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team=
 based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - F=
rank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this seas=
on, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB =
Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wo! rt! h s=
tarting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL -=
 Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving tha=
t he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start ever=
y week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ern=
ie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few dow=
n weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With=
 the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwel=
l is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard=
 Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely sta=
rter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he split=
s carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all=
 possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes ha! d ! =
only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unr=
eliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.  =
  Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held i=
n check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight e=
nds in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past,=
 so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated =
11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six pass=
es for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past agains=
t this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   =
Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best=
 Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team=
 on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this=
 week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not =
put up huge yardage numbers! , ! but his seven touchdowns in eight games ma=
kes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your =
roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis=
.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is n=
ot listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday agai=
nst Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary i=
s vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates   Sched=
