ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.
