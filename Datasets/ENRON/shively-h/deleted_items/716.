Laura -

What do you think about setting up Enron only trading books to utilize our Enron Var?  I know that our group still has YE targets to meet and these targets become impossible if we are prevented from trading.  I think it also sends a strong signal to PGL about ENA's belief in this business.  I would like nothing more than to make the money back and not share any with PGL given their recent actions.  Let me know what you think.  I sure everyone's first instinct is to lay low and not rock the boat, but I would hate to miss a big move in NG especially since I lost money on the way up.  This could take a few days to set up.

Richard
