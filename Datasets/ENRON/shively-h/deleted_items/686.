 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles=
 Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Charger=
s. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett =
may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update=
d 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half=
 of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a F=
antasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Mc=
Nair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due=
 to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Frid=
ay, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being=
 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smit=
h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sun=
day against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee=
. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wou=
ld "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambr=
ick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the =
stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11=
/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and=
 is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However,=
 if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,=
 Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consideri=
ng as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11=
/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterb=
ack for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starti=
ng on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/1=
6/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of co=
nsistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarte=
rbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your star=
ting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/=
01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too go=
od to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end z=
one, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giant=
s' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16=
/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants du=
e to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost=
 impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu! m=
b! ers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is o=
ne of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use o=
n a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underach=
ieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB =
NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco las=
t weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsist=
ent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to b=
ench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie J=
ackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against=
 San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He=
'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass i=
n Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis=
 , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Upda! te! d 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play af=
ter beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his l=
ast four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Gi=
ve him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to =
high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Ban=
ks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three game=
s. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be b=
eaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy=
 leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbr=
ook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown pa=
sses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend tha=
t is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth conside=
ring.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been=
 held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yar=
ds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, =
so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Up=
dated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him=
 on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up =
against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outsi=
de of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt co=
ntinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only thre=
e touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this wee=
kend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his poten=
tial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/=
01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still =
one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the form=
idable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his po=
tential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01=
 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best =
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=
 solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him=
 on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at ti=
ght end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fant=
asy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russ=
ell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains=
t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin=
gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Haye=
s , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yard=
s last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners t=
his season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three =
weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had =
some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisabl=
e.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally ha=
d a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. =
Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San =
Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank =
Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the=
 league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulne=
rable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE G=
B - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers,=
 but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy playe=
r. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of ti=
ght end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fr=
ank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury repo=
rt, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play t=
his week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing t=
eams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/=
01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfiel=
d this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy va=
lue outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont=
 Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in =
place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split ca=
rries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in =
larger Fantasy leagues.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [I=
