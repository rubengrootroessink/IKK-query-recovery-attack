NEW FEATURES
from The Wall Street Journal


Dear Subscriber:

I hope you've had a chance to try out the new Wall Street Journal
Online since we introduced it January 28. If you haven't done so, I
encourage you to visit http://online.wsj.com and see what your
fellow subscribers are talking about - from home-page
personalization to improved links in articles to more intuitive
navigation.

We've seen many of you taking advantage of the personalization
features to have home-page access to your regularly used news
categories and portfolio. Remember you can set up personalization
by using Setup Center or directly from different pages of the site,
using the "Add to Personalized Home Page" link on industry and topic
pages. If you aren't seeing your portfolio on your home page, use
the "Layout" option in the Setup Center and click "Show" on the
buttons for Portfolio, then click Save Settings.

We know that with such a major step forward in design and
functionality some people may have trouble finding their favorite
content or features at first. We hope long-time subscribers will
appreciate the new labels for sections, which many users - new and
old - have indicated they find faster and more intuitive than the
original navigation.

One feature that I hope you have found by now is the "In Today's
Paper" page available from a link right below the main left-hand
section navigation. At a glance, this page allows you to see the
articles that appear on the print Journal's section pages, including
Marketplace, Money & Investing and Weekend Journal on Fridays. We
also provide links on this page to the past several days, and we're
continuing to build up the archive of previous days. (You'll also
find Page One articles listed on your home page directly below the
What's News column.)

+ Opinion is where you'll find Wall Street Journal editorials,
commentaries and op-ed columns. It's on the main section navigation.
+ Quotes & Research encompasses all of the in-depth company
information you may have known as Briefing Books. Use the upper-right
Quotes & Research form to get started.
+ Archive Search, available on the Advanced Search page linked from
below the upper-right search form, provides access into the premium
20-year archive of Journal articles and more than 6,000 other sources
formerly known as Publications Library. It's provided in conjunction
with Factiva, a Dow Jones-Reuters company.

We made substantial changes to our systems to support the new Online
Journal, and we've been working around the clock to ensure that you
find every aspect of the site a more useful experience. For more tips
on how to make the most of the new Online Journal, go to
http://public.wsj.com/tour

As always, we appreciate knowing what you think. Write me at
nbudde@wsj.com.

Sincerely,

Neil F. Budde
Publisher, The Wall Street Journal Online
