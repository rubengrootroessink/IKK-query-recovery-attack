MovieStocks are always big news on HSX. But what about the lowest and the s=
lowest? Unfortunately, most low-traders are independent films that got lost=
 in the shuffle. Sad, huh? It's easy to get overlooked on the Movie Market,=
 especially during the summer season. Here are a few MovieStocks worth ment=
ioning: *Time and Tide (TTIDE ) - This actioner about Hong Kong street thug=
s has been virtually ignored since its IPO and has fallen to H$.90. *Shadow=

 H$.48. *Sexy Beast (SXYBS ) - This story of a gangster with a rocky marria=
ge has yet to spark trader interest. It's available at the bargain basement=
 price of H$.80. *Chopper (CHOPR ) - Priced at H$.54, this black comedy abo=
