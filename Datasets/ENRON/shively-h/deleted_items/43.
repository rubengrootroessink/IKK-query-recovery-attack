Tom and Phillip,
 
Let me know what your thoughts are on the arrangement of the Southwest.  Lavo informed Scott last night that the ERCOT desk would not be located next to Gas.  
 
Scott and Hunter,
 
What are your thoughts on switching areas with each other.  It might be nice to have central next to Frankie Ermis and the rockies boys.  East would then be that much closer to Nymex.
 
Just a sketch.  Let me know what you think.
 
Grigsby
