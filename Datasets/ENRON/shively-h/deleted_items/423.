Laura,
Vlady has requested that I take over the CRO function for Enovate.  I'm thinking about traveling to Chicago next week to review related market risk issues, and get a feel for any other risk issues.  Additionally, what do you think about getting together with some of the People's people?    Any other suggestions or ideas to add/take off my agenda?

Frank
