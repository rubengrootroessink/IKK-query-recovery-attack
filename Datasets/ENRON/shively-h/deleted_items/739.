, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
 h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration=
 in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Update=
d 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy F=
ootball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last t=
wo games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   To=
m Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichic=
k announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for=
 the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe t=
o a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady mig=
ht have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fa=
irly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11=
/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seas=
on due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to=
 rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abs=
ence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more =
by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's g=
ame against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 =
game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at=
 split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell ,=
 QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sidel=
ine him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours bef=
ore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a=
 strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will=
 start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as y=
ou set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor=
 received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin =
injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of =
the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that th=
e injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, an=
d in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of=
 the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again th=
is Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final=
 decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , W=
R DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough=
 for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss T=
hursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravat=
ed it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith=
 on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bronc=
os' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it wo=
uld be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/=
20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexa=
nder will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during th=
eir charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the=
 Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriot=
s will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No=
. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Bra=
dy is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster=
 as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadricep=
s) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  R=
icky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has n=
ot sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times .=
 He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun=
 Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as th=
e postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/=
01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy i=
nvolving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback=
," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none=
 within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us=
 the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to =
satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder i=
njury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bru=
ener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Ty=
rone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-=
Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to =
play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Kinney =
(calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to ret=
urn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11=
/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's pr=
actice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to mi=
ss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to st=
art against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 M=
innis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may hav=
e to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game ag=
ainst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome=
 Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the seas=
on. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting,=
 meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lin=
eup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the=
 Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray=
 right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star=
ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur=
nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Sh=
anahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed t=
o play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evalu=
ate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he ca=
n help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't=
 perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him =
out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Update=
d 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how m=
uch Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in som=
e of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend again=
st Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wid=
e receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Bank=
s , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will s=
tart Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion l=
ast weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury=
 and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free =
Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on=
 Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is bes=
t used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Upda=
ted 11/20/01  Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the over=
time session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't c=
onsidered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lin=
