Hunter,

Here is the list for Gas Fundamentals and a note about each person:

1. Dipak Agarwalla - essential to the group for modeling and statistics
2. Biliana Pehlivanova - would put her in charge of supply
3. Jozef Lieskovsky - would put him in charge of consumption
4. Adam Bayer - ops reports expertise/desk fundamentals
5. Vladi Pimenov - would put him in charge of desk fundamentals
6. Denver Plachy - hardest worker in fundamentals to date - would work on supply
7. Justin O'Malley - best resource on ops reports - he was in the group when they were built
8. Patrick Tucker - met with him briefly twice - would have him work with the supply/consumption teams
9. Brian Falik - best resource on economic research
10. Bart Burk - helped Dipak build the power stack models
11. Virawan Yawapongsiri - has not expressed interest in coming back to fundamentals
12. Jeremy Buss - limited exposure to fundamentals - I have trouble moving him up the list due my experience with the names above
13. Brent Dornier - introduced to him once - I have trouble moving him up the list due to my experience with the names above

Let me know if you wish to discuss.

Chris
