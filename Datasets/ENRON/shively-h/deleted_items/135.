Dear Subscriber:

I am pleased to invite you to a sneak preview of our redesigned and
enhanced edition of The Wall Street Journal Online, with superior site
organization, easier-to-use features and better performance for faster

Rest assured, all the up-to-the-minute, exclusive Journal news and
information you rely on remains center stage. We're simply unveiling
the next-generation Online Journal, which offers NEW FEATURES FROM US -
and DRAMATIC NEW BENEFITS FOR YOU.

You'll find this state-of-the-art site includes many of the enhancements
you've been asking for, including your own PERSONALIZED HOME PAGE that
gives you control of the information that matters most to you while
still providing a concise picture of the top news from the Journal
newsroom. You'll also find an incredibly effective site organization
that makes finding what you want not just easy but effortless.

Specifically, the new Online Journal includes:

==New Organization==
We've reorganized the site to better meet your needs, with all-new main
sections and additions such as News by Industry. You'll also find more
related links on article pages, improved site navigation and pages that
surface more information yet require less scrolling.

==More Personalization==
Here's where the new Online Journal really shines. Create your own
customized home page, with one-click access to the topics you're
interested in. Put your favorite portfolio, company news, industries,
market data and more right on your home page so you'll always have a
completely up-to-date view of the information that matters most to you.
To be ready for the change please be sure and update your current
Personal Journal listings today.

==Better Searching==
We've added our search options to every page, making it simple for you
to expand your knowledge and tap into our improved search results. We've
also revamped our Quotes & Research area, giving you access to detailed
financial information on more than 30,000 companies and funds.

==More Convenience==
You'll be able to conduct tasks such as e-mailing, saving and printing
properly formatted articles on demand.

This new edition of the Online Journal is the result of months of
in-depth interviews with our subscribers and exhaustive research and
testing, as well as comments from subscribers over the past six years.
I believe you'll find the Online Journal truly comes of age with the
introduction of these new benefits. I hope you'll take a moment to
preview the site even before it rolls out in late January. Our advance
tour is available at:
