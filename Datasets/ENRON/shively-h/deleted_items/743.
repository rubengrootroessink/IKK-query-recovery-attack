, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai=
nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week=
s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti=
nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/0=
1 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards =
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be=
ca! us! e of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi=
s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=
 Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t=
he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo=
r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie =
RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=
 now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the b=
all six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good nu=
mbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKa=
y Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, an=
d caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although hi=
s owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaD=
ainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o=
f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook=
ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'=
s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a=
 solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. How=
ever, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake=
 Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01Plummer had a decent outing on Su=
nday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who als=
o threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David B=
oston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding =
game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. =
He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth=
 starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catch=
es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy =
receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - =
Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c=
arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often =
in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=
 for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=
 may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S=
mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens=
e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec=
ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE =
- Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the=
 Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the =
most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggr=
avating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not =
return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moul=
ds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yard=
s and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners shou=
ld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the yea=
r. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medi=
ocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van=
 Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one inte=
rception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as h=
e remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=
 not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable =
to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle=
r , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs a=
nd no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a =
QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fa=
ntasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins =
held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interc=
eptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet pe=
rformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo=
ur passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be=
 a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner =
, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only =
33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few=
 weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana=
 Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action =
on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 time=
s for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy te=
am. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR =
CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhs=
in Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absen=
ce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.  =
 Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S! un! =
day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next we=
ekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexand=
er , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 ya=
rds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander m=
ay continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chan=
dler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on S=
unday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to a=
ttack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's =
poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/0=
1 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.=
 He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappoi=
ntment if he stays healthy.  More Updates  Transactions, View  [IMAGE]     =
