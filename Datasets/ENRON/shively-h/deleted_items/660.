Hunter, 

I have been thinking through the combinations of Analysts and Associates and wanted to run this grouping by you:

Supply - Sachin Gandhi (Lead), Catalina Cardenas, Neeran Pathak
Consumption (including Power) - Virawan Yawaponsiri (Lead), Tara Piazze, Sabina Rank, Abhijeet Naik, Bart Burk
STP - Mat Smith (Lead), Biliana Pehlivanova, Denver Plachy, Justin O'Malley, Nate Blackburn, Lauren Schlesinger

Mat Smith has been filling in for Tori Kuykendall while she is on maternity leave, and is only available part time for the fundamentals group.  I put strong resources in the STP group (Biliana, Denver, and Lauren) in order to create some momentum there.  All three of the people in the lead positions will rotate out of the group within three months.  If I had to choose leads today for when the rotations occurred, I would put Justin over the STP group, Lauren over the Consumption group, and leave the supply lead vacant.  Let me know what you think.

Chris
