Dear Johnny Palmer,

I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, specializing on
statistics.  I have worked at Citizens Power (now Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading) since April of this year developing software for their
trading desk and risk management department.

In particular, I have implemented state-of-the-art
procedures to price derivative contracts on gas and electricity, and
worked on default correlations among counterparties.

Attached is a html copy of my vita.

Sincerely,


Carlos J. Morales
Department of mathematics and Statistics
Boston University
