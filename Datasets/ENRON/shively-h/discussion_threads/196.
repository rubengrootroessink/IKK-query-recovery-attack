Title: Bouncing Above Oil
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2356


NATURAL GAS PRICES WILL BE SUSTAINED ABOVE $5.00

This spring and summer will present a major challenge to natural gas=20
markets--refilling storage inventories while meeting underlying growth from=
=20
power
demand. Achieving these goals will require some demand to be held off of th=
e
market, which will in turn require gas prices to remain above those of
distillate fuel oil.

* CERA expects April to have the strongest injections since 1998.

* Gas prices will remain close to those of distillate through the end of
May.

* Prices will be volatile, as the market is still in a precarious
situation.
