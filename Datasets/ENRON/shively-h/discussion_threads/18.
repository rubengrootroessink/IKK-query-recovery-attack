I wanted to give you a quick status update:

Space for Thursday  I've secured eb2601 all day.
Tim's needs  LCD projector and 1 PC.  He will bring all the software he needs 
on CD.  (Tim said he didn't need the Web or SQL server but I'm getting them 
anyway.)
Web Test Server  Online and standing by.  I will also have an Admin on call.
SQL Test Server  Being built out today with an ETA of Tuesday to be online.
Server Room on 32  Waiting on information from facilities and hope to get an 
answer today.
Developer   Identified 2 possible candidates and will have a definitive 
answer by end of day Monday.
Enron Net Works Shirts 3 will be delivered to you today.


I need an RC and CO # to charge equipment against.  I will send quote to you 
for approval before ordering.

Regards, John
