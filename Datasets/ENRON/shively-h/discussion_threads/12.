Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.
