Here are the pipeline expansions within or out of the Rockies:


Pipeline Capacity  In Service Date  Delivery Region
CIG    50,000Dth/d   Fall 2001  Mid Continent
Trail Blazer 150,000Dth/d  Fall 2002  Mid Continent   
WIC Med. Bow 500,000Dth/d  Fall 2001  Rockies (Cheyenne Hub)
Kern River 125,000 Dth/d  Summer 2002  So Cal Border

Pipeline Expansions Currently in Open Season
Pipeline Capacity  In Service Date  Delivery Region
Coastal
Connection 540,000 Dth/d  Fall 2003  Mid Continent

Williams 540,000 Dth/d  Fall 2003  Mid Continent

Northern 
Border  340,000 Dth/d  Fall 2003  Mid Continent via Northern Border

All these proposed pipelines currently have no firm contractual commitments, 
we believe only one project will be built and that the true in-service date 
is sometime in 2004.  It takes 36 months from start to finish, for these 
green field projects.
