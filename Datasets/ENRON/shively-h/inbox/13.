Here are the office locations that Louise has assigned:

Calger	06105
Presto	06103
Shively	06102

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up?

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful!

Thanks for your help!
Tammy

Tammy,

Chris indicated on Friday that he has an office on this floor.  Please let me know the location so I can have his office set up at a later date.

Thanking you in advance.
