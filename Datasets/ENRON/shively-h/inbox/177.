[IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/2=
7/01 Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third=
 straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his=
 quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably=
 a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Da=
vis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from=
 arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He =
will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptica=
l the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting bot=
h players' Fantasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27=
/01 Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for S=
unday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in h=
is place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR=
 DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is que=
stionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Bronc=
os might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on=
 Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter=
 Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated=
 Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Ben=
jamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't =
go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach =
Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rac=
kers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goa=
ls this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. =
1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, =
but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith =
, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said =
Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The =
Cincinnati Enquirer . "If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengal=
s need to get rid of me," Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's =
used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's=
 important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt=
.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with=
 a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losi=
ng Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the =
starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reser=
ve list or play in a deeper league.  M! o! e Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the inju=
ry to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a=
 running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect =
him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brooki=
ns , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot rev=
ealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at=
 least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes=
 the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roste=
r in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Ch=
rebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The N=
ew York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jak=
e Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by =
the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin Jame=
s , RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' =
surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday =
in Miami.  Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthu=
r Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it we=
nt very well," Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured=
 the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oc=
t. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is=
 expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either o=
f the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said wh=
ether James will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn ,=
 WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he=
 doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of h=
is season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached i=
t yet," coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if=
 the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as=
 each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer."      Shayne Graham , K SEA=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kic=
ker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-=
after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle S=
eahawks before the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury,=
 returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playi=
ng time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season=
. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-=
Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing wi=
th an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He ha=
d three catches for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Upd=
ated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win ove=
r Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I co=
uldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." B=
arlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure t=
o place him on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01=
 Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprain=
ed left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec=
! ti! ve boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time th=
is week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners fa=
ce Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason=
 suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He misse=
d practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. =
The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald D=
river , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive f=
or three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Mond=
ay. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on =
your Fantasy team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated=
 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will =
likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Dependi=
ng on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured r=
eserve or cut him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/=
27/01 Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against =
Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time=
 posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the =
lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   =
Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detro=
it Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago de=
spite a groin injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg s=
aid. "He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the =
injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll =
likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is =
a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01=
 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. T=
he veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - M=
artin Upda! te! d 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status f=
or Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if T=
homas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until late=
r in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover =
(neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers=
 are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.=
   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent p=
lay and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is s=
ecure. "There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful t=
hat have gone through times like this," coach George Seifert told the Charl=
otte Observer. "Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't =
turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately=
, it will be more beneficial than not." While he may be the starting quarte=
rback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues=
.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left =
Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is quest=
ionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimi=
stic that he'll be available for the game. "I'll be there," Sanders told th=
e Arizona Republic. "They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and=
 jumping - normal wear and tear." In any event, keeping Sanders on your ben=
ch may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR=
 ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some=
 light running last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He ha=
sn't made a lot of progress," coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic=
. "We're going to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decis=
ion." Moore, who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be place=
d on the injured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright =
