I just wanted to confirm the first meeting of the Analyst/Associate Committee on Monday, March 26 from 8:00-10:00 am in the 50th Floor Dining Room (eb50m).  You will find an agenda for the meeting below, as well as attachments containing a recent overview of the program by business unit, and the results of an October 2000 survey of program participants.  This information should help you prepare for our meeting.

Feel free to contact me at x36671 if you would like to discuss anything prior to the meeting.  I look forward to working with each of you.

Regards,
Billy
