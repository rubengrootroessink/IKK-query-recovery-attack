Hunter,

We need three additional people in August/September to fill out the groups at current staffing levels.  We lose two Associates and three Analysts on Aug. 1 and one Associate and two Analysts on Sep. 1.  I have been working with the Assoc/Analyst program over the past few weeks and have already picked up 3 new Analysts for August 1.  We also get Bilal Bajwa and Jason Wolfe for their second trading track rotations, Bilal starts on Aug 1 and Jason on Sep. 1.

Leaving Aug 1 - Virawan Yawaponsiri, Sabina Rank, Nate Blackburn, Tara Piazze, Abhijeet Naik
Leaving Sep 1 - Sachin Gandhi, Denver Plachy, Mat Smith

Starting Aug 1 - Bilal Bajwa (Trading Track), Sheila Chang(Rice), Adam Bayer(Vanderbilt), Aaron Berutti (Vanderbilt)

Need - 3 Assoc/Analysts for Aug/Sep start date (I prefer Analysts)

Chris

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John
