Hunter,

My name is Adrian Clark and I am an executive recruiter in the energy
industry.  One of my industry sources referred you to me and said you were
the head of a trading desk there.  My firm, First Call Associates, searches
for qualified candidates for energy trading and marketing companies across
North America and Europe.  I am curious to know if you would be interested
in discussing new job opportunities we are working on.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies enabling us to present
qualified employees for their consideration.

Be assured that any information we discuss will be completely confidential.
My apologies for sending this to your email at work but I have not been
successful reaching you during business hours.
