Hunter,

We secured 2 from the trading track schedule attached (George Huan, Gary Linhart).  The other two (Brent Dornier, Scott Freeman) are going to the West Desk.

We would be left with 6 thru Aug 2002:
Aaron Berutti
Adam Bayer
Shiela Chang
Jeremy Lo
Brian Falik
Jason Huang

I have one new hire starting in late December from Wellesley (she was an intern in Gossett's group last summer).  I would need to hire 4 people to replace the February rotations.  Talking to the group this morning, they are already asking if they can stay on past their rotation dates, as many want to stay on the gas floor.  Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss.

Chris

 << File: Trading Track  Rotations Novembern 7th.xls >> 

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotatons for the internal new hires.    Following your changes/comments/suggestions I will forward to Lavorato so we can finalise with the analysts and associates.

Thanks, karen.
