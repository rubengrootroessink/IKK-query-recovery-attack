Hunter,

I've left a message on your voice mail, too.

I'm the editor of two UBS intranet sites where we post "news" stories
of interest to our employees. These sites are strictly internal.

I'm putting together a story about tomorrow's mock trading session and
need to speak with you -- and others you might suggest -- to get a
feeling for what's going on there.

I'm basically looking for you to describe the atmosphere describe a
picture of the scene to me.

Thanks, in advance, for all your help.

Sid Karpoff
