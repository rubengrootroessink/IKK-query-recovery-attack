 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for=
 him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for =
another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a k=
ey performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Dou=
g Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego U=
nion-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew=
 Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about=
 controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is ou=
r quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." S=
till, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  M=
ark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the re=
st of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely a=
ffect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the =
best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - G! ig!=
 gles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer=
 being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week =
after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this=
 week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will=
 be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Ste=
ve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair=
's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday.=
 Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this =
week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (rib=
s) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marv=
in Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Minnis (ankle) is list=
ed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his pla=
ce,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) =
might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again=
 if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 B=
runell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Qu=
inn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful f=
or Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in=
 his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) i=
s done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (kne=
e) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back in=
to the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dav=
e Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fi=
elder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. `=
`Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared a=
way and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated =
11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suffi=
ciently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a=
 chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver=
 Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situatio=
n where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, t=
hen we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis wo=
n't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get h=
im involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett=
 , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury =
last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia=
. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this =
point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setb=
acks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffe=
red a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after eff=
ects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gre=
en , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to =
return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent th=
is season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens =
, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and a=
nkle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. T=
he injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be=
 in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday=
's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected =
to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value=
 as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/2=
0/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-r=
epaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fa=
ct, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cri=
s Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on =
a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the=
 rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 T=
he Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as=
 the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start f=
or most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=
 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thurs=
day's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fant=
asy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01=
 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after under=
going knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Ba=
ltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than =
usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter =
Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will li=
kely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll hel=
p keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to giv=
e Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL -=
 Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game agai=
nst Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smi=
th told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbe=
rs due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all pos=
sible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered b=
ruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some pr=
actice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlan=
ta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could=
 turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week a=
fter missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain=
 to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a=
 hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only=
 worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright =
