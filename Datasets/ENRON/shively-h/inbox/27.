Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions.

Chris
