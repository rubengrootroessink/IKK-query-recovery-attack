Currently, I am a Commercial Director working for Greg Piper in the estate.  I am contacting you regarding your potential need for individuals with strong trading, risk management, commercial and negotiation skills and expertise.  

The following bullet points my skill sets:

Proprietary Trading and P&L management responsibilities: Natural Gas (responsible for all financial, physical, futures and options nat gas trading in my region)
Demand side risk management:  Natural Gas (Managed price and logistical risk for 120 production facilities in North America)
Extensive and long-term industry contacts

Strong negotiation skills 

Prior to recent events, Fletch Sturm approached me to trade power for Enron.  If you have any interest in discussing this further, I will send you my resume and set up a time to talk.  

Sincerely,
