Garrett Trip from our Ontario office is coming down Monday.  Let's meet with him to discuss Lennox.  I will set up meeting room for Tueday 2:00.  How does that sound?  Will you be able to attend? 
Thanks

Justin,

This is Garrett on the Ontario Power Desk.  I will be in the Houston office spending time with the East Power Desk next week.  Let's set up a time for you to run through your Ontario Gas burn model.  Farouk and I do not need a great deal of specific information,  just enough to identify when Lennox is burning gas, and approximately how much.  Monday and Tuesday afternoon are good times for me, reply when you are available.
