Bob, et al,

Please forward all PEC/NS/Aruba related documents to the attention of Kay Chapman with the estate.  This would include all transportation agreements, binders, etc.  If anyone has a full set/copy of the transportation agreements, please respond to this e-mail.  They need to go on a plane to Chicago later today.  We need to ensure these documents remain with the estate due to confidentiality provisions with PEC.

As always, thanks for your assistance.

Thanx,

Laura
