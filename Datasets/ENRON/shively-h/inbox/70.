Please find the most recent development of site track reports from Wei Tai here :

http://egmfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/sitetrack

The following additions have been added to this release 
Group Total Usage report (displays # of hits by group)
Topic level report in Group Total Usage report, displaying activity by the top node of the crumb
User activity drill through on all reports displaying user data

Wei is currently developing graphs, as well as the ability to exclude groups from reports.

Performance is noticeably slow right now, but we will be optimizing the queries for the production version.
Please review and let us know of any issues you might come across.

Thanks,

Dave Dronet
