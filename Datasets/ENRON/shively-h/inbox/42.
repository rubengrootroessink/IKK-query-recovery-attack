Bill Read...Meteorologist-in-Charge...NWS Houston      281-337-5074   ext. 222  (Was looking at the job description and thinking about it for himself or if he had someone 									          else to suggest)

Mark Walquist...Sr. Forecaster...Wilkens Weather       713-430-7100  (Work number...may not be able to talk in detail with him there...worried about job security)

John Lewis...Lead Forecaster...NWS Little Rock          501-985-2853  (Home phone number...indicated liked where he was...maybe you can be more persuasive)

Steve Bennett is working on getting us in touch with Steve Lyons and possibly some other Weather Channel forecasters.  I have left 2 messages with Elliot Abrams...Lead Forecaster at AccuWeather.  He works the early morning shift and I asked him to email me or call me.  Robert Ricks is due in for an interview early next week.  Dave Ryan is contacting Matt Rogers at Eartsat.
