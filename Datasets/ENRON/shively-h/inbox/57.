Please find attached the below referenced budget for NETCO for Weather.  Included currently are primarily the basic employee costs based on average salaries and wages and average run rates (based on Sept 2001 YTD costs) for other types of expenses for the current Research department.  It is very important that any additional costs specific to your department which you feel are not represented in this budget be added at this time.  Please review this budget and confirm to me your agreement or any changes or additions to it by 3:00 pm today.

Please feel free to contact me at X30669 with any questions you have regarding this information.

Thank you,
Edie Leschber
Manager, Financial Operations

Faith Killen is putting together the new budget for Netco.  I would like to emphasize that you need to include all of your costs of restart (new software licences, additional legal support etc).  Please work with Faith to validate the numbers she is producing for January 3, 2002.

Thanks

Louise
