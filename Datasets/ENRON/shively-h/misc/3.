Andy - can you please forward this email to your book person to change these attached deals from ENA- PGL  to ENA - and the actual counterparty.  Our confirmation guys should send out a confirm to verify these deals.

Tony is continuing to look for additional Harper \ northern border supplies.  I will let you know if he finds anything of interest.
