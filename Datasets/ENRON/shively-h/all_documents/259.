has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would 
work like this:

Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable 
injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer
Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable 
injection    .015 bid     .025 offer

I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a 
try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.
