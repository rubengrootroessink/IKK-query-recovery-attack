For your review, I have attached a list of individuals and the days they need 
to arrive.  The first group arriving on Saturday will have the option of 
playing golf or going to the spa.   They will begin their workshops on Sunday 
morning and will be departing on Monday morning.   The group arriving on 
Sunday will have the same option.  They will begin their workshops on Monday 
morning and departing on Tuesday.  

There is a Dinner on Sunday night at 8:30 for everyone to attend. 


Please let me know if you will be travelling outside of these travel dates, 
as well as if you are interested in Golf or the spa.  

Thanks,
Lynn
