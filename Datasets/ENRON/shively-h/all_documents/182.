Subject: Lake Temp. Affect Theory

A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the 
Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that 
the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off 
the colder Lakes.  
Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous
Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ??
May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...

It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great
lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can 
investigate.

Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet....
