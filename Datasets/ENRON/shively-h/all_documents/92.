Hunter,

I wanted your opinion on how to respond to the following e-mail.  It sounds 
like Caroline Abramo is sharing some of Mike's research and the Fundamentals 
research with some of the hedge funds.  Do we want to keep sending her the 
information or limit it to certain pieces of research.  Do we make any/enough 
money off of their business to provide them with our internal research?  I 
have told her in the past that the quarterly production numbers that we 
provide are for internal use only, but it sounds like some of the information 
is going outside of Enron.  Let me know what you think.

Chris

Chris - this is feedback on Elena's sheets - the ones she puts together as 
part of Mike Robert's Monday package.  I think they have real potential to be 
very valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is 
from Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years 
and who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major 
tenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he 
has done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how 
much comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also 
wholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see 
prices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production 
numbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the 
historical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes 
in production have been.

The info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do 
not share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that 
we can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading 
strategies

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY 
but I am working on it.  I am sure a lot of this info is up there.

Subject: RE: industrials


what do the ally cutbacks mean in mcf per day
what is the impact of the integrated steel plants running at 70% of capacity
(number released weekly) mean to power demand and hence demand for nat gas
what is going on re. nat gas liquids being stripped out? i.e. dynegy and
mitchell etc. have all announced full or partial closures of stripping
facilities as economics aren't there.  someone shld be tracking what this
means in mcf per day
why won't utilities give you utilization of plants by fuel type, as they do
in nuclear, so you can track power demand by fuel type
how much nat gas demand is being lost cuz nat gas ethylene producers have
shut down as margins are too low vs. their naptha based competitors.  etc.
etc.
where do we stand on switching vs. resid, diesel etc. etc.


i could go on, but i think i've made my point; what is in the report is
good, but it's incomplete and not totaled with some summary conclusions.
it's only the very easy, first derivative demands/closures.  it could add
real value by looking for alternative data points that aren't as easily
tracked by the market.

D- not sure if we ever showed this to you- once a week we update all the
plant closures for ammonia, methanol, and aluminium smelters and the
resulting gas and power that's back on the market.  these pages are in back
of the weather.  please let me know what you think of these- elena, our
analyst in houston is always looking for feedback which is hard to get
because the report only circulates internally.
