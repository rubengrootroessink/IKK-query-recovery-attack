I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If 
the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every 
"Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the 
Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a 
problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura 
manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above 
agreement.

Thanks
Hunter
