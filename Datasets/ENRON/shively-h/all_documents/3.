> A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting. "I used some
horrible

you

>
> "Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it
was
> going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was
hanging
> over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
> about
> 100 yards."
>
> "Is that when you swore?"  "No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a
> squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and
began

>
> "Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.  "Well, no."
> says
> the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out
of
> the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!"
>
> "Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.  "No, not yet. As
the
> eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the  green
and
> the squirrel dropped my ball."
>
> "Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
>
> "No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
> rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."
>
> The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed and
> said,
> "You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?"
