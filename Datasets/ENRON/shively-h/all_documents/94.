I know coordinating these moves is a real pain, but we have 4 commercial 
individuals that need to be sitting at the East gas desk: Frank Vickers, Gil 
Muhl, Phil Demoes, David Jones. Effective Jan. 1, they are part of the East 
gas team, and it's critical they sit with them. Could you get with Scott and 
Hunter and see what else can be done? Thanks.

Ina,

Have you made other arrangements for Frank's group or do we need to get 
together and try to come up with a "quick fix"?  I know before when I was up 
there inquiring about this, you had said that you were working on this same 
request for Scott Neal, so I wanted to check with you first before doing 
anything.

Thanks

   Lorie, 

   Adam is on the churn for tonite.  However...Colin Tonks has laid claimed 
for those spaces with Hunter Shively's approval. 

   Also, thought you might need to know that with Adam's departure, that 
makes only three desks available (3247c,d and e). 

   3247a & b are currently being occupied by employees of Chris Gaskill with 
no plans to move to the best of my knowledge. 

    This of course, still leaves Kim Brown looking for (3) spaces on 32.   

   Additionally,  regarding Brenda Herod, her final count is (30) 
consultants, (26) current employees and (9) to be hired in January.  

  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance, 
  Heather, x33278

Heather,

Is Adam's group on the churn for tonight?  Does this mean the spaces will 
become available to Frank Vickers and others after tonight?

Thanks

Lorie

  Per Marcie's email below, Adam Plager and his group will be moving out of 
their current locations
  on 32 and will be moving to 25.  

  I will follow-up with Marcie and make sure she knows there is space 
reserved for them on the 1/2/01 churn. 

  Happy New Year! : ) Heather

Heather:  Thanks for your message.  I totally understand the circumstances.  
I have found space for Adam and his group on 25 and am in the process of 
moving him hopefully this week as your needs suggest.

Marcy Babb  --  Have a GREAT New Year!

  Marcy,  

  Today,  Adam Plager was asked to find a space off of the 32nd floor, 
effective Jan. 2, 2000.  
   
  As I am sending you this email, we do not know where to move him.  I have 
contacted 
  Lorie Belsha who handles the majority of the floor planning and their are 
no spaces to
  move him.  She advised that we look to find a space with his direct report 
Bryan Powell 
  and asked me to contact Peggy McCurley, who then advised I talk to Cheri 
Westbrook. 
  When talking to Cheri Westbrook, she indicated that you have some space 
allocated 
  to you, but she was unsure if you have specific plans for them or if you 
would have (4) 
  spaces for Adam, to accomodate his immediate need.  

  I will be out of the office when you are back in on Wednesday, please 
advise Adam if 
  there is any space available.  I will call in to see if I can be of further 
assistance in this 
  search. 

  To help you expedite this process when you have come back (in hopes that 
you 
  have space available for Adam), I have attached the churn request.  You 
will need to 
  fill in the areas that I left blank (i.e, titles for new hires, cost 
center, TO location).  All the 
  equipment to be moved has been entered on the churn.  

  Additionally, when sending the request into the move-team, please say " 
This move 
  request is for the (5) spaces reserved by Heather Choate for the January 2, 
2001 churn".  

  

 Regards,
