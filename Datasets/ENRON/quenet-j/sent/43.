what's up big guy? 
 
hope your holiday went well ..............

we close on our "new" new house on wednesday...................... old mr. 
Pulte couldn't take up the carpet and lay down the floor so he now owns one 
of his own homes again. We now own a home by Village Builders in wood creek. 
Bigger home, better rate......Anyway, now we can ride together with the wives 
and dogs when go back up to visit Rob and Sherry's parents ranch......We went 
up on saturday, 1 hr north of Rob's house....up near Magnolia.......900 acres 
....nice house on to of the hill, overlooking the lake , the horses, the 
cattle, ....the inground pool ( simba's favorite place) the other 5 dogs 
wanted no part of the pool.......

 Turns out, the ranch is just a "weekend getaway"..........along with the new 
house on lake conroe "weekend". and the beach house on south padre 
Island."weekend also".......Dad was a private practice Doctor of family 
medicine......great guy......we ( you and me) need to get back up there with 
the families.....great place to sit outside , suck down beer and get covered 
with mud......simba hasn't woken up in 2 days ....think she's ok ????
