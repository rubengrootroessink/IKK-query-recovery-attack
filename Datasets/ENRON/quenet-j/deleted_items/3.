Why certainly...... I will have to deduct my 75% administrative processing
fee from the monies received....

Thank you for being so prompt in attending to these matters.  Until we meet

I CONTACTED BETA FINANCE, I OWE THEM ABOUT 250 OUT OF 600 BALANCE. I
ALSO CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT CONTROLS OUR DAYCARE CLAIM FORMS. THEY
SAID IF WE COULD GET A STATEMENT FROM CREME SHOWING ALL THE PAYMENTS
MADE IN 2001, I CAN COLLECT ALL THE MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT.      SO
THEREFORE, CAN YOU ASK THE PEOPLE AT CREME IF THEY CAN PROVIDE US WITH
THIS INFO ?

LATER.
