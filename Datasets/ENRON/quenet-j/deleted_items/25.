   Hey,

   I just got an email from Linda McKula (we went to her wedding in Napa);
   anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be having
   a
   baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things have
   gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful that
   they
   still have jobs (for now).  Later.

   I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from
   11-3; so
   let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.
