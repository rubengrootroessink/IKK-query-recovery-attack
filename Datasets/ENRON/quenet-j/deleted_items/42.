Hey, I just got a call from Debra (Concordia, KS); they are coming down to
Houston for a visit in 3 weeks.  They are going to see us, Debra's sister
and then Gary's daughter so they wanted to pencil us in for Wed. Nov 14th -
Thurs 15th.  Try and take off on Thurs 15th so we can spend some time with
them......

Later
