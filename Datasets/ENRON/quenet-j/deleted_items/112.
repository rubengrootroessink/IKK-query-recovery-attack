orter 10/19/2001 06:59 AM  EDT  1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?  One beneficia=
ry of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY :OTC  BB ADR - news  - com=
mentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the German chemical maker, which has =
seen its share price gain 10.4% since  the terrorist attacks. But investors=
 bidding up the stock might be getting  ahead of themselves.    Bayer makes=
 Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for Cipro is =
high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of  the company's overal=
l revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year  (and, according to a=
nalysts, will increase even more this year, due to its  acquisition of Aven=
tis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the dema=
nd for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S.  sales of the drug to be =
approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.     [IMAGE] [IMAGE]border=3D0 hei=
ght=3D"280" width=3D"336">   [IMAGE]  Even emergency purchases of Cipro  pr=
obably won't add that much to Bayer's overall revenues. The president  has =
asked for $643 million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks.  Whi=
le it's possible that sum will be increased, not all the money would be  sp=
ent on Cipro.    Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the on=
ly producer  of Cipro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, th=
ere's some  pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic v=
ersion from  other manufacturers.    On another front, Bayer is currently b=
attling a class-action lawsuit  related to an anti-cholesterol drug implica=
ted in a number of deaths. It  was forced to withdraw the drug from the mar=
ket.    Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean i=
t's  a refuge for investors.    2. Losses at Twice the Price  You know thin=
gs are bad for a company when its losses per share are  double the price of=
 the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO :Nasdaq  =
- news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the supply-chain softwa=
re maker. After market close on Tuesday, the company posted   losses under =
generally accepted accounting principles that amounted to  $5.5 billion, or=
 $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all  charges.    In ot=
her words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share  price, =
which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.    Much of the huge writedow=
n reflects amortized goodwill from the  purchase of Aspect Development in M=
arch 2000.    To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisi=
tions like  i2 typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges=
 and extraordinary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so=
  bad: The company met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.=
3  million, or 13 cents per share.    Still, investors met i2's earnings wi=
th disapproval, knocking the stock  down 25% the day after they were report=
ed.    3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks  In times like these, there's comfort i=
n knowing business goes on as  usual at many U.S. companies. Just like the =
old days, Microsoft (MSFT :Nasdaq  - news  -  commentary   - research   - a=
nalysis)   is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competito=
r.    It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with =
 the words "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software =
 maker Novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false=
  and misleading statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.   Amo=
ng the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged  food. F=
or example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a  line o=
n the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare pla=
tform?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly  funny engi=
neers.)    The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software t=
o consulting services, which Novell says isn't true.    Microsoft spokesman=
 Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily  intended to advertise Mic=
rosoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was  all in the theme of a mock =
cereal box," he said. "It was a modest  campaign."    In response to Novell=
's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter  in September to recipie=
nts of the boxes to clarify some of its statements,  and it's just agreed t=
o send another letter to appease the company. For  the record, Novell said =
it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified  money damages.    4. AMD'=
s Feisty Pledge  CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probab=
ly would be  too much to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes =
their oratorical rough edges cross the line into embarrassing.    Case in p=
oint: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD :=
NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  which earlier thi=
s week reported a loss for the first time in almost three  years. The compa=
ny, facing harsh pricing competition from Intel (INTC :Nasdaq  - news  -  c=
ommentary   - research   - analysis) ,  said its revenue was down 22% from =
a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the fourth quarter.  =
  Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to  =
be extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference  cal=
l, he indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-calle=
d "Hammer" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel  that wh=
en the upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."    Does this guy carry aroun=
d a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders,  meet Mr. Reeves .    OK, so=
 we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But  his comm=
ent seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will  look bette=
r when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime  soon, wha=
t matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges  notwithst=
anding.    5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style  Analysts have complained for=
 some time about Enron's (ENE :NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   -=
 analysis)   rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company pro=
duced results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they=
 came  from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has=
 gotten even more unsettling.    To cap off its disappointing earnings resu=
lts this week -- Enron posted  a steep loss after taking a $1.01 billion ch=
arge -- the company let drop  that its shareholder equity had decreased by =
$1.2 billion.    In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduc=
tion in equity to the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares=
." According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased  55 =
million shares issued through a series of transactions involving LJM  Capit=
al, a partnership that until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.    TSC'=
s Peter Eavis has written   that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy Enr=
on stock.    Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this w=
eek that  it had expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to=
 quiet  its accounting critics.    Enron's transactions have been so labyri=
nthine that it's hard to identify exactly if or how they were inappropriate=
. But the latest  revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the=
 company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, h=
ad seen  its stock fall 59% for the year leading up to its latest earnings =
release.  Since then, it's dropped another 12.6%     Read our conflicts and=
