Joe,

Attached is my current resume along with a background summary:

I joined Electronic Data Systems (EDS) over 12 years ago and have supported
numerous accounts in diverse industries both in a technical and business
role.  I would like to gain exposure in the energy industry and do not have
an opportunity to do so within EDS. As a result, I've decided to seek a new
opportunity.   The following profile may be helpful in identifying potential
opportunities:

Desired Position(s):	Application Analyst, Business Analyst,
Programmer/Analyst

Desired Duties and Responsibilities:

*	Perform in-depth analysis and technical support of systems and
software products
*	Identify industry and market trends, develop and execute appropriate
strategies
*	Participate in marketing studies, system conversions or proposal
development
