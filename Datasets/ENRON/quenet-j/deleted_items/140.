first, and foremost, "we" ....especially me, are not scared of anybody.
second, the real answer is that any trade beyond cal 03 needs credit
approval on a deal by deal basis.

  come on, take up the wide market issue with gautam. he's easy to "spin"
up.

    going over to the parties today?   3-6 at george brown.....5-7 at the
grasshopper........7-10 back at the george brown.....    last night there
were about 200-300  people , was a blast!
