HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001 -- You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first
race in 1905 and never looked back.
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully
behind. "The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of
its Wisconsin facilities," says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.
"The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability
around the world." H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year
they celebrate their first century of business.
	   Harley-Davidson, Incorporated is the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general
merchandise.
