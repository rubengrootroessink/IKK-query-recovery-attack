Ahhh you foolish, foolish little man.  Not only are you going against your
wife's team.... but you are going against the statistics... that the
Steelers have always won on Monday Night Football over the past 5 years....

May you crash and burn.......

   Hey,

   Don't forget to call your benefits group regarding the $$$ that you have
   placed in there.  Also don't forget to call Beta and see what the deal
   is....

   I'll be at Alex's school from 4:00 - 4:20 or so, so I'll pick you up at
   4:30.
