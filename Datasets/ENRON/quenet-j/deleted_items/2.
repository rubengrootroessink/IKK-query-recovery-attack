Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20
By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20

[IMAGE]
Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=
ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=
s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20
Analysis:  Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level i=
n seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent s=
ince May 1, 2001.  But perhaps what is most important about Constellation i=
s its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the we=
ek to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts.=
  Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold o=
ff on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply =
Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until mar=
ket conditions improve.=20
The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces.  Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the=
 California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons f=
or dropping its company-separation plans.  The company said it would now fo=
cus on using its "single" status to leverage its balance sheet to participa=
te in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United=
 States.  "What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that=
 comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year=
) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for =
new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound.  The world has chan=
ged,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a confere=
nce call with the media. =20
The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly.  The company will pa=
y Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agree=
ment, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $1=
96 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business cont=
inued.  Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will c=
ause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth qua=
rter.  The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. =
 Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when=
 the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the en=
ergy trading and marketing business.  In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take =
a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of =
Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a=
 separate trading company.  Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want =
to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain =
together.
It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans.  Mayo A. Shattuck I=
II was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001.=
  Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche B=
anc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for th=
e past seven years.  On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission sai=
d it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generatin=
g station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million.  Constella=
tion Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group.  As part of the s=
ale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at f=
ixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license o=
f Nine Mile 1 is not extended.=20
The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny.  Constellation's domest=
ic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per s=
hare of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher=
 than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share =
in earnings for the same quarter.  Allegheny Energy reported that their thi=
rd-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and t=
he acquisition of a trading and marketing unit.  Allegheny's third-quarter =
earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, =
and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share.  Allegheny is c=
onfident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3=
.80 to $4.10 per share.  =20
Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days.  The drop =
in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pri=
ces.  Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Alleghen=
y's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price=
 assumptions.  =20
The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er.  Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for =
splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations=
 can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softe=
ning wholesale market prices.  Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN A=
mro, said there are common themes affecting the industry:  "One is lower po=
wer prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower =
stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth." =20
AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees.  Its earnings fell for a second c=
onsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain an=
d said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out =
selling off assets.  AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AE=
S was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term=
 contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-ter=
m contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of f=
lat growth.  Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets we=
re very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for thei=
r product.  But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer respons=
e to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one=
 year ago in many parts of the country.  =20
The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business.  Their actions are, in some respe=
cts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabi=
lity in their power supply costs, profits and operations.  Perhaps most sig=
nificantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to=
 whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business.  As Conste=
llation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of busin=
ess is to remain an integrated company.  We would not be surprised if other=
s come to the same conclusion.  =20
