Heres your second and final reminder for the day (just in case you already
forgot)

Alex is now in Group H, his bag is in Gard 2, #242

If you pick him up between 4:00 and 4:30 he should be in the computer room.
If you get him between 3:30-4:00 he'll be in the 'Art room' which is
straight back all the way to the end (its the room right next to Gard 1,
where you would drop him of in the morning)

You be nice to him, and play with him..... NO MORE NEWS, NO MORE NEWS...
I'm gonna ask him what you guys did when I get home so you best be good...
