Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider locat=
ed in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanti=
c City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in t=
hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The =
ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding re=
imbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment.=20
Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I di=
d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on=
 what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownershi=
p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b=
ecause of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the ro=
und-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat=
es. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation'=
s nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies =
that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States. =20
The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's owne=
rship in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also h=
appen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of=
 nuclear assets is as follows:=20
A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U=
nits 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Pri=
or to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi=
ce Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of=
 the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit=
y.=20

A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un=
its 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 5=
0 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla=
nt.=20

A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U=
nits 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant a=
nd prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility.=20

As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's comp=
etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear =
sector. Let's look at Conectiv first. =20
According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of t=
he nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strateg=
y on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated =
generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the c=
ompany's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Con=
ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t=
o expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units =
that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are=
 often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant=
s and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =
factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity=
 factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the=
 value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=
erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes=
 that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=
ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=
rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they=
 are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20
The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=
eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=
iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=
ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =
$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=
-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=
ility electric generator, for $9 million. =20
Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=
ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.=
 The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=
epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=
onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =
generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=
v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=
ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=
tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=
al gas. =20
The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=
neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=
, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =
only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides e=
nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, M=
aryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's re=
gulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conec=
tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-=
alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv=
 is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such sp=
in off of its generation business would take place in the near term. Howeve=
r, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e=
xclusively on mid-merit plants. =20
Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership t=
hat is scheduled to close in April 2002.  In this deal, Pepco is acquiring =
Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both c=
ompanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a=
 later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regiona=
lly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity =
delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electri=
city delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doub=
le their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times.=20
In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N=
uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con=
ectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj=
ority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is =
a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power=
 space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li=
cense exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet =
in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind=
ustry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin =
McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built =
in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company migh=
t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility.=20
As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente=
rprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and =
electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S.=
 power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an=
d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and=
 oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power =
Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, =
PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 =
percent of Peach Bottom.=20
In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company th=
at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Enter=
gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto=
 the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=
s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=
ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=
ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=
., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=
y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the  N=
ew York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Nia=
gara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear=
 for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and=
 82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mil=
lion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently =
increased its nuclear power assets.=20
Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=
d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=
r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence.  Exelon, for example, is=
 involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucl=
ear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR).  Supporters of PBM=
R believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short constructio=
n time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power a=
n acceptable option.  In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with=
 the U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the Uni=
ted States.  Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial in=
dustry.=20
