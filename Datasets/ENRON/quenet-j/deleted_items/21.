         Hey,

         I just got an email from Linda McKula (we went to her wedding in
      Napa);
         anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be
      having
         a
         baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things
      have
         gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful
      that
         they
         still have jobs (for now).  Later.

         I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today
   from
         11-3; so
         let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.
