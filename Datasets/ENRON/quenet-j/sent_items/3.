What... no comment on the Steelers Statistics......

Anyhow, OK if you have a meeting... I'll just stay at Alex's Halloween party
for a little while longer, if you're meeting ends really early you should
walk down to his school, otherwise we'll just look for you at the normal
place...

   Ahhh you foolish, foolish little man.  Not only are you going against
   your
   wife's team.... but you are going against the statistics... that the
   Steelers have always won on Monday Night Football over the past 5
   years....

   May you crash and burn.......

      Hey,

      Don't forget to call your benefits group regarding the $$$ that you
   have
      placed in there.  Also don't forget to call Beta and see what the
   deal
      is....

      I'll be at Alex's school from 4:00 - 4:20 or so, so I'll pick you up
   at
      4:30.
