I CONTACTED BETA FINANCE, I OWE THEM ABOUT 250 OUT OF 600 BALANCE. I ALSO CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT CONTROLS OUR DAYCARE CLAIM FORMS. THEY  SAID IF WE COULD GET A STATEMENT FROM CREME SHOWING ALL THE PAYMENTS MADE IN 2001, I CAN COLLECT ALL THE MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT.      SO THEREFORE, CAN YOU ASK THE PEOPLE AT CREME IF THEY CAN PROVIDE US WITH THIS INFO ?  	

LATER.
