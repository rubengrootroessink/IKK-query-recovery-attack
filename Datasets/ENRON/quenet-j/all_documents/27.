you hurt my feelings ........................first , I'm  definetly the 
largest user of outside brokers in this entire firm........could possibly do 
more than anyone in  this market......30-40 "outside " trades each 
day.........second, in this instance he showed me a .25 bid and I hit it, 
then i offered evens( sold several hundred) then i wacked the 75's (again 
several hundred) then hit all the 50's......               when i come back 
to them and ask who I hit they say they have a problem......that it should 
have been an offer...when they listened to the tape they "think" he said 
"sell".......myself, I did nothing wrong in this.....then they come back with 
another name who will stand in at "even"....... well, make him come upto >25 
and send him the check...........I (we) assume all the risk in the broker 
market............brokers collect the commission and have no 
position........we use brokers , pay the commission and also end up with a 
bad position from "flake" trades..........

  didn't mean to vent on you .............using brokers carries 
risk(execution risk).......
