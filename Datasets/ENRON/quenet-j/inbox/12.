[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  November 13, 2001  Updates on Enron / Dynegy Mer=
ger, SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Francisco  By Will McNamara Direc=
tor, Electric Industry Analysis  [Today's column includes analysis on three=
 separate news items.]   EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge   [News item=
 from Energy Info Source] Online energy trading EnronOnline will merge with=
 smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp. agreed to =
a $9-billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. The integration of the two platforms w=
ill take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, the two wi=
ll continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegydirect, tr=
aders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.     Analysis: This=
 is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging integration of t=
he various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the merger makes s=
ense for both companies, especially considering Enron's financial instabili=
ty and its limited options at this juncture, it must be acknowledged that t=
he two companies have very different corporate cultures, and the process of=
 conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The companies hav=
e developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as illustrated by th=
eir independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be interesting to se=
e how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two sepa=
rate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegydirect  have i=
n common is that they rely on principal-based transactions.   It is importa=
nt to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed E=
nronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead of its compet=
itors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydirect about a ye=
ar later. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has r=
ecorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional value. Since its =
inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notion=
al transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnline, led by el=
ectricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and paper. EnronOnl=
ine is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in every transaction=
 that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either a buyer or a=
 seller.   Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnl=
ine became operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, alth=
ough it is growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transaction=
s in the third quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-ba=
sed. In other words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, ei=
ther as a buyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online=
, Dynegydirect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy o=
ver the telephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became=
 involved in two different kinds of online trading. The first is the propri=
etary, one-to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in =
all transactions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anon=
ymous, many-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple=
 buyers and sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had p=
reviously invested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer tha=
t created the infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates.   As a whole, th=
e online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a major growth spu=
rt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-trading exchan=
ges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by September 2001. A s=
eparate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that online tradin=
g in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 2000. The same re=
port projects that online trading volume will continue to grow, leaping fro=
m a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in 2005. Without =
question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a market edge in=
 many sectors of the energy industry, including the online trading market. =
   SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan   [News item from Energy Info So=
urce] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to delay a settlement between South=
ern California Edison (SCE) and state regulators designed to allow the util=
ity to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and to keep it from bankruptcy. U.=
S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying the deal, as requested by a cons=
umer group, would risk harming the state's second-largest utility, its cred=
itors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved the settlement on Oct. 5, cal=
led the arguments for a stay advanced by consumer group The Utility Reform =
Network (TURN) "repetitive" and "without merit."   Analysis: This is a vict=
ory for SCE in the painstaking process of establishing a rescue plan for th=
e utility with the state of California. Two weeks ago, a federal appeals co=
urt had temporarily blocked a settlement between SCE and state power regula=
tors that would keep electric rates at record highs for the next two years.=
 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN two weeks to argue agai=
nst the settlement. The settlement would help SCE, the state's second-large=
st utility, pay more than half of its estimated $6-billion debt by continui=
ng to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed last May. The judge's de=
cision now has blocked any additional counter claims by TURN, at least on t=
he current judicial level, and it appears that SCE is free to move forward =
with its CPUC-endorsed rescue plan.    It is important to note that the ori=
ginal settlement deal between SCE and the state of California emerged out o=
f negotiations that had taken place between SCE and the CPUC in an effort t=
o resolve previous litigation. SCE had sued state regulators at the CPUC af=
ter they refused to allow the utility to raise rates and recover billions o=
f dollars it had spent buying power on behalf of customers at soaring price=
s in the wholesale market. SCE's lawsuit argued that the regulators broke f=
ederal law and unconstitutionally took its property by not letting it bill =
customers for the full cost of their electricity. At the present time, SCE'=
s total debt is marked at about $6.35 billion in power procurement-related =
liabilities due to state law that prohibited it from recovering the high co=
sts of wholesale electricity through retail electric rates. Under the agree=
ment reached between SCE and the CPUC, SCE would be allowed to pay down abo=
ut $3 billion of its back debt of $6.35 billion.   In exchange for being pr=
otected from bankruptcy proceedings, SCE agreed to a rate freeze and a prom=
ise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt=
 is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximately 42 percent in 2001 a=
nd will remain frozen through 2003 unless the utility pays off its debts so=
oner. In exchange, SCE agreed it would use cash on hand and any revenue bey=
ond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts; pay=
 no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or until its back debts are =
fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC h=
ad violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the und=
erlying cost of wholesale power. From its perspective, officials at Edison =
International (the parent company of SCE) expressed confidence that the set=
tlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate enough cash and gain fin=
ancing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of 2002 to pay its debt to=
 banks, bondholders and power generators.    Tally of Absentee Ballots Chan=
ges San Francisco Municipalization Vote   [News item from Reuters] Two ball=
ot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in San Francisco an=
d unplugging utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have gone down in defeat, o=
fficials said on Nov. 12.   Analysis: The tally of absentee ballots in the =
Nov. 6 municipalization vote in San Francisco changed at least part of the =
outcome in this election. As noted in a previous IssueAlert, Proposition I,=
 which sought to set up a Municipal Utility District in San Francisco and n=
eighboring Brisbane, was defeated. However, originally it was believed that=
 the separate measure known as Proposition F, which would have established =
a Municipal Water and Power Agency in San Francisco alone, had passed by a =
slim margin. Upon counting the absentee ballots, the San Francisco Departme=
nt of Elections announced that this measure was defeated by a scant 533 vot=
es.     Obviously, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is quite pleased with the rev=
ised outcome of this election. In response to the finalized vote, represent=
atives from the utility said, "This outcome affirms that there is no strong=
 sentiment in favor of the takeover of PG&E's distribution system in San Fr=
ancisco." There may be some validity to this statement, considering that on=
e could argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric and the re=
cent California energy crisis, conditions could have favored a pro-municipa=
lization vote, and yet the measure still failed. However, let's not forget =
that it was defeated by only 533 votes, which indicates that the issue rega=
rding the establishment of a public power system in the area is far from ov=
er.    The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be att=
ributed to several factors. First, it must be acknowledged that PG?Corp., t=
he parent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, spent about $1 millio=
n on advertising to defeat the measure. However, arguably voters responded =
to claims by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. that the municipalization plan was =
unrealistic. The utility claimed that a (MUD) Municipal Utility would be il=
l-equipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Ga=
s & Electric has managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would n=
ot be able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new =
MUD would have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and=
 also buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which=
 represent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the=
 long run.    An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available =
