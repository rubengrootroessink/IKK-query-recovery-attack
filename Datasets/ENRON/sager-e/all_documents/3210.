Elizabeth:

I agree that it's probably better not to attend the conference.  After our 
conversation I, too, concluded that it would be awkward---just too much 
explaining to do!

I had a great time at Whistler and in Vancouver, but I'm glad to be back.  
This week is going to be exciting.

Mark H. gave me a call re offices on Friday.  I will try to follow up with 
him today.

I hope all is well with you.

Best,

Steve
