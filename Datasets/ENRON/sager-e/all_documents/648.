Elizabeth -

I had a conversation with Carol yesterday about her new responsibilities 
helping the trading desk.  She mentioned that it was still up in the air as 
to her exact responsibilities and mentioned a staff meeting tomorrow.  I was 
hoping you could clarify for me (and I am sure everyone in Portland) if she 
will be dedicated to the West or also be working on East projects.
