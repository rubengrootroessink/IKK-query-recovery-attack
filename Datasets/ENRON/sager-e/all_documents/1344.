Subject: Per your request


Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe 
that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.  
The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and 
greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the 
cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been 
numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this 
email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest 
and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.

Stuart
