Janet, sorry I was unable to return your call today, but I was tied up most
of the day in meetings, one of which was with Powerex.  Though it dealt with
other matters I did have a chance to briefly discuss this matter with
Powerex and I am advised that the issue of the credit annex may be or become
academic.  The original $340,000,000 has been reduced to $240,000,000 and is
to be further reduced as a result of pricing changes.  In addition, Enron is
apparently providing a new or increased letter of credit, which will be
sufficient to cover the reduced liability.  As a result it is expected that
the necessity for the cash deposit will disappear next week, perhaps as
early as Tuesday.  If this proves to be the case, the credit annex will not
be required, thereby making life easier for both of us.  If the foregoing
result does not occur as early in the week as contemplated or if it becomes
necessary for your cash management purposes, Powerex has no objection to
signing a letter extending the interim letter agreement for, say, another 2
weeks (if it becomes apparent that the cash deposit will still be required
after that time we will have to revisit the drafting of the credit annex).
