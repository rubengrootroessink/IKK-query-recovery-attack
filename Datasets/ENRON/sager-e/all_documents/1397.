     For our New York workshop, I would like to put some "meat" on my very
intellectual (HaHa) discussion of the Cover Sheet.  Specifically, I would
like to go through some examples of how the Cover Sheet can be filled out,
i.e., focus on some credit hypotheticals and provide examples of the type
of things that you can add to the Cover Sheet, i.e., arbitration, choice of
venue, waiver of jury trial, language regarding transactions performed in
the WSPP or ERCOT control areas, etc.

     If you have already drafted any provisions to add to the Cover Sheet
or have any ideas for hypotheticals, I'd appreciate your input.  If you are
planning on adding standard provisions to all your EEI Cover Sheets, this
would be an excellent opportunity to allow me to "market" them for you and
explain their need/purpose/applicability.

     Also, I don't suppose anyone has come up with a Gas Schedule to the
EEI Agreement???  Just an idea which I'm not opposed to and which would
lead us in the direction Mark and Chris seemed to be pointing, i.e., a
Master Physical Agreement applicable to numerous types commodities.
Considering GISB is intending to revise its current form for short term
transactions and create a new form for long term transactions, this would
be an excellent opportunity to allow GISB and EEI to work with (and not
against) each other.

     If you, or your company, is not currently on the drafting committee
for GISB's proposed revisions and creation of a new form for long term
transactions (which, by the way, is an important point I want to make to
the GISB group that we do not want two separate forms, one for short and
one for long in the first place), I encourage you to contact GISB @
GISB1@aol.com and get involved.

     Please let me know your thoughts.

     Thanks.
