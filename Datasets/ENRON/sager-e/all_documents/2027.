Nils,

We have kept our heat rates constant but changed the MW capacity in the 
summer and shoulders.  This shouldn't affect the $/kw-mo bid or offer so 
nothing has really changed except for the MW.  In answer to your question on 
the turbines.  They were 7B combustion turbines but have been upgraded, 
refurbished and all over rebuilt into a GE 7E equivalent.  I have attached 
your previous proposal with the new capacity schedules for your review.  
Let's revisit our numbers today and see where we stand on the bid/offer 
spread.    Also, if you could send over that tolling language for our review 
as soon as you are finished with it, I would appreciate it.  Thank you for 
working on that all day yesterday.  I will call you later today.

-Joe
