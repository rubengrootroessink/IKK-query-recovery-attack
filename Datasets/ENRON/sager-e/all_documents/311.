We are fine with Nolan's changes.

Please note one additional change: Exhibit B, Item 1, the "Confirmation
Number" should be corrected to read 403862.

To complete this transaction, the following needs to happen:

1.Enron needs to sign off on our's and Avista's changes and add the correct
references in the second to last "WHEREAS".

2.Enron and PGET (Dan Sarti) need to finalize the Enron payment amount under
Section 7.

3.PGET (Dan Sarti) needs to provide our wiring instructions for Section 7.

4.Avista needs to provide its wiring instructions for Section 8.

I will be checking voice mails and, later this afternoon, will check
e-mails, should you have any questions.

We have received a copy of PG&E's comments.  For the most part, we accept
the language.  Only two small modifications:

Change #1: Page 2....second full paragraph.  Replace the word "refund" with
"return."

Change #2: Page 6...last paragraph.  After PGET's wording (which is okay
with us), insert the following: "The return of AVISTA Collateral by PGET to
AVISTA shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to the consent of AVISTA
herein."


Other than that....we're okay with all other language.  I'd be interested in
seeing Enron's comments to PGET's version, as well as this revised version
by Avista.

Attached are my preliminary comments on legal matters.  While I have
attempted to reflect the business deal as I know it, I have not had an
opportunity to consult fully with my client, so I reserve our rights to make
further changes.
