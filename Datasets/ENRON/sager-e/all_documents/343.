Per my voice mail, in addition to other changes we are discussing, I would
like to modify PG&E Affiliate and Enron Afiliate to mean affiliates who are
party to an Underlying Master Agreement, and expressly recognize that PG&E
Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation is not a PG&E Affiliate.  These
additions are shown blacklined in the first attachment to this e-mail. Also,
add to signature block of the Netting Agreement and to the coverage of the
Guarantee our affiliate CEG Energy Options Inc.   Thanks, Peter
