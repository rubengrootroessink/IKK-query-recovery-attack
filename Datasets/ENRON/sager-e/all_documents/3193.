This is still very much a work in progress, but this is where things stand 
tonight.  The Atlantic City Electric EEI Master was executed this afternoon 
(and the Enron Corp. guarantee is completely negotiated, too) so that we can 
actually get all signed up w/ a confirm if we win the 300MW bid on Friday, so 
it's no longer on the list.
Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of this.  I'm planning to leave all 
the files in my office when I go, and to update the power contracts database 
w/ comments about outstanding issues as one of the last things I do next week 
before I go.
Regards,
Janice
