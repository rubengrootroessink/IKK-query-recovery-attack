Liz,

Please disregard the following message.  I did get your voicemail. The AMA 
that we are doing started with basically this form and has been pretty 
watered down as to the decision process we must follow.  Thanks for your help.

Liz,

For some reason I didn't get your voicemail.  I'll stop by this afternoon to 
double check that you are OK with the EPMI entity in the role of  Asset 
Manager/Marketing  Agent in the North Carolina Power Holdings transaction 
that we are structuring with AIG/Highstar.

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  


Kay
