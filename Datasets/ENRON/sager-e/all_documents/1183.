Dear Liz,

Hello from Rice.  Just thought I'd drop an email to see it works.  The
above address is my email here at Rice on sabbatical.  If you mail
to wsager@ocean.tamu.edu, that's my address at TAMU.  I recommend
the TAMU address because I have those messages copied here,
so I will get them no matter where I am.  But I sometimes don't see
the Rice messages if they come while I am back home.

So last I heard, I thought you were working as an attorney in a private
practice.  But now you must be working for Enron.  Seems like
everybody in Houston is working in the awl bidness these days.  I hosted
a career discussion group for our grad students last week and invited
TAMU alums to come talk about careers in oceanography.  All were
driven by the offshore energy industry in some way (either energy
companies, service companies, or regulatory agencies), except for
one guy from the Navy.  And they all said "don't plan to keep the same
job for more than ~10 years."

Nice to see you at the wedding.  We'll have to plan to get together some
time.

Bye,
Will
