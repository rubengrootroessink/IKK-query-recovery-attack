We met, but did not do anything more.  I'll send you an email from Oscar 
about some proposed language.  Ask Elizabeth how to proceed and we'll help as 
needed.  Thanks!

Could you let me know what happened with this? I was out of town when the 
meeting was to occur. Is action needed? --David

I just talked with Elizabeth Sager about this and we are scheduling a meeting 
this week.  I'll include Jeff and David too.

Christi,

We need to meet with David Portz to discuss the risk associated with 
transmission changes as a result of new RTO's.  This morning in Bauhgman's 
meeting I volunteered to work with you and David to prepare draft contract 
language on this issue.

Let me know when you can meet.

Thanks - Jeff
