Clement,

Can you please tell me the status of this?  Elizabeth said it needed to be 
sent to the Counterparty this week.

Thanks,
Genia

Clement,

Attached please find the above referenced Agreement in favor the Tennessee 
Valley Authority for further handling by you.  This isn't the standard Enron 
Corp. form, however, I believe you have already approved it.  Please let me 
know when this has been executed and I will pick it up.  

Thanks for your help,
Genia
