Attached is a draft of the reply brief.  I will continue to edit and
tighten it up, but I wanted to get it to you in ordre to give you some,
albiet limited, time to review.  We need to have it filed by 5:00pm EST
tomorrow, and need to have it on the fax to Jane Parver by 4:00 pm EST.
Pullman & Comley in Conn. will need some time to convert it to their
system, so if there is any way you could try to get  comments to me by noon
tomorrow, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I think we have a shot and feel much better about our chances than I did
upon initially reviewing the Trustee's brief.  Although well written, the
Trustee truly mischaracterizes a number of cases and loses a lot of
credibility.

Thanks.
