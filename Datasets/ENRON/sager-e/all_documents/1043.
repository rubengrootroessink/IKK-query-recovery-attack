Due to the flooding this weekend in the Houston area, several Enron 
Information Technology systems lost power. As a result, we are currently in 
the process of restoring data to user and common data directories (h:\ drive 
and m:\ drive).  You are receiving this message because you have data on one 
of these directories that is being restored.

You may be missing data or see old data on your h:\ or m:\ drives. If you 
have created or modified files from these directories on Friday or today, it 
is important that you save the file with a different name, otherwise, you run 
the chance of your files being overwritten by the restore.

If you have any questions regarding this restore process, please call your 
respective Help Desk.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
