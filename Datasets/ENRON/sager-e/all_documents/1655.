Here's the final draft that was sent out today.  Still waiting for credit 
terms to be worked out, as far as I know at the moment.  Thanks very much for 
your help today.  Made me feel better about this going out there for possible 
execution.  And even if this deal doesn't go, we all learned a lot about 
doing unit entitlement purchases -- which will come in handy if the National 
Grid deal goes through.  That RFP response was sent in w/ indicative 
pricing/terms, rather than a binding bid. 
Got your voicemail about JEA.  I brought all that stuff w/ me and planned to 
read it on the plane.  I'm sorry that I misunderstood  -- didn't realize that 
you needed the followup today.    
Regards,
Janice
