Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya
