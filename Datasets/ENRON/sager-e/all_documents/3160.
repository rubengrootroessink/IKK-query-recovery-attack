Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align 
the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product.
 
The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to 
ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm 
transmission is scheduled. 
 
If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise 
to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this 
stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the 
GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL 
in line with EEI.
 
When you are back lets meet to discuss how  best to take this forward.
 
As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to 
deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not 
something that we can achieve "click" approvals of just yet, however the 
changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part 
of the "click" and accept concept on EOL.  I will be giving this further 
thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to 
go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.

 As a preliminary point, is it your understanding that, provided we display 
the  attribution to the copyright owners on the Website, we will not need to 
obtain any further licenses? This is not clear on the face of the document 
which does not envisage that the document will be displayed as part of a 
website's terms and conditions, capable of acceptance. Is there a licence I 
could have a look at, for example? I am concerned that the digital rights may 
still be retained by the copyright owners, however having regard to the 
tremendous exposure and endorsement the document would receive by being used 
on EOL, I would hope that any licenses, if required, could be concluded 
quickly and at no cost to EOL.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus
