Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering 
holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power 
contract developed through EEI.  You will note that EEI listed you as a 
potential speaker.  EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this 
presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.  

Thanks

Subject: Conference on Standardized Contract



As part of our outreach process for the standardized contract, EEI is 
planning to offer a conference for the industry and regulators on November 
17, 1999 in Washington, D.C.  We would like to invite you to participate in 
the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master 
Agreement.  I've attached a proposed program for the conference would 
appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral 
presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.

Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let 
me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have 
someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group, 
it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on 
the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were 
thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit 
ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If 
need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of 
the presenters for the program.
