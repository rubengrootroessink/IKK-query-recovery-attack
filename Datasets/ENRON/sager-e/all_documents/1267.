I have been asked by numerous parties to put together a rough outline for 
items which require consideration in connection with Unit Contingent PPA's 
(as opposed to the typical commodity form of PPA).  Attached is a quick cut 
that I threw together.  Please take a look and provide me with any 
coments/suggestions that you might have to enhance this document.  Thanks in 
advance for your time and effort.

Stuart
