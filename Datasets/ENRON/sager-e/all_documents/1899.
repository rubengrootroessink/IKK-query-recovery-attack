Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit
Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by
Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the
other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making
comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst
the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe
even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

Subject:  Meeting on December 14


Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be
interested in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit
annex draft.  Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading
documentation at a law firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him
afterwards?  Let me know asap and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at
the firm, if we can meet after the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on
Bill's availability too.
