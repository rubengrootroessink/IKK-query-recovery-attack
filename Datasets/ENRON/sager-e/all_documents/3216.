Doug and Ed,

Based upon the additional information you have provided to me, I have revised 
our draft of EPMI's damages calculation.  Please review it ASAP, as I would 
like to be able to send it to our outside counsel this afternoon.  Also, 
there are a couple of blanks/question marks:  Doug, you indicated that you 
thought you could calculate our sales price per MWH for sales to LCRA during 
the months of June-September 2000 by getting an index price from your 
analyst.  Also, are we quoting natural gas prices in mcf or mmbtu?  Please 
call with your comments.  Thanks.
