Are we still on for lunch Wed.?
(1) The PSEG tolling agreement is super high priority right now, b/c of mkt 
volatility, so I'm marking up the Black Hills deal (lots of it is not 
relevant or helpful b/c there are dispatch blocks in the PSEG deal, which 
need to be addressed somehow) and will speak to you tomorrow, I hope , after 
meeting w/ the commercial guys again.
(2) New deal from Woody -- Wisvest is trying to unload the SOS load they have 
for Connecticut Light & Power -- wholesale contract, about 11% of the CT SOS 
load and Dana is interested in doing this one.  Wisvest wants an MOU by next 
week.  Just got the CA this evening and am working on it so we can get the 
info needed for evaluation.
(3) TEPAC is still pretty hot, b/c TVA's short power, so this would be a good 
time to have a deal w/ them.  I still need to meet w/ everybody and go over 
the remaining risks on that one
(4) Reliant - Dave Fairley wants to do a 50 MW deal w/ them in FL just like 
the one we did w/ Reedy Creek, w/ a few wrinkles I haven't fully learned 
about yet, except that they own 2 units and about 50 MW from another unit; 
he's not sure who the interconnects are with; Reliant has no native load, of 
course, so the FM issues will be different.  Another one that has to close 
very soon b/c the price is only $26.
(5) E Trans is at it again, but all they need at the moment is a couple more 
confidentiality agreements so they can start talking to some new players.  
Apparently, the National Grid is interested in operating an RTO and PJM is 
forming its own jv to provide services to RTOs and they all want us to have 
some kind of role -- getting interesting again.
Will keep you posted.
Regards,
Janice
