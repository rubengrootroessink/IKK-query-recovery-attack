This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.
Bill

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft
form of proposed margin agreement.  The threshold amounts can be changed
based on our discussions. While I would prefer to use an EEI agreement,
unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Thanks
