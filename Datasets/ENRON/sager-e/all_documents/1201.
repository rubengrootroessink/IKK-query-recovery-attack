Subject: Typo



Hi Everyone:

    It was brought to my attention by more than one eagle-eye that there was
a typo in section 13.1 of the Enabling Agreement.  The PUCT substantive rule
was 25 not 26.  Attached is the corrected document.  The admin office has
this corrected version as well.

    Sorry for any problems.
