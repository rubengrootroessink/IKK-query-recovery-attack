I could meet you guys at the zoo and could help in trying to manage the
kids.  If it's ok, I'll meet you at the front gate.  Sheryl mentioned Sam's
sick.  How's he doin?

Hi Phil
Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000
with the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are
invited with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more
leisurely morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them
home. If we were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.  Let me
know what you would like.  thanks
