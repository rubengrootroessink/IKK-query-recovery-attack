Participants: 

Last Friday, January 26th, the Special and Correcting  Invoices for the 
Southern 
California Edison  (SCE) default were due and there were some Participants 
who 
failed to comply with Schedule 2. Section 4.3.2. of the PX  Tariff which 
states, 
"All payments by  the PX Participants shall be made to the PX Clearing 
Account 
via the Fedwire System for funds to be received at the PX  Clearing Account 
no 
later than noon PPT on  the Payment Due Date." 

Additionally, Schedule 2, Section 5.5 of the PX  Tariff requires the PX to 
identify such  Participants to all other affected PX Participants by the most 
expeditious means available.? In accordance with Section  5.5, here is a list 
of 
PX Participants not in  compliance with Section 4.3.2. for the SCE default: 

?? American Electric Power Service  Corporation 
?? Arizona Public  Service 
?? Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power 
?? Pacific Gas  & Electric 
?? Sacramento  Municipal Utility District 
?? Salt  River Project 

Each PX Participant's pro-rata portion of the  shortfall from the 
Participants 
mentioned  above will be communicated to them individually in the next couple 
of  
days.? If you should have questions, please  call Clark Cheng at 626-537-3243 
or 
Chris  Anderson at 626-537-3377. 

Thank You.
