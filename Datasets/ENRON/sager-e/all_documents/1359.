We were very pleased to see the enthusiasm surrounding the opening of Enron 
Field yesterday as tickets to the first four games at the ballpark went on 
sale to employees.  Unfortunately, Enron was only able to obtain a very 
limited number of tickets from the Astros to these games, and as expected, 
tickets sold out very quickly.  Therefore, no tickets are available for sale 
going forward.

We appreciate the feedback, both positive and negative, that some of you have 
shared regarding the opportunity provided employees to purchase tickets and 
the process by which the tickets were sold.  We recognize that no method for 
selling such a limited supply of tickets would be without room for 
improvement.  The process was devised to  allow the majority of employees a 
fair and reasonable opportunity to secure tickets through Enron for one of 
these first four games.  While careful consideration was given to 
establishing a lottery system, direct sales were selected because of the 
magnitude of logistical issues surrounding a lottery of this scale and scope.
 
We established the 11am - 1pm time frame so that most employees could 
purchase tickets over their lunch hour, rather than during business hours.  
Much to our dismay, some employees began forming lines as early as 9:00am.  
By 10:00am, the crowd was so large that it presented a safety hazard within 
the building.  We began issuing flyers for tickets at 10:30am and selling 
tickets at 10:45am at my direction to eliminate any safety concerns.

Considering the demand for these tickets throughout the City of Houston and 
Southeast Texas, it is truly a benefit that Enron employees were provided a 
special opportunity  to purchase these tickets.  We regret that Enron does 
not have a larger number of tickets for these games to offer employees and 
that so many were disappointed.  We hope to be able to give away tickets to 
some of these games through special promotions, as well as provide 
opportunities to purchase tickets to other games throughout the inaugural 
season at Enron Field.
  
Tickets for all 84 home games are available through Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone can call (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also accessible on-line 
at www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

Thanks again for your enthusiasm surrounding Enron Field.
