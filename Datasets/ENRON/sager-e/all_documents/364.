Subject: California sues PG&E over its reorganization

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving 
PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is 
attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering 
if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the 
event of a bankruptcy.
