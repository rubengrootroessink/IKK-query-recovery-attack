Attached is my forthcoming article on managing risk in the documentation
process. It is appearing in the London-based journal "MiddleOffice,"
published by the FOW group. Some of you have seen an earlier version of
this.

You may want to consider whether certain issues or solutions discussed here
would be applicable to Enron.

If there are questions or comments, please feel free to contact me by e-mail
or at 212.966.7672.
