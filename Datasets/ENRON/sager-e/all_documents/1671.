Elizabeth:

Per your request, attached is the latest draft of the DeAcero PPA.

As I indicated to you on the telephone, it is Max Yzaguirre's intent to 
forward this document to DeAcero this afternoon as the final form of the 
document.

Please call with questions or comments.

Peggy:

Here's a copy of the DeAcero PPA.  Drew said that he'd speak with Edith Cross 
and address her concerns.


Thanks - Max
