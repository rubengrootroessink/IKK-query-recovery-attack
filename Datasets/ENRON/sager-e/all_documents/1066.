So great is the humor about all this WSPP stuff and the tennis backdrop that 
I would be willing to "come out of retirement" and enter the doubles combat 
zone.  The thought of Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman, former Bible School 
doubles player from Kansas, striding on to the court to do battle with that 
little runt of a MIke Small,  this fuels my competitive imagination to the 
point of red hot coals.    I need to go see my cousin in Boulder and could 
work something in around this event. If there is room for me to go to the 
WSPP meeting, not the full camp thing, and you don't mind,  consider me in.

done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the 
Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 
and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to 
Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

Don't forget to book the court at the same time as the room! ----cgy
