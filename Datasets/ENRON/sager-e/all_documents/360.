Woody has asked that we do whatever is needed to put good paper in place with 
the following counterparties so that his deal flow in NE can be done a bit 
more smoothly.
New Brunswick Power
Green Mountain Power
Central Vermont PUblic Service Company
Northeast Utilities (agent for CP&L, Western Mass, etc.)
Bangor Hydroelectric Company

As you know, I've already gotten some of the wheels rolling on these 
counterparties, but the work isn't finished yet on any of them.  And Green 
Mountain just filed a new tariff.  Is this something that I could ask Marcus 
to work on with me?  (I understand from Genia that he's now in our group and 
is looking for work.)  Thanks.

Regards,
Janice
