Hi Harlan

Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't 
seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd 
love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into 
meeting.  I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed 
that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with 
afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.  He would propose that he, 
Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work 
for you.

Happy trails
Elizabeth
