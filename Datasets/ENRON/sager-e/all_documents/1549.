Members of the working group for MISO

Attached are a set of files that many of you may have seen that are the
result of work undertaken to define the attributes of a real flow system for
SPP.  Because, at yesterday's meeting, several of you indicated that you had
not seen these I am including the full deck here.

The work reported in these documents was sponsored by:

Coral
Dynegy
Enron
PG&E Gen
Tanaska.

In addition to the FAQ attached we responded to about 40 other questions
that were posed by participants in SPP. These came in several waves and
tended to be far more specific to SPP and therefore are not attached.  I can
pull those together if you believe that they would be helpful.

My plan is to be at the meeting in Chicago next monday and I can answer
questions (off line so that I don't take committee time) about these
documents if that would be useful for individuals.

BEST

Richard D. Tabors
