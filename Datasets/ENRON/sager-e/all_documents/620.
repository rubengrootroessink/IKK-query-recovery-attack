I'm not surprised, altho for a while, it wasn't a very high priority with 
anyone here.  I've put my file on your chair.  No outside counsel has been 
involved to date.

Janice:
Thanks.  Bill was anxious to pursue the Reliant surety bond issue.  Do you 
have a file on this?  Did you consult with outside counsel and if so, who?
