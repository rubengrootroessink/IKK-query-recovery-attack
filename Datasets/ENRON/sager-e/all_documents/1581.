I discovered Thursday afternoon that ACES Power Marketing is entering into 
power transactions on behalf of Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.  Our CP 
in En-Power is Wabash, and so far as documentation/global counterparties, all 
transactions are entered into directly by Wabash.  However, it is actually 
ACES that is making the call or using the EOL password to do a deal.  

I have requested a copy of the agency agreement between Aces and Wabash and 
have forwarded to Wabash the attached form of Consent and Acknowledgment for 
execution.

I would like to discuss with you whether you feel further steps are necessary 
with regard to either our general contractual relationship or EnronOnline and 
have set up a meeting through Brenda.

Leslie
