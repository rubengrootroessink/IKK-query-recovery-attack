Please revise Part 1(a)(2) of the Other Changes section of the EEI Cover=20

=20
Delivery Point" from the second line, (ii) delete the phrase "at Seller=01,=
s=20
option" from the fifth line and replace it with the following: =01&absent a=

sale=018, and (iii) insert after the phrase =01&commercially reasonable man=
ner=018 in=20
the sixth line, the following phrase =01&; provided, however if the Seller =
is=20
unable after using commercially reasonable efforts to resell all or a porti=
on=20
of the Product not received by Buyer, the Sales Price with respect to such=
=20
Product shall be deemed equal to zero (0)".

Note that the only change is the substitution of "not received" for "not=20
delivered" in the last line above.

EEI Masters reflect any updates.
