Susan was even kind enough to point out that Ms. Sager will be turning
another year older real soon...

Do we still have friends?  Amazing.  James is in Europe but we both hope to
be home that weekend.  But isn't it Liz's birthday?  Our birthdays are over
and we really don't want a birthday party.  It would be great to get
together if I am not locked in an insane asylum.

some of your forgetful friends would like to celebrate your birthdays on
Saturday, July 1...is that a good day for both of you?
