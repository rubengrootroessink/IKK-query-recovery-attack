Hey.

Hear that you didn't get to hit with Dan on Monday but instead got a few 
games of doubles under your belt.  How did that go?

I was wondering if you wanted to hit on Thursday either during lunch or after 
work.  I usually have a meeting during lunch on Thursday but heard it might 
be cancelled.  I am going to be up at the Met this evening and will book a 
court if you want to hit during either times.  I will just have to get back 
with you if you want to hit during lunch to let you know if we have our 
meeting or not.

Talk to you soon.

Char
