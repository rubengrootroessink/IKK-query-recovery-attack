I just received the package of master agreements you asked Genia to send me.
Thank you so much.  I have some thoughts about an approach to a simple master
and will look through these documents over the next weeks to see if I think 
the
approach will work.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.  I am asking my
secretary to send you a copy of the recent supplement to Documentation for
Derivatives on cross-product risk management that Tony and I just published, 
in
case it is of interest.
