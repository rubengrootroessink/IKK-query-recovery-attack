Wendy:


Bill may have already asked, but can we get the balances for the ISO/PX 
amounts we are showing?  PG&E has asked for the balances and the application 
of partial payments to reconcile against their records and the ISO/PX records 
which they have requested through the Bankruptcy court.    We need to review 
this with Lisa Mellencamp & Liz Sager prior to sending.


Thanks,


Michael
