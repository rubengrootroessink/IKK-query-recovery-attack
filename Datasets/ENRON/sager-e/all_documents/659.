Carol,
From our discussion today it is obvious that we who are toiling with West 
Desk legal coverage are all going to get a big boost from your involvement.  
I will send a draft e'mail message to you and Elizabeth setting forth how I 
think we should best explain our EEI teamwork dynamics to the traders.

Christian:
Elizabeth has suggested that I assist you with the "West" work, particularly 
negotiating EEI's.  Can we set up a time to talk about what work is out there 
and how I can assist?  Suzanne Adams (37340) is my assistant and has my 
schedule.  Thanks.
