Attached please find (in clean and blackline form) a revised draft of the
request for rehearing based upon yesterday's discussion and the comments we 
have
received.  More work needs to be done to integrate the revised Pifer Affidavit
(a copy of which is also attached for those who may not have received it).  We
hope to circulate the "business person's" affidavit later today.

We look forward to your comments.
