Duke Energy Releases Average Prices Charged for Electricity in California
Average Price of $76 Per Megawatt-Hour for 2000, $136 for First Quarter 2001
CHARLOTTE, N.C., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK - news) today 
released average prices the company charged over the last 15 months for 
wholesale electricity in California. The average prices of $76 per megawatt- 
hour charged in 2000 and $136 per megawatt-hour in first quarter 2001 are 
well below average spot market prices for the same periods.

``Clearly by selling the vast majority of our electricity into the forward 
markets through long-term contracts we have demonstrated that low average 
prices can be achieved for California's consumers,'' said Jim Donnell, 
president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy North America.

``The way for California to stabilize prices is to enter into long-term 
contracts at fixed prices. We continue to work with the California Department 
of Water Resources to negotiate long-term contracts to help the state avoid 
purchasing power on the volatile spot market. Just last July, we offered to 
sell 2,000 megawatts to the state at a fixed price of $50 per megawatt-hour 
for five years. The state did not act upon our offer,'' Donnell said.

Duke also reported that the highest price charged during first quarter 2001 
was $3,880 per megawatt-hour. That price was for less than 1/10 of 1 percent 
of the volume sold to California by the company in first quarter 2001 and 
reflected the significant credit risks associated with selling power through 
the California Independent System Operator (ISO) to Pacific Gas & Electric 
(NYSE: PCG - news; PG&E) and Southern California Edison (Amex: SCEQ - news) 
at that time.

``The few sales made at the highest price reflected the fact that the parties 
receiving the power were insolvent and would likely declare bankruptcy. In 
determining the price to charge, we took into account the likelihood that we 
would only be able to collect a fraction of the sales price if PG&E filed for 
bankruptcy protection. Obviously our concerns were valid because on April 6 
PG&E did file for bankruptcy protection and we still have not been paid,'' 
Donnell said.

``On March 26 we said that if we are paid we will not seek to collect the 
portion of the price charged for the poor credit risk,'' Donnell added.

Donnell emphasized Duke Energy's commitment to California -- citing the 
company's announcement in 1998 of its intention to add additional generation 
in California. Duke has currently under construction a 1,060-megawatt plant 
and eventually could add as much as 1,500 additional megawatts. He also said 
Duke Energy's California power plants generated 50 percent more electricity 
in 2000, providing 15.8 million megawatt-hours versus 9.5 million in 1999.

Duke Energy supplies just over 5 percent of California's electricity from 
four power plants in the state with a capacity of 3,351 megawatts -- enough 
energy to serve about 3.4 million households.
