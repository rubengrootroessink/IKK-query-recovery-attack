Paul Pantano has sent me a newly released proposal by the Commodities Future 
Trading Commission on how it will streamline regulating various markets.  It 
has made a distinction for electricity trading based on its characterization 
of it having an "inexhaustible supply". Based on this distinction its 
oversight over electricity trading will be less comprehensive than other 
commodities.  I am sure Paul would be willing to answer further questions you 
may have.
