As discussed at the 1/26 Working Group meeting, I am circulating minutes of 
the meeting we had with the FERC staff regarding tariff/filing/reporting  
issues related to the Master Contract.  In sum, the meeting was very 
successful in that the staff does not expect their requirements to impose a 
burden on the utilization of the Standard Contract.  If you have further 
questions, please feel free to contact me.
