Hi

Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, 
after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I 
thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my 
first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over 
Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out 
came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody 
stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a 
mess.  I think I better work on that shot.

Tennis on Wed.? 

Elizabeth
