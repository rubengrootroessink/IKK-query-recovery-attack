Elizabeth,

Well, I think I can safely say my biggest accomplishment this year was in my 
personal life however, I guess that will have to be "graded" by a higher 
being!!!!

1.  Understanding and implementing the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Fine tuning where necessary and adjusting per Counterparty.

2.  Supporting a larger staff of attorneys than previously, keeping the paper 
flow moving for all, assisting with special projects as needed and insuring a 
sense of urgency when warranted.

3.  Understanding the different personalities in the Group, acting as liason 
within the Group and promoting a team effort to help the overall success of 
the Power Trading Group.

4.  Performing my duties in a cheerful, helpful manner always remembering to 
be respectful of others and a good listener.

Genia
