Melissa -- The redlined confirmation below shows the language resolved after 
discussion with Dana as to what is being traded by the market participants. 
Going forward, the insert is to be placed in confirmations with a NEPOOL PTF 
Delivery Point where delivery will occur at or after 1/1/03, including 
confirmations issued in relation to EOL trading.   Please call me with any 
questions.  Thanks. --David

Dana -- Attached is a draft confirmation template with text inserted in the 
Delivery Point section to treat the multi-settlement issue you identified.  
Dan Alleghretti worked with me to put this together, and believes that 
multi-settlement would not be implemented before 1/1/03.  The text is 
intended to balance Buyer's and Seller's intersests so that it can be placed 
in confirmations where EPMI is Buyer or Seller.  Please come back to me your 
comments or I will stop by your desk with a hard copy later this morning so 
that we can discuss.  --David

David,

Can you handle?  This first went to Janice but nothing was done before she 
left, then I re-assigned to Marcus yesterday and we know where he is!!

Thanks,
Genia

I will take a look at this. Melissa have you any other details you can pass 
on to me before I speak with Dana which may be helpful.

Melissa,

Sorry about that, I assumed Janice was taking care of it while we were at the 
legal conference and she did not tell me otherwise.  By copy of this to 
Marcus, he can let me know if he can look at it or if I should re-assign.  

Sorry for the delay,
Genia

Hello, is Marcus doing this?  Janice never responded last week.

Thanks,
Melissa

Marcus,

Will you be looking at this or shall I assign to someone else?

Thanks,

Hello, Dana Davis (Vice President of trading) just informed me of some new 
language that needs to be added to our confirmation letters for deals done at 
NEPOOL PTF (this is the delivery point).  The language he gave me is as 
follows:

In the event that multi settlement is implemented then NEPOOL PTF becomes 
seller's choice. (I am sure this needs to be worded differently)

I told Dana that I would have to run this language through one of the 
attorneys.  He said they could call him and he would explain further.

He also wants this language added to the NEPOOL PTF product on Enron Online 
(this would not be for NEPOOL ICAP deals, installed capacity).

I copied Marcus on this e-mail but I am not certain if he would be the 
correct person to work on this or not.  Dana would like to start adding this 
language as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Melissa
