As predicted Consumers have started the arbitration process. Andy Edison has 
been kept up to speed with all of this by me so between him and Dynegy we 
should be in good shape to progress.
 
If you need any other information please ask, otherwise I will keep you 
informed as this matter progresses, both from an arbitration stand-point and 
any attempts to commercially settle this dispute.
