I wonder if Section 2.7 may need to go into the SD Warren K in some 
fashion...  I will discuss this with you tomorrow.

Here's the draft I was telling you about earlier today.  The CMS is addressed 
in sec. 2.7 I think.  The New Market Products concept was aimed at makeing 
sure that Enron wouldn't have responsibility for any ancillary services 
"invented" after the deal was signed, unless, of course, we had new 
negotiations w/ new price, etc.
Regards,
Janice
