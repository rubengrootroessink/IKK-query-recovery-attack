I do not remember any discussions on indemnification.  As to the exclusion
of direct damages, we did discuss that concept.  The intent was that the
21.3 damage calculation would recoup the direct damages (though it doesn't
fully do so as it does not recoup additional adminstrative or legal costs),
It was decided not to add such additional costs to the 21.3 calculation.
If you want to add any of these items to the agenda, please let me know.
If you do so, please send me sample language.
If we could find a fourth we could play doubles assuming that Elizabeth is
coming to the meeting and assuming that there are courts nearby.

Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
"Liability and Damages"), excludes "direct" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.
