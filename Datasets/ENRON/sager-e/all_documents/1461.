Elizabeth -- EPMI or Enron SE Corp. will probably be members of this new 
MAIN/MAPP organization.  Can you have some corporate type comment on these 
attachments?  Thanks.

I don't see anything glaringly wrong in these, but I am not a corporate 
lawyer.  It seems to have section balanced voting at the committee level 
(except that each member gets one vote at the "parent" level, section 6.5 -- 
how is balanced voting assurred there?)  Also, it takes one year to withdraw 
(section 5.7)  It seems like the timing should be shorter, perhaps, 6 
months.  ,I assume that MAPP and MAIN have hired corporate counsel to draft 
these, but JOE do we need to have one of the Enron corporate lawyers look at 
these?

attached is a draft of the bylaws and articles for the proposed RRO,
combining MAIN and MAPP; we have drafted it as a Delaware entity due
to the uncertainty as to where it will be located
