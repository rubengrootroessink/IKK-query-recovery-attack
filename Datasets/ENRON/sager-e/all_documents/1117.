Attorney Client Privilege--Not Discoverable

Here is a final thought about this PX situation before I take off.  In the 
normal give and take of haggling that has been going on since time out of 
mind in trading transactions, there is an element of deception.  The seller 
always bluffs that his product is much more valuable than it actually may be, 
in fact, the less valuable the product, the more the bluffing.  The buyer 
always treats the seller's product with disdain.  It is fundamentally 
necessary for an efficient market to work for buyers and sellers to be able 
to string each other along  with various  posturing gambits.  Price is the 
result of two hagglers finally coming forward out of the smoke surrounding 
their ritual dance  and shaking hands on a number.  By experimenting with the 
nuances of the PX software system  are traders not  merely doing what they 
have been doing since Biblical times,   i.e.  interjecting the absolutely 
essential ingredient of deceptive posturing  into the relatively new form of  
electronic commerce? 

What is the difference between  (a) one of our traders getting on the phone 
when we are short of power and bargaining for a good price  with a supply 
source  as though we have plenty of power and might just be willing to help 
the supplier out if he gives us a good deal,  and  (b) scheduling 3000 mw at 
Silver Peak when there is  15 mw of physical  capacity?  If the technology of 
electronic commerce cannot absorb the artful rituals of  real haggling, maybe 
it should be seen as a temporary experiment and rejected in favor of the time 
honored traditions.  In any event, participants should not be expected to be 
punished for experimenting.   --cgy
