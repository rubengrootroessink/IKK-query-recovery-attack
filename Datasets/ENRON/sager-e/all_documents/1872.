Yes, the cp is required to post to EPMI a standby, letter of credit in the 
amount of $10,000,000 (ten million USD) in a form acceptable to EPMI no later 
than the end of business day, December 7, 2000.

I believe we had a previous confirm that included an l/c requirement...you 
may want to look at the last long term deal for language to insert into this 
confirm...or discuss the language with EPMI legal.

Thanks,
Tracy

I believe you have some language to include with this confirmation?

Thanks!
