Just making sure that you all were still planning on coming by and walking 
around Lights in the Heights with us on Saturday.  We'll have some snacks and 
toddies (sp? and I'm not looking it up) ready around 5:30ish.  I have invited 
Gail to come also, maybe she can fit it her busy social schedule.

Word around here spread like wildfire about my leaving.  I told 3 partners 
before I left to go out of town last week and by the time I got back, even my 
secretary knew.  It was a bit awkward.  I wanted to personally tell her.  Oh 
well.

See you guys Saturday.
