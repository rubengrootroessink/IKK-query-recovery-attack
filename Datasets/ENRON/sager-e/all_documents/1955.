Great - thanks! Colin is the person I have already called three times this 
week. I look forward to hearing from him.

Tracy - can you pls send me a Credit Worksheet for Pacificorp so I can churn 
out an EEI Cover Sheet ? 

Thanks, 

Shari

I spoke with Jon Fryer at Pacificorp and we have agreed to push the EEI 
contract.  He will have Colin Persikety (sp?) follow up with Shari today.

Subject: Margin Agreements

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.
Bill

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft
form of proposed margin agreement.  The threshold amounts can be changed
based on our discussions. While I would prefer to use an EEI agreement,
unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Thanks
