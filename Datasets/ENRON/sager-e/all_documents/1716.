Filings:

 American Aircarriers Support, Incorporated (Nasdaq: AIRS), a South Carolin=
a=20
aircraft maintenance and overhaul provider, filed chapter 11 yesterday in t=
he=20
usual venue (Delaware) together with four subs and says it is in *negations=
*=20
[sic] on DIP financing and already has a deal to sell its landing gear=20
division.  AASI listed assets of $131.4 million versus debts totaling $102.=
5=20
million.

 A good example of the crisis which suddenly overtook the telecom equipment=
=20
sector is Universal Broadband Networks Inc. (Nasdaq:UBNT), whose stock trad=
ed=20
above $20 in March but filed chapter 11 yesterday in Santa Ana, Calif. alon=
g=20
with four subs.  The company blamed its filing on vendors who would no long=
er=20
extend financing.  The company provides microwave and dial up internet acce=
ss.

 Although Medical Arts Laboratory performs nearly half of the lab work in=
=20
Oklahoma, the company and its parent, Southern Medical Arts Cos., filed=20
chapter 11 with debts around $20 million.  The company or affiliates also=
=20
serve Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

Involuntary:

 Ohio insurance regulators barred Credit General Insurance Co. from writing=
=20
new policies, and a bank filed an involuntary petition yesterday in the usu=
al=20
venue (Delaware) against Credit General=02=07s parent, PRS Insurance Group =
Inc. =20
PRS=02=07s companies write multiperil, automobile, surety, and workers' com=
p=20
policies.

Default:

 Spray bottle manufacturer Indesco International, Inc. missed an interest=
=20
payment due in October on $145 million in sub debt.  The default is not=20
surprising given the Caa1 and CCC+ ratings from Moody=02=07s and S&P on the=
 sub=20
debt.  In plain English, ratings in the Caa or CCC range mean that a compan=
y=20
is not generating sufficient cash flow to pay interest and that debt holder=
s=20
are likely to incur a loss in chapter 11.  See F&J Daily Bankr. News of Jul=
y=20
26 of =02=0899 and May 24 of =02=0800.

Troubles:

 The stock of Rent-Way Inc. (NYSE: RWY) crashed 78% after the company=20
announced it had found *accounting irregularities* on the expense side of t=

people who cannot afford outright purchases.  We make no predictions but=20
merely note that in the last year revelations about *accounting=20

Bankr. reform update:

 The Senate is now on track to vote on the bankruptcy reform bill this=20
Friday.  Curiously, this year=02=07s gridlock in Congress is keeping alive =
some=20
hope in lenders=02=07 hearts that the bill could become law despite a Presi=
dential=20
veto.  Ordinarily in an election year, the session would have ended a month=
=20
ago so our elected representatives could return home to campaign.  This yea=
r,=20
the budget is one month late already, and Congress remains hard at work.  I=
n=20
an ordinary year, Senate passage of the bill (the House has already passed=
=20
the legislation) would allow the President to carry out his threatened veto=
,=20
thus affording Congress no opportunity to override since Congress would not=
=20
meet again.  In this exceptional year, Congress may return after the=20
election, thus presenting at least the possibility of overriding a veto. =
=20
Nevertheless, a bank lobbyist sounded pessimistic about a successful overri=
de=20
vote in a lame duck Congress.

Steel again?:

 The domestic steel industry was one of the most troubled sectors of the U.=
S.=20
economy in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, as imports flooded=
=20
the market.  For the past year, we have been writing little about the steel=
=20
industry, but that perhaps is about to change as imports this year are on=
=20
track to surpass the 1998 record.  Also, the price for hot rolled coil, for=
=20
example, has fallen 25% (no typo) in the last few months.

Downgrade:

 The continuing slump in gold prices has forced Kinross Gold Corp. and its=
=20
sub Kinross Gold Inc. to tap out their bank revolver, with the result that=
=20
S&P has knocked the companies=02=07 corporate and sub ratings to BB- and B.=
  The=20
company is also unhedged next year.  Kinross is the fifth largest gold=20
producer in North America.
