Dear Elizabeth,

Pick Your Playground!

We have the cure for the summertime blues, and we'd like to share it 
with you: Get out and play! Isn't that what summer's all about? The 
kids in your life would agree, and so would the kid inside you. Now 
that you're an adult, you may not get three months of summer vacation. 
But on the other hand, the world's your playground. So go ahead--pick 
your playground! Whether you're looking for a romp in Mexico or the 
Caribbean, or fun in the sun in Orlando or Las Vegas, Excite Travel 
can help make your vacation plans a reality.

***FEATURED THIS MONTH***
Orlando
Save $150 on Your Orlando Vacation!
Orlando is one of the greatest all-ages playgrounds in the United 
States. There's Walt Disney World ("the happiest place on earth"), 
cutting-edge rides at Universal Orlando, underwater fun at SeaWorld, 
and more. If you haven't visited in a few years, come see what's new 
in Orlando! 

Jamaica
Win a Seven-Night Caribbean Cruise!
Reggae and rays. If that doesn't sound like fun, we don't know what 
does. Jamaica has that great Caribbean combination of laid-back 
mellowness combined with lively nightlife and tons of daytime 
activities. So lie back and relax on the beach. Or set off on an 
adventure exploring Dunn's River Falls, hiking, or scuba diving. 
The choice is yours. Book now!

Cabo San Lucas
Discover the Many Moods of Mexico!
Cabo San Lucas is world-famous for providing fun in the sun--and 
after the sun goes down, too. The waters of the Sea of Cortez are 
fabulous for water sports including diving, fishing, and sailing. 
There's also world-class golf. And after dark, the city throws a 
great party just about any night of the year. Don't let the town's 
small size fool you--there's enough fun here to fill a major city. 

Las Vegas
Vacation in Style at Caesars Palace!
The only hard part of a Vegas vacation is deciding what not to do. 
That, and picking a hotel! One property you can't go wrong with is 
Caesars Palace. Caesars celebrates the decadence of the Roman Empire 
with gorgeous gardens, sumptuous restaurants, and a 23,000 square-foot 
spa. As they say, when in Rome...
