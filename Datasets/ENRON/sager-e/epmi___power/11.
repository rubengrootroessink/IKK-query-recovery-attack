Dear Elizabeth:

Here are several sections of the current protocols.   These are from the ones 
filed Jan 5, 2001 and from what i understand are the ones that were adopted 
by the PUCT.   You may want to verify that with Jean Ryall

Section 16.2.5 is the credit section.  I will send you the other information 
soon.  This is just to start you off.

Regards,

Smith Day
