Hi Elizabeth,

How are you ? Things are fine here except very busy. I am ready for the
weekend - I am going to Mississippi to see my family and relax!

I just wanted to pass on our new definition of PJM Capacity Credits which
Dede worked on with our PJM marketer. I got a another definition from
Exelon who said that they had stolen it from Enron.(!)  Dede seems to think
this one is better and more current so here it is:

(See attached file: Capacity Credit Definition (8.29.01).doc)

We are going to start adding it as a definition under the EEI with
counterparties with whom we trade this product.
