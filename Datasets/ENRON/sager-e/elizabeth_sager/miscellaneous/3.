David,
Confirming our phone conversation earlier today, the changes you recommend
to the NRG and Enron power guaranties (June 29, 2001) are acceptable.  These
changes pertain to documenting in the power guaranties the partial
cancellation of the prior multi-commodity guaranties issued in 2000.

In addition, the proposed "Amended and Restated" Enron multi-commodity
guaranty is acceptable, although NRG views the current multi-commodity
guaranties as interim guaranties, pending negotiation of the ISDA credit
terms.  At that time NRG plans to cancel its year 2000 guaranty and issue a
new guaranty reflecting the ISDA negotiations.  How does Enron plan to
accommodate the ISDA negotiations in its multi-commodity guaranty?

In my absence, Bob Striker will continue to work with you to complete these
documents.

Jean
