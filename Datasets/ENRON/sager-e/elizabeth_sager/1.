eProcurement

You have been identified as a future user of eProcurement.  eProcurement is coming to Enron Wholesale Services on Monday,  July 2nd! 

Keep this information to help you transition to the new eProcurement system.

When should I use eProcurement?
Use eProcurement to buy:
*  Office Supplies:  toner cartridges, printer paper, tablets, pens, and more!
*  IT Hardware:  new hire workstations, monitors, printers, keyboards, etc.     

How does eProcurement work?
*  Go to <http://ibuyit.enron.com> and logon to eProcurement.
*  Use the catalog or a template to fill the shopping cart and order the items.
*  The request will be processed and fulfilled.  It's that easy!

If the shopping cart requires additional approval:	
*  The shopping cart will automatically be routed for approval based on the requestor's reporting structure and the monetary approval limits of their business unit.
*  The approver will receive e-mail notification that there is a shopping cart that requires their approval.  
*  The approver will log onto eProcurement and accept or reject the shopping cart.
*  Upon rejection, the requestor will receive e-mail notification that their shopping cart was rejected.
*  Upon approval, the shopping cart will be processed and your order fulfilled.         
*  Note:  if the shopping cart exceeds your spend limit or contains IT hardware items it will require additional approval/review.
