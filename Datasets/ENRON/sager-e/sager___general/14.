I am sure you'all have all the CLE you probably need, but just in case you do 
not, there is an easy way to catch up!  You can earn CLE credits through 
several websites on the internet!  The advantage of this is that all you need 
is a computer with an internet connection.  You can "attend" when you want, 
24 hours a day, from your home or the office!   Some will allow you to log 
your time which enables you to break away from the "seminar" to finish at a 
later time.   There is a fee in most cases.  You can register on-line or by 
phone, and can charge it to your credit card with either registration 
method.  

The websites I know about are listed below.  There are probably more if you 
do an internet search for "CLE".

http://www.abanet.org/cle/clenow/
http://www.cle.com
http://www.law.legalseminars.com
http://www.cle-net.edu
http:/www.cleonline.com

The first two listed are on the Texas Bar and American Bar Associations' 
websites.
