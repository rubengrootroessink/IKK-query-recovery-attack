Enron's Collapse Has Experts Questioning Future of Electric  Deregulation
The collapse of energy company Enron has several  experts questioning its i=
mpacts on the future of electric deregulation. Analysts  say that the compa=
ny's public championing of electric deregulation in Florida  and its curren=
t financial situation might signal caution to state regulators.  "Enron was=
 the most visible and ardent cheerleader of deregulation, and I think  what=
's happened to them is going to raise all these questions about  deregulati=
on," says Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute.  Another v=
iew comes from Steven Weiss of the Center of Responsive Politics in  Washin=
gton, who says that politicians may step away from deregulation because  th=
ey view Enron "like a rotten egg." Other insiders believe that Enron's  sit=
uation may be another reason that Florida's Governor Jeb Bush has postponed=
  any movement toward deregulation until after his 2002 re-election campaig=
n. Jon  Cartwright, a senior energy analyst with Raymond James & Associates=
, says  that it will be difficult for deregulation plans to be completely h=
alted, but  Enron is going to give regulators something to think about in a=
ddition to  California's problems with deregulation.
Retail Choice Available in Massachusetts
Dominion  Retail Inc. has become the first residential supplier to enter Ma=
ssachusetts'  near-moribund competitive retail electricity market. Until no=
w, no companies  have attempted to enter the state's retail marketplace. Ro=
b Wilson, a spokesman  from Massachusetts Division of Telecommunications an=
d Energy, said that low  electric rates have made the market unattractive f=
or new power providers. He  also said suppliers were deterred by the nature=
 of the default/standard-offer  system that tends to spread potential custo=
mers in the default group over a  broad area. Dominion will offer an altern=
ative choice of power supply to  Massachusetts Electric's 270,000 residenti=
al customers who are now receiving  their power on default service. Default=
 customers can receive their power from  Dominion at $66.31 per month if th=
ey commit to a three-year deal, which is  slightly less than the $67.75 ave=
rage cost for Massachusetts Electric default  customers. However, it is sti=
ll more than the proposed $57.56 per month that an  average Massachusetts E=
lectric standard-offer customer will pay beginning  January 1, 2002, pendin=
g state approval. Currently there are already several  companies competing =
for commercial and industrial customers in the state's  electric marketplac=

Consumer Choice Drives Green Power Market
A new  study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the L=
awrence  Berkeley National Lab's Environmental Energy Technology Division h=
as found that  consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy so=
urces. If consumers  are given the choice, they will choose power from clea=
ner sources such as wind,  solar, geothermal, and biomass. The study says t=
hat in order for green power to  gain full support in the marketplace, rest=
ructuring should proceed without delay  and that market rules in restructur=
ed markets should be conducive to  competition. "Our study shows that givin=
g consumers energy supply choices can be  a powerful mechanism for moving r=
enewable energy into the marketplace," says  Blair Swezey of NREL, coauthor=
 of the study entitled "Forecasting the Growth of  Green Power Markets in t=
he United States." Under the best conditions, use of  green power could gro=
w 40 percent in less than a decade, to a capacity of 7,000  megawatts. Howe=
ver, the study concludes that it is more likely that renewables  will exper=
ience a slow growth in the market. In addition to a competitive  marketplac=
e, vigorous promotion and education will also be necessary to ensure  the s=
uccess of green power.

Electricity Bill Will Be Put Off Until Next  Year
The House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee is preparing  an electricity =
bill that will focus on increasing power supplies and improving  electricit=
y transmission from one part of the country to another. Subcommittee  Chair=
man Joe Barton (R-TX) has not set a date for markup, an aide said, but aims=
  to consider the bill during the first two weeks of December. Accordingly,=
 Energy  and Commerce Committee Chairman, Billy Tauzin (R-La) announced at =
a news  conference yesterday that he expects to receive the bill for consid=
eration by  the year's end. Chairman Tauzin told reporters that Congress sh=
ould allow states  to make their own decisions regarding siting transmissio=
n facilities within  their boundaries, but that interstate projects might r=
equire Federal  intervention. He also noted that grid connections among sta=
tes are necessary for  regional transmission organizations as a means to ex=
pand the grid and eliminate  electricity bottlenecks. Separately, Senate Ma=
jority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD)  is expected to introduce a Senate energy =
bill that includes an electricity  title, but said that the Senate will not=
 consider it until next  year.
FERC Underestimated Environmental Impacts of  Competition
The final environmental impact statement the Federal  Energy Regulatory Com=
mission (FERC) completed for Order 888 underestimated the  effects that a c=
ompetitive wholesale power market would have on air pollutants,  a new stud=
y says. Synapse Energy Economics, a Massachusetts-based firm, prepared  the=
 study for the commission. It reviewed the accuracy of FERC's predictions o=
n  the effects competition would have on the environment in the year 2000. =
The most  important conclusion from the analysis is that FERC's modeling me=
thodology was  too narrowly defined to capture the effects, the report says=
. Synapse found that  FERC did not fully consider the impacts from increase=
s in electricity demand,  improvements in nuclear plant efficiency, and the=
 extension of nuclear and coal  plant lifetimes. The study concludes that F=
ERC's forecast of NOx emissions was  roughly four percent lower than actual=
 experience and its forecast of CO2  emissions was roughly eight percent lo=
wer. Also, the report finds that FERC  underestimated actual national elect=
ricity demand through 2000 by 4.6 percent.  The North American Commission f=
or Environmental Cooperation, a panel created  under the North American Fre=
e Trade Agreement, was expected to address  these findings and other enviro=
nmental concerns among the United States, Canada,  and Mexico at a forum he=
ld November 29-30, 2001, in San Diego.
Michigan PSC Protects Consumers from Retail  Slamming
The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has  adopted standards to pro=
tect retail electric consumers from slamming and  cramming. Slamming is the=
 unauthorized switching from one electric customer from  electric service p=
rovider to another, while cramming is the billing of a  customer for unauth=
orized electric services. The Customer Choice and Reliability  Act of 2000 =
requires that the Commission issue orders to protect Michigan's  electric c=
ustomers from slamming and cramming and authorizes the Commission to  condu=
ct contested proceedings to investigate any violations. Under the new  meas=
ures, customers may authorize switching of their electric service provider =
 through written authorization, a call to a toll-free telephone number voic=
e  response unit, a Web-based connection, notice to an appropriately qualif=
ied  third party, or a three-way call between the new supplier, the custome=
r, and the  older supplier. New suppliers must notify customers and the exi=
sting provider  within seven days of the requested change in service. Viola=
tors can be fined up  to $30,000 for the first offense, up to $50,000 for t=
he second offense, and up  to $70,000 for repeated violations.
Michigan PSC Approves Commonwealth Energy as Alternative  Supplier
The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has  approved Commonwealth En=
ergy Corporation's application to sell electric  generation to Michigan ret=
ail customers. The commission approved Commonwealth's  license to be the 12=
th alternative electric supplier in the state under the  Customer Choice an=
d Electricity Reliability Act of 2000. The state regulators  concluded that=
 approval of the alternative electric supplier license would  expand the op=
portunities for retail electric competition in the state. The  commission g=
ranted the license conditioned upon Commonwealth providing electric  servic=
e within a reasonable time and indicated that failure to do so may result  =
in revocation of the license. Commonwealth will operate in Michigan under t=
he  name ElectricAmerica.
Hearing Held on Pennsylvania's Electric  Deregulation
The Pennsylvania House Democratic Policy Committee  held a hearing on elect=
ric deregulation on November 28, 2001, during which  witnesses testified on=
 the state's future electricity needs and the impacts of  deregulation. The=
 committee is concerned about whether enough power plants will  be built to=
 meet the state's future demand. Robert Hinkle of PJM  Interconnection, whi=
ch manages the mid-Atlantic transmission grid and serves as  a wholesale el=
ectricity market, said that 4,000 megawatts of increased  electricity capac=
ity are planned for the next three years. With this increase,  the region's=
 capacity would reach 60,000 megawatts, which is more than  sufficient to m=
eet the region's electricity needs for the foreseeable future,  Hinkle said=
. Richard Maurer, of Local 29 International Brotherhood of Electrical  Work=
ers, testified that deregulation has resulted in layoffs and more burdens o=
n  an increasingly aging work force that his union represents. On the other=
 hand,  Duquesne Light Company President Victor Rogue told the committee th=
at  Pennsylvania's electric deregulation has been a success. Rogue said tha=
t  Duquesne Light customers have been protected from steep rate increase an=
d can  expect an estimated 16 percent decline in the rates early next year.
Northeast May See Increased Power Costs
Energy  Security Analysis (ESAI), a Boston-based consulting firm, reports t=
hat urban  areas in the Northeast may experience increased power prices unl=
ess investments  are made in regional power generation and transmission sys=
tems. ESAI director Ed  Krapels said that, while electricity restructuring =
resulted in new power plant  construction in many states, urban areas remai=
n at risk for higher prices.  ESAI's 10-year power price forecast report fo=
r New England says that 2003 and  2004 are "shaping up as years with premiu=
ms close to the double digits in both  on- and off-peak markets" for the Ne=
w York Power Pool unless additional power  and transmission are developed. =
The report also concludes that Boston and  southwestern Connecticut will re=
quire additional generation and transmission "to  keep their urban premiums=
 in check." The forecast estimates that premiums in the  PJM region could i=
ncrease by $10 per megawatt should no new generation be  developed. However=
, new transmission projects will likely stimulate the  development of the n=
ew generation projects that are currently stalled. New  generation will hel=
p stabilize the New Jersey market as well as contribute to  New York City's=
 power needs.
Ontario Power planning long-term debt offering in new  year
Ontario Power Generation is planning a long-term debt  offering some time n=
ext year, the company said yesterday. "We do intend to tap  the long-term m=
arket for the first time next year," Ronald Osborne, president  and chief e=
xecutive officer, told reporters following an industry breakfast in  Toront=
o. Mr. Osborne could not provide details on the proposed offering, but  sai=
d it would most likely be a long-term, or possibly medium-term, issue. This=
  would be the first long-term debt offering for the company, which was spu=
n off  from debt-ridden Ontario Hydro in the 1990s. Mr. Osborne said the pr=
oceeds from  the offering would be used to replace old Ontario Hydro debt t=
hat has reached  maturity. By the middle of next year, Ontario Power expect=
s to pay off  $400-million of debt. Ontario Power is one of two main spinof=
fs of Ontario  Hydro. The other is Hydro One,which is slated to become a pu=
blicly traded  company following the planned deregulation of the market nex=
t year. Ontario  Power is readying itself for the electricity market to ope=
n to competition next  year. The province has already pushed back its origi=
nal November, 2000, deadline  for electricity-system deregulation by 18 mon=
ths.
Rates Decrease For Texas Provider of Last  Resort
The Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) and Assurance  Energy have agreed=
 to reduce previously announced rates for guaranteed back-up  electric serv=
ice in the Houston area and south Texas when retail competition  begins on =
January 1, 2002. Assurance Energy will be the provider of last resort  (POL=
R) for residential and small non-residential customers in these areas of  T=
exas. As a POLR, Assurance is required to assure continued service at a fix=
ed  non-discountable rate to consumers who have been dropped by their curre=
nt  electric provider. The new prices will be 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (=
kWh) for  summer months and 7.4 cents per kWh for non-summer months, compar=
ed to the  previous respective prices of 12.5 cents per kWh and 9.5 cents p=
er kWh. The  previous agreement was negotiated early this year when the pri=
ce for natural  gas, a major fuel for generating electricity, reached histo=
rical highs.  Currently, natural gas prices are substantially lower.
Louisiana Considers a Limited Deregulation  Plan
The Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC) is  considering a limited ele=
ctricity deregulation plan that would allow large  energy consumers to shop=
 for competitive rates. Under the plan, companies that  use five megawatts =
or more of energy would be allowed the option of leaving the  regulated mar=
ket every two years starting in 2003. The proposed plan does not  include r=
etail competition for residential or small business consumers. Not all  com=
missioners support the plan, however; Commissioner Don Owen has said that h=
e  does not think deregulation will benefit electricity users in the state.=
  Opposition to the proposal has also come from the Louisiana Energy Users =
Group  (LEUG) and the Louisiana Midcontinent Oil and Gas Association, which=
 maintain  that large industrial users should be given the choice to leave =
the market  annually. The groups also argue that the plan hampers large ind=
ustrial customers  from building cogeneration plants because of a provision=
 that requires large  industrial cogenerators to pay a stranded costs recov=
ery fee. Industrial  customers with new cogeneration facilities are allowed=
 to apply for an  exemption. The PSC has not yet determined the stranded co=
st fee structure under  the proposed deregulation plan. David Dismukes, an =
associate professor of energy  studies at Louisiana State University, says =
that this uncertainty may make  companies hesitant to build cogeneration pl=
ants. State regulators had included  the fee in the proposed plan so that s=
tranded cost recovery would not be  unfairly shifted to residential ratepay=
ers who remain in the regulated system.  The PSC is scheduled to vote on th=
e plan next month.
Deregulation in Mississippi Not Expected Soon
In a  recent speech to the Vicksburg Civic Club, Public Service Commissione=
r Nielsen  Cochran said it is unlikely that Mississippi will soon open its =
electricity  market to competition. Cochran explained that, in order for co=
mpetition or  deregulation to work, there must be a greater abundance of ge=
neration options in  the state. After two years of hearings that ended in 1=
999, the Public Service  Commission advised lawmakers that Mississippi was =
not ready for deregulation.  Cochran said that deregulation would result in=
 more expensive electricity rates  for consumers across the state.
Texas Electricity Provider Opposes Texas Deregulation  Delay
The New Power Company, an electricity provider that is  participating in Te=
xas' pilot deregulation program, said that it opposes  delaying the January=
 1, 2002, start of electricity deregulation. New Power has  been a major pl=
ayer in the pilot program, but has experienced its share of  obstacles alon=
g the way. Computer glitches have caused the company to send out  customer =
bills late and at times without appropriate charges. Representatives  from =
the company say that the company needs information from companies that  ope=
rate the electricity transmission and metering systems in order to issue  a=
ccurate bills. New Power and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, whi=
ch  is responsible for making the information available, have been communic=
ating to  improve the situation. New Power is confident that its problems w=
ill be resolved  in time for the January 1, 2002, deregulation date. The Pu=
blic Utility  Commission requested comments from electricity companies on w=
hether the state  should move the date back from January 1, 2002.
New California crisis: Too much electricity
A man  approaches a woman in a grocery-store aisle and asks whether she wou=
ld rather  have dinner with him tonight. Sorry, she replies, she'll be doin=
g her laundry  late this evening. And not tomorrow night, either, because s=
he'll be doing her  vacuuming in those off-peak hours. Energy conservation,=
 you know. Californians  have been forced to watch this state government TV=
 commercial over and over in  recent months, but are now rolling their eyes=
 at its outdated message. The  Governor ordered the ads advocating radical =
energy conservation after an  unprecedented wave of blackouts that plagued =
the state earlier this year. But if  ads were being ordered now, they might=
 suggest that Californians turn on extra  lights, plug in some heavy applia=
nces and run their air conditioners at full  blast. In only a few months, C=
alifornia has gone from an energy drought to a  flood, in which the state i=
s now forced to sell or give away a glut of excess  electricity at prices f=
ar below those it paid. California's double-whammy energy  crisis -- a shor=
tage followed by an overstock -- serves as a cautionary tale for  other jur=
isdictions looking to privatize their utilities.  California led  the way i=
n placing its electricity on the open market, and last year fell prey  to w=
hat some describe as a failure in its regulatory structure, and what  Gover=
nor Grey Davis calls "a monumental scam" committed by power-generating  com=
panies against the state. One thing is certain: When electricity demand was=
  driven up by poor weather last January, generators began charging the sta=
te  prices hundreds of times more than what it had paid only months before.=
 Because  California bought its power on a day-by-day basis, prices fluctua=
ted  dramatically: One generator billed the state $3,880 (U.S.) for a megaw=
att that  had cost $29 the previous year. And because most of the state's u=
tilities had  capped domestic rates, the price increase had to be borne by =
the state treasury.  Mr. Davis now claims that the state is owed a refund o=
f more than $9-billion  from those generators. Federal regulators agree wit=
h him, although the amount of  the refund still must be negotiated. However=
, the crisis left the state with  debts in the tens of billions of dollars,=
 consumer electrical rates were raised  by 43 per cent and people were terr=
ified by days of rolling, random blackouts  that threatened to drive busine=
sses away from California's already beleaguered  economy. Now Mr. Davis is =
coming under fire for his solution to that crisis: As  the blackouts were t=
aking place, he signed $43-billion worth of long-term power  contracts, som=
e of them for many years, at rates averaging $69 a megawatt. These  seemed =
to provide stability, but now they seem onerous: With demand for oil and  n=
atural gas dropping in the wake of Sept. 11, rosy weather forecasts and doz=
ens  of new generating stations coming on line, open-market energy prices h=
ave  dropped below $20 a megawatt. Suddenly, California faces the prospect =
of paying  tens of billions of dollars a year above market rates for electr=
icity. "Our  children and grandchildren will be the ones who have to pay fo=
r his mistakes,"  said Richard Riordan, former mayor of Los Angeles and Mr.=
 Davis's chief  Republican opponent. To make matters worse, those energy-co=
nservation TV ads  appear to have worked too well. Californians are now usi=
ng less electricity per  capita than any other state. While this is applaud=
ed by utility officials and  environmentalists, it leaves California with c=
ontracts for far more electricity  than it needs. Energy companies, which h=
ad rushed in to build or upgrade power  plants during this year's crisis, h=
ave been scaling back dramatically. Since  September, at least half a dozen=
 planned generating stations have been  cancelled. But experts warn that th=
is, too, could backfire, warning that  California could be hit by another r=
ound of blackouts in five years.
