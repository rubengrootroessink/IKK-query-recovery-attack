Tim,

I believe we will have five large wires today.  Four will be for power prepayments in the west (we already have two, and are waiting on the last two), and one will be to NEPOOL to maintain our three-day rolling prepay (this keeps us alive in NEPOOL).  Evelyn Aucoin is pulling them together right now, and hopefully we will have all five to you before noon.

The wires in the West should hold us over until next week.  We will have another wire to NEPOOL tomorrow, which we will do early in the morning.

Thanks,

Don
