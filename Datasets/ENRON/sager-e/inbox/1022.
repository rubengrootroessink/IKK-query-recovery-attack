The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 26, 2001 is:  -2.

The  daily press commentary provided one with an opportunity to be either pessimistic or optimistic as one's predisposition  dictated.  Does the fact that it was a day when no fresh and negative revelations were published mean it was a good day or a bad day?  Take your pick. 

Not a single crow was sighted on this cold day.  Nothing to base augury upon.  There must have been days like this in ancient Rome when the Senators gazed out across a bleak landscape and saw no birds.
