jane, i think it would be a good idea if you could talk internally at broadband and come up with ONE operations person to contact with respect to any operational issues on distressed/bankrupt counterparties to coordinate at ebs. that person may end up having to talk to a number of people at broadband to coordinate there once decisions are reached. that person could be in charge of getting numbers for proofs of claim, terminating service etc. our rejection stipulation is filed but not signed by judge. i told them to terminate the others before sept. 1 as i recall because we could get out of the other side without damages. it was even pulled out of the book....

Lisa,

Is there formal documentation supporting rejection that would allow us to terminate service?  I think we should have a meeting with Barry Pearce to put in place a process how to handle bankrupties from an operations perspective.

Thanks,

you are kidding me aren't you?
they were terminating all but the new york to miami one. 
why would we be billing and providing service on the others?

We are still billing and providing service for all of the circuits we sold to Winstar.  Were we supposed to stop billing and service on the date they rejected the particular circuit?  or continue as is?

Please advise,
