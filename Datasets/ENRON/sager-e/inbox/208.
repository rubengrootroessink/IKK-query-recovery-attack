                             Beware: The PTO rules of practice now restrict=
 the use of hyperlinks in patent applications. According to M.P.E.P. Sectio=
n 608.01, Examiners must now review applications to make sure that hyperlin=
ks and other forms of browser-executable code are not included in the text =
of the application, unless the hyperlink or browser-executable code is part=
 of the applicant's invention and therefore must be included in the applica=
tion in order to comply with 35 U.S.C. Section 112 (and as long as the appl=
icant does notintend to have the link be active). The end result is that Ex=
aminers will (or at least should) now require any such unnecessary hyperlin=
ks or browser-executable code to be deleted from patent applications. Furth=
er, and perhaps more importantly, M.P.E.P. Section 608.01(p) now prohibits =
incorporation of subject matter by reference to a hyperlink or browser-exec=
utable code. The PTO's rationale for this rule of practice is that they don=
't want patents or applicat! ions on their web site including links to comm=
ercial sites that they don't control. (As for links that are part of the ap=
plicant's invention, the PTO will disable the links before posting the text=
 on their web site.).   One way to work within this new rule of practice ma=
y be to rephrase any such link or code in a way that a computer won't detec=
t as a hyperlink or browser-executable code, but that a reader will underst=
and sufficiently to be able to refer to the referenced site. For instance, =
in a hyperlink that is normally phrased as http:// followed by a URL addres=
s, consider inserting a space between the "http:" and the "//". Only time a=
nd further experience will tell if this workaround will work.   To discuss =
