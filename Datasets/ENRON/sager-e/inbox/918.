Anne, For your first question, I'll need to consult the merger agreement.
I'm out of the office at a meeting right now so I will get back to you on
that.

As for the employee meeting, if it is onlu available "real-time" it would be
considered an oral communication and would not need to be filed -- even if
you could call in.  However, if a video, audio or transcriptt is made
available after the presentation -- including on the website -- then it
would need to be filed.

Also, I emailed to Lance this morning a draft of some guidelines for which
type of communications would need to be filed.  I will forward it to you
also when I get back to the office.  I hope this is helpful.

Nicole
