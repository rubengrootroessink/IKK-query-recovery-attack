As discussed with Tom today, and a while ago with Ed, I'm forwarding for yo=
ur review and comment the current state of development of several Energy Ma=
rketing Service Agreement templates.  These are all prepared solely as to t=
he marketing of power, and do not cover provision of fuel or performing any=
 origination work for Customers.  The templates attached are: (1) the hourl=
y/day-ahead template (or "extreme short form EMSA"), unchanged from what wa=
s circulated 9-7-01 for comment, (2) an EMSA for use with a Customer owning=
 a generator (similar to Mobile, SPSA situation), (3) an EMSA template for =
use with a Customer owning a mix of purchased power (under "PPAs") and gene=
ration, (together referenced as "Resources"), and (4) a credit support anne=
x, for use when appropriate with the forms referenced as items 2 and 3.  Pl=
ease pay particular attention to the draft Exhibit A to the item 2 & 3 temp=
lates, where the manner in which services will be compensated remains to be=
 worked out.  Redlining in the "PPA & Gen" EMSA template (Item 3) mostly in=
dicates changes from the "Gen only" template (Item 2).   Please come back t=
o me with questions, comments, or redlines of any changes you may want to s=
uggest.  --David
