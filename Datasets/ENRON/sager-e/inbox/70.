A  friend is giving a seminar next week if anyone is interested in going.   
 
 
 
 
With the uncertainty in financial markets and  changes taking place in everything from the way we do business to  how we think about our lives, this seminar will address how to plan our  financial futures from where to invest now to planning techniques in  investments and estate planning.
 
Having navigated client investments through  previous wars and shocks to the economy, I will discuss the state of the economy  and asset allocation techniques for your investments in this precarious  time.  Other topics discussed :  retirement planning under the new tax  act and determining your risk tolerance.
 
I look forward to seeing you at this informative  seminar.  Feel free to bring interested parties.
 
regards,
