To All,

Please see transcript for Moyers in Conversation with Robert Lipton.
'America Responds' section: www.pbs.org/americaresponds/moyers.html. I
believe the perspective is interesting and correct.

Let me know what you think?

MOYERS IN CONVERSATION
Broadcast September 17, 2001
BILL MOYERS (BM): It's been almost a week now, and the questions continue to
pile up:
What kind of people would do this?
What do they want?
How do we witness death on this scale and go on with our lives?
What do we do about the rage we feel?
What does it mean to realize how vulnerable we suddenly are?

My guest tonight is uniquely qualified to help us answer these questions.
Robert Lifton has wrestled with some of the most disturbing events of the
time. Trained in psychology and psychiatry, 40 years ago he went to
Hiroshima to listen to the survivors of the world's first nuclear bombing
explosion. His book won the National Book Award.

I could not find information on your website regarding the September 17,
2001 - Bill Moyers coverage of the terrorist attacks on the United States
that on which he had a conversation, I believe, with a professor from NYU.
I would like to get a transript of that conversation, the name of that
individual plus a list of books, articles etc., this individual may have
written.  The conversation focused on religious fundamentalism. The
dialogue was very enlightening.

Thanks for your help in providing the requested information.
