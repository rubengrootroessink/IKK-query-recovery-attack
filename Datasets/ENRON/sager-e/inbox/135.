     Please see attached.  While I am not opposed to the formation of the
ESIB, I have several concerns based on preliminary indications that the
EISB will publish a "standardized" contract for wholesale power
transactions.  I'd like to avoid a third or even fourth (if you consider
ERCOT still to be a viable option) U.S. based wholesale power agreement.
As it appears that the formation of EISB is going forward, and has FERC
endorsement, it might be worthwhile to attend this workshop.  Please let me
know your thoughts.

We wanted to provide you information about this upcoming meeting, which
may be of interest to your company.  We would appreciate it if you would
pass this along to the appropriate member of your staff.

EEI will conduct a one-day workshop to focus issues and discuss options
related to the formation of the Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB).
The workshop will take place on Friday, November 9, at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   The meeting will take
place from  8 a.m. - 4 p.m.  The purpose of the meeting is to gather EEI
member input on EISB formation issues related to both wholesale and retail
electric standards.

As you know, the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) recently expanded its
charter to include the development of electricity standards.  FERC Chairman
Pat Wood has endorsed this action, as well as Commissioner Massey and
Commissioner Brownell.  Business practice standardization issues will be
discussed this week at the FERC RTO workshops, focusing on a potential
regulatory role in defining candidates for standardized business practices.

For hotel accommodations, please contact the hotel directly at 972-453-1234
and ask for the EEI GISB-EISB special room rate of $119/night.

A meeting registration information and response form is attached.  We will
provide briefing materials to workshop participants in advance of the
meeting.

For additional information, please contact Dave Dworzak, Manager,
Transmission Policy at 202-508-5684 or at ddworzak@eei.org if you have any
questions or need more information.
