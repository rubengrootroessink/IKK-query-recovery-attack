     H Alex 

     Thanks for the picture - she's beautiful! 

     Total lunacy is raging here - My employers stock has dropped from 65 
     to , 
     today 7, in less than a month.  The climate is perfectly toxic.  Such 
     craziness I never imagined possible.  Hope to talk to you soon with 
     things 
     ....who know.
