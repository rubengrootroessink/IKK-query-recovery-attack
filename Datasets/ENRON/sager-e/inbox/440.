Carol,

This file represents in and out collateral, cash, LC, sureties and securities. The Onicas are still trying to reconcile the cash position with acctng and is subject to correction.
I've sent you a margin report via interoffice mail....the downloaded file is pretty messy.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks

Debbie and/or Tanya:
Could you please send me an updated list of LC's that we have posted and that have been posted to us.  Also, could you please send me a margin report that sets forth margin posted to and from our trading counterparties?  We will be beginning the process of responding to termination letters and this information will be helpful to us.  Thanks.


Susan and Stephanie:
For the global chart please set up a column for margin as we need to track margin that we have posted and margin that has been posted to us.
