Attached is a quick draft which is based substantially off the Settlement Agreement.  I didn't change the references to EPMI or power even though it is my understanding that we are looking more at physical and financial gas deals.

Please give me a call with any comments 416-318-5230 cell or send an email.

Regards
Chris
