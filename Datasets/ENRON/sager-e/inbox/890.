Dan:

Attached you can find the proposed draft confirmations for two sets of ring trades between EPMI/PGET/and Constellation.  These are proposals for discussion purposes only, and are subject to further commercial, legal, and credit approval.  Please forward on to your attorney, Peter Meier, since I do not have his email address.

Regards,
Tracy

Carol brought to my attention that you could not pull up the attachments that I previously sent via email.  Here you go again.  Thanks, Tracy
