Item Description:
	53cm (21 in) Cannondale Criterium Road/Racing Bike

You are bidding on an aluminum frame Cannondale Criterium, Model 8R300, 53cm bicycle.
I am the original and only owner of this bike. This bike is white with blue lettering. The components are the original Suntour Accushift alpha-3040 group. Also included are: Time criterium pedals with shoe cleats, a Profile Aerobar, a Cateye Vectra CC-7000 computer
(needs battery), Mistral rims, a Vetta saddle, and Diacompe brakes. I am also including a Zefel hp
X3 pump that fits nicely beneath the top tube, which is not shown. The small blue saddle bag shown in the photo is the only accessory not included.

This bike has been hanging in my garage by the stem and saddle (not by the rims) for the last few
years. The tires have gone down, but will hold air for a few days. It does have a few paint chips on the front fork (see photo) and there is surface rust in these chips, on the rear freewheel, and on
the chain.

With a good cleaning, good lube, and new rubber this will be an awesome bike at a great price. Don't miss this great chance to get atop Cannondale Craftsmanship.

Shipping: I will take to this bike to a bicycle shop in the 37127 or 37064 area for packaging and shipping. Winning bidder will pay the final bid plus actual packaging and shipping costs.
I estimate about $50 total S&H. Call your local bike shop, or call a bike shop in the zipcode areas listed to get an estimate.

Payment: If you want to use a credit card for payment you can click on the Bidpay icon below to order a
Bidpay money order. I will also accept payment by check (must clear my credit union) or US money
order (ships upon receipt).

Other: I reserve the right to cancel this auction as this bike is also for sale locally.

Good Luck and thank for looking!
