Elizabeth: 
Now that the Federal Estate Tax Return has been filed, you should think about making a substantial distribution from the Trust to the individual trust accounts for you and your siblings.  Some funds should be held back in case of an audit of the Return.  I think $100,000 would be a safe number to keep in the account.
I called the Virginia attorney and left a message for him.  I hope he has gotten the Estate opened by now. 
How have you progressed with getting the IRA distributed.  Please give me an update.
