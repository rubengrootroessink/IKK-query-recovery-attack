Hi!
Maybe email is the best way to talk!!! I actually do most of my communicating this way anyway! I went to yoga last Wednesday night AND Saturday afternoon. While I enjoyed the Wednesday class, I hated the Saturday class. It was a younger crowd and there were too many people. I will continue to go to the Wednesday class but never again on the Saturday one. However, I like your idea of going on Sundays and I would not like to get stuck with just one instructor. You are welcome to come on Wednesdays too, it is 1 1/2 blocks away from my house at 6:30.
Let me know what you think!
Susan
