There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the line would gain personal knowledge of the presence of old friends, even relatives, being directly across the lines, back there in the mass of enemey troops.  The Union General Hancock had been a very close friend of the Confederate General Armsted and on the eve of the final day at Gettysburg,  had a moment or two remembering their good old days together in California.  Wolfe and Krebs are out there somewhere "on the other side."  Although I must candidly confess that officer Krebs does not rank high in my humble judgement and is not among the significant players in the combat,  Wolfe does.  Wolfe was a player.  He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to "them" and not to "us" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missing a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joining AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working out of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete agreement is still in force.
