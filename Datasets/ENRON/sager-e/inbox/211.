Willis,

We've reviewed the application Enron submitted for participation in Virtual
Transactions.  In order to complete the registration process, the following
points need to be addressed:

a)  The Acknowledgement and Certification for participation in Virtual
Transactions has been determined to be incomplete.  We've discussed that
the document notes Enron North America as the applicant.  If this is the
case, we will need additional information, including signed tariff
agreements, in order to process this application.  If the applicant is one
of our current Enron affiliates which are NYISO market participants, Enron
Energy Services, or Enron Power Marketing, the Acknowledgement and
Certification document needs to be revised and resubmitted, with of course,
a value of the mwhs intended for bidding.

b)  The registration material indicates that Enron intends to submit an
Irrevocable Letter of Credit.  Please advise if you intend to submit our
standard format, which is included in the NYISO Financial Assurance Policy
(Addendum B of the Registration Packet).  For your convenience, the Packet
is attached.  If you plan on submitting any other format, be it your own,
or a revised version of the standard format, you should forward a draft of
that document as soon as possible.  A review fee of $500 would apply, as
outlined in the Financial Assurance Policy.  Please advise if you wish us
to review the document.  If so, we will forward you wire transfer
information for the fee processing.

If you have any questions, please contact me or your Customer Relations
Representative.
