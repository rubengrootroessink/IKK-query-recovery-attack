Elizabeth - Can you please have one of your attys forward a draft of the power netting agmt to South Carolina E&G.  It is my understanding that trading will be curtailed (if not already shut down) until this agmt is in place.  Luara will provide your atty a contact to forward the document to.

Thanks.

Ed
