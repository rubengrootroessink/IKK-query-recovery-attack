I rent a small cottage in the Heights and have lived in the Heights for the
past 8 years.  I love it for the very reasons Jeff Balke has stated.  I also
love not having to get on the freeway to drive to work every day - I used to
live in Kingwood.  I don't want to see huge townhomes built on every
available property because ten years from architectural styles will change
again and some of this new construction will appear even more ugly than it
is now.  Just my opinion.

	Well, this isn't Kingwood (thank God).  It is one thing to eliminate
	businesses that create a significant problem for traffic, noise or
whatever
	else.  It is another altogether to eliminate the existence of
businesses.

	This is a community and, by definition, requires a little bit of
everything.
	I, personally, would hate to lose places where I can walk to eat
like Java
	Java or pick up some gardening supplies like Buchanan's or shop for
some
	antiques.  Those businesses are part of the charm of the community
that is
	the Heights.  Without them, we are just another deed restricted
suburb of
	Houston.
