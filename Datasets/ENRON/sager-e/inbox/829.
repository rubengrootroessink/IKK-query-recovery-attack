FYI.

Simon is with Linklaters in London and reviewed the draft Agreement (Goldman Sachs/J Aron) from English law perspective.

Subject:	RE: Enron Email (Goldman Sachs/J Aron)

You asked me to consider whether there would be any advantage to Enron in
entering into this agreement, given the limitations we discussed yesterday.

My conclusion is that the agreement would assist Enron in the event of a
default by a member of the Goldman Sachs group and there is nothing, as a
matter of English law at least, that would make it imprudent to enter into
the agreement.

The reason why I think the agreement assists Enron is that, absent a winding
up of a counterparty under English law, the courts will generally uphold
contractual set-off arrangements. There are obvious advantages to having an
arrangement under which if one member of the Goldman Sachs group experiences
credit problems, Enron can close out all its positions at the same time and
set them off against each other. It is true that if one of the
counterparties is subject to English law winding up proceedings the set-off
will not be effective (because only "mutual" obligations can be set off
against each other and this requires two parties which are acting in the
same capacity). However, this should not affect its validity vis a vis other
counterparties and, in particular, will not affect the enforceability of the
netting provisions under the individual master agreements. Mutuality is not
required (outside a winding up) where the set-off is based on contract. The
fact that a counterparty is in administration would not prevent the set-off
from being upheld, whether as regards that counterparty or any of the
others.

I have obviously just focussed on English law. One point I note, however, is
that Section 2(c) states that any automatic termination provision in the
underlying master agreements is inapplicable. This is not a concern as a
matter of English law because automatic early termination is not required
for the netting arrangements to be enforceable. However, the position is
different in certain other jurisdictions (Germany, for example). The risk is
that this provision will affect the underlying netting arrangements as
regards counterparties incorporated in those jurisdictions.

As Paul pointed out yesterday, the fact that the multilateral netting
arrangements would not be enforceable on an insolvency means that you cannot
regard them as creating a net position for regulatory capital purposes
(although this does not affect the recognition of the netting under each
underlying agreement).

I hope this is helpful. If you would like detailed points on the agreement,
please let me know.
