Leslie and Marcus


In accordance with my earlier voicemail, attached is a copy of the
matrix that needs to be completed  for the EEI power (Marcus), WSPP
power (Leslie) and GTC power (Leslie) by Friday.  Once completed, please
email to Julia Murray.  Don't hesitate to call with any questions.
Thanks so much for the help.

	 Attached is the form of Contract Matrix which Travis prepared.
Please complete as we have discussed--- based upon the typical forms
that you are using.  Please also attach the forms of contract so that we
have them handy to refer to the exact language.  We would very much
appreciate if we could get these completed forms no later than Monday
morning.  If you can complete sooner, even better.  Thank you .   Julia
