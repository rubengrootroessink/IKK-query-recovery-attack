Attached is a suggested form of UCC1 financing statement for use with New
Power.  Note that the Tax ID numbers need to be added for the Enron parties
and we need to determine if New Power is a transmitting utility.  Assuming
New Power is largely a power marketer, we would not want to make an
affirmative election on that issue.  Do you have any views on this the facts
or this issue?

I assume that by now NPW has and is reading the documents.  They may need
turn around on these documents at a time none of us can anticipate.  Please
let us know when you get wind of the need.  We really do want to be of help.
