When McClellan came in, he was one of those big dogs, like Robin Gibbs, who=
 "has the confidence of the Board."  We shall see what happenend to him.  I=
t is a great story about chemistry and leadership. =20

I would add "dispute resolution" to the list. =20

I left off in my reading just after the Battle of Bull Run (mid-July, 1861)=
. . .so I have a few months of catching up to do. . . but I will be reading=
 along.  I will try to get current next weekend.

Now that Lincoln has fired Gen. McDowell, I am eager to read about the Linc=
oln-McClellan relationship.

Hey friends, we are rapidly approaching October, and in our communal readin=
g of Shelby Foote, October is where things pick up and go steadily forward =
for three years.  Let's dust off the big tome and read forward, month by mo=
nth together.  Elizabeth,  try not to read too much at a time,  just find w=
here he is in October of 1861 and read slowly.  This is a slow, savoring th=
ing, not a rapid read for escape and entertainment.  With this big terroris=
t mess going on and eveything, the lessons for both business and life are g=
oing to be termendous. And, one final admonition, Elizabeth, when you get i=
nto his lengthy descriptions of troop maneuverings,  try not to be bored,  =
just take a pencil and paper and kind of sketch out what you think he is sa=
ying,  the basic directions and movements...use your skills for calculating=
 early termination payments and set offs.  All of these battles are big net=
ting and set off messes.  You are better qualified than you think to get in=
to this stuff.  War is just a big messy chess game termination and  set off=
.  Try to get your imagination into it this way.   ----cgy

And, if duty calls, he would understand. . . .

There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the li=
ne would gain personal knowledge of the presence of old friends, even relat=
ives, being directly across the lines, back there in the mass of enemey tro=
ops.  The Union General Hancock had been a very close friend of the Confede=
rate General Armsted and on the eve of the final day at Gettysburg,  had a =
moment or two remembering their good old days together in California.  Wolf=
e and Krebs are out there somewhere "on the other side."  Although I must c=
andidly confess that officer Krebs does not rank high in my humble judgemen=
t and is not among the significant players in the combat,  Wolfe does.  Wol=
fe was a player.  He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to "t=
hem" and not to "us" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missin=
g a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope =
I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy=

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joini=
ng AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working o=
ut of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete ag=
reement is still in force.
