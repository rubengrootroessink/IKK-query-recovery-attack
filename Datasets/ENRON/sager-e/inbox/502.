Thanks Carol.  We are dealing with these.  I believe that Energy West is another that expires before the end of December.  I will try to give you a call tomorrow on the inter-company swaps under the services agreement, and the effect of counterparty terminations on the book.

Cheers
Greg

Peter and Greg:

We are holding LC's that expire at the end of December with respect to the  following counterparties:

EPCOR Energy Services (Alberta) Inc. ($25 million)(physical)
Engage Energy Canada LP ($!9 million)(financial)

I am assuming that you are aware of this situation and are handling it.
