Hi David:

This note appears more alarming than it is because the impact is only $6,50=
0.00 for the entire Ercot wide system according to our ERCOT client represe=
ntative in a phone conversation.  In light of this Kevin Presto wanted to g=
et ideas from the legal world of what the impact might be if the shortfall =
was 65,000,000. =20

In my reading of 9.4.4 of the protocols ERCOT would have had to go after th=
e credit line of the non-paying QSE before taking the step of reducing paym=
ent of other QSE's.

I have to assume that these steps were taken and if so, then I would have t=
o assume that the initial shortfall was greater than $6,500.00 to begin wit=
h.  If the credit lines of the offending QSE were not reached for by ERCOT =
then my question is, why not.  These steps are clearly outlined in the Prot=
ocol.

I have contacted Thane Twiggs who is in Austin now to find more facts and w=
ill let you know when I hear from him.
