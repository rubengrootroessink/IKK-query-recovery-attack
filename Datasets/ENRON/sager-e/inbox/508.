Jay:
We have received termination letters from Mirant covering the following:

1.	Letter dated 11/30 from Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP covering (a) 5/11/99 Master Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement; (b) 1/1/99 Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement; (c) 11/1/92 Master Firm Purchase and Sale Agreement; (d) GISB confirms; and (e) emission transaction confirms with ENA, ENA II Corp., EGM, EPMI, ERMS and ENA Upstream.

2.	Letter dated 11/28 from Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP covering (a) 4/1/97 Master energy Purchase and Sale Agreement; (b) 1/1/96 GISb; and (c) 6/1/94 ISDA.

3.	Letter dated 11/30 from Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. covering all transactions for the sale and purchase of natural gas.


Do these letters cover all of the Mirant relationships?  What does the collateral hat they are holding cover?  In the US, are we only out of the money on the EPMI trades?
