Noel Trask inquired when is the December 6 meeting supposed to start and
end and whether we ask business people familiar with the MISO rules to also
attend -- maybe allow each company to
bring one person if they want to?

I think it is important that we all agree how to proceed so, please advise
how all of you would like to proceed.
