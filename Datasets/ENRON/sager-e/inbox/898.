Recipients:
I also have been meeting with AEP's Into Product traders to discuss the
implications of moving to the MISO.  Conceptually what we have been
discussing is a "policy statement" of the "Best Practices" for allocating
the rights, obligations and commercial risk as between Sellers and Buyers
of existing Into Product transactions based on the current definition
contained in the EEI contract in as much the same manner under an RTO
structure as possible.  Separately from that transition product issue, but
somewhat related, is a need to define on a going-forward basis the products
sold within these emerging RTO structures on the first day of operation and
as a market rules emerge.  I will endeavor to email a draft proposal Monday
morning to this group.

I am NOT available to participate in a conference call from 2-3 PM Central
time (3-4 PM Eastern Time) on Monday.  I could do 4-5 PM Central  (5-6 PM
Eastern) on Monday.  If that is agreeable, I will set up the conference
call in number and pass code.  Please let me know.

Subject:  "Into" Products



           This is a reminder to Mitch that he is going to draft some
language for our "going forward" transactions dealing with anticipated
changes to "into" obligations.  GO MITCH GO!

           I met with our traders today and I am sure of only one thing --
it's a mess.  Mitch - if you're not ready to draft, we should maybe just
set up a conference call next week to discuss.  If so, can we do it
Monday, 11/19 between  2 p.m. and 3 p.m. (Houston time)?
