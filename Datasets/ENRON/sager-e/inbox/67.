Elizabeth -- As discussed, attached is a draft 'generator' EMSA for your review, together with the draft Credit Support Annex forming its Exhibit B. The pricing alternatives in the Exhibit A are not fully worked out yet.  I welcome any comments you may have. For purposes of comparison, attached is the draft 'extreme short form EMSA' I circulated for comment several weeks ago.  David
