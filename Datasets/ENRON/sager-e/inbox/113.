Christian, 

This reminds me of the custom where two warring tribes would make peace by each sending a group of children to live with the other tribe.  Concern for the safety of the children encouraged each side to keep the peace.

This group will report to me to enable closer coordination and integration with our Origination group and to ensure that Enron has complete and seamless coverage of the power market.
