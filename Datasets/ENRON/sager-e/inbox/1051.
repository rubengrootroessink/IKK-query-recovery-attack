The events in the Underlying Master Agreements that should be excluded from the definition of an event of default that would trigger an Underlying Master Agreements Close-Out are as follows:

(i) the unexcused failure of a party to deliver a specified quantity of a commodity;

(ii)  a change in the extent to which a party is regulated; and 

(iii) events described in Section 3(f) ("Default under Relevant Transaction") and 3(g) ("Material Adverse Change") of the GT&C for the sale and purchase for Flat UK Beach Trades.

In addition, all third party debt cross default thresholds in the UMAs should be revised to be $100,000,000.

Also, please incorporate the language regarding the Commodity Exchange Act provided in the e-mail attached below.

Please forward a copy of the draft to me, Lech, and all of the addresses cc'd above.

Thanks,

Regarding the commodity law issue, we suggest the following language:

"The rights of the Parties under Sections 3, 4 and 7 of this Agreement are
subject to, and qualified by, the applicable provisions of the Commodity
Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq., and the rules and regulations
thereunder."

This could be new section or, perhaps, folded into existing boilerplate.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
