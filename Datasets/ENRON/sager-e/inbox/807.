Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on eve=
nts, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to b=
e unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management t=
hing.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of=
 the back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed t=
o offset a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  t=
his prototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a v=
ery high quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlemen=
t processes in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue fina=
ncial sorcery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenan=
igans  seems to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficu=
lt to isolate and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad gu=
y and firing him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of cor=
ruption seems to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasing=
ly likely, a takeover from without.   ----cgy =20
