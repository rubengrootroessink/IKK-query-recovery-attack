Forwarded per my voicemail, so that you can ride herd on this with Bill. AEP's revised draft adds in a multitude of affiliates (including European ones -introducing enforceability questions) and puts forward a Par. 8 'adequate assurances' text.  The attorney contacting me before forwarding this draft said that AEP's Frank Hilton and Bill Bradford were discussing this mutation of the arrangement.  Please come back to Elizabeth or me with questions/comments.  --David
