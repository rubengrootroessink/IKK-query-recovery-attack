This is air purifier I was talking about. It is pretty quiet and 
pretty nice looking plus easy to change out filters. Hope Sam is better.. Thanks again for the visit.. It really helped me make it
through the insanity of that job which , by the way, went really 
well despite the unnecessary distractions on site!!
