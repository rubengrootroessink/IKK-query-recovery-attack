Hello Elizabeth -- sorry to have missed your calls today but was wondering
of you might be available to call-in to tomorrow's meeting for the
discussion on standardizing Master energy contract provisions.  This is
where will launch the working group but I thought it would be helpful to
give folks some background first.  Hoping you might be able to do this
tomorrow.  Also wondering if you would be able to forward me a copy of your
table on Standard Documentation for OTC Commodity Trading in North America
so that I may be able to circulate to the committee.  Attached is the agenda
(with a new call-in number).  Many thanks!   -- Stacy
