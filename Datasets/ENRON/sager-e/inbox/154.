You forgot the small reminder on the festival Friday.  Must have been all
the football excitment at the end there.  Anyway, the Houstonian carinval
thing is Sunday October 28 from 4-6 pm.  They request RSVPs at 713-685-6888
(although I'm sure they'd let you come anyway).  There is also a "costume
party" for the bigger kids one of those nights.   If Ella and Sam were
going I'm sure Eleanor would love to go (Alice is too young).   I think it
might be on that Friday or Saturday night (there is info. in the MDO on
it).   Have a good week.
