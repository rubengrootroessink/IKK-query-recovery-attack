If, at it now appears is the case, that Rosman, Choi and Malowney shift over to report to Calger, we are soon going to have legal resource allocation political risk.  We need to talk to Elizabeth about hedging this risk soon.----cgy

Christian, 

This reminds me of the custom where two warring tribes would make peace by each sending a group of children to live with the other tribe.  Concern for the safety of the children encouraged each side to keep the peace.

The Middle Market Group will continue to focus on commodity marketing throughout the WSCC under the leadership of Stewart Rosman, Paul Choi and John Malowney.  This group will report to me to enable closer coordination and integration with our Origination group and to ensure that Enron has complete and seamless coverage of the power market.   Chris Foster will continue to lead our growing services business and report to Tim.  

Please join me in congratulating Jim, Chris and John on their new roles.
