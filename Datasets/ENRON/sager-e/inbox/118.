The consensus of the group is to hold our meeting in  Washington on November 12.  We'll meet from 10-4.  John Crespo  has graciously offered to host the meeting at Hess'  offices in Alexandria,  Va. located at:
 
Amerada Hess Corporation

Alexandria, VA  22314 
phone:  (703) 317-2321

Their offices are about 10 minutes from National Airport by  cab;  1/4 mile from the Washington Metro stop at Eisenhower Avenue;  and next to the D.C. Beltway.  John has information about nearby  hotels.  Please let John and me know if you can attend.  Also,  let us know if you are interested in getting together for dinner  on Sunday night.  We'll organize something for those who want to get  together.
