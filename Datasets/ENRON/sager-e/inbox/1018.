SuperModels=20
Why Enron investors are running for the exits=20
It's all about risk -- and the Houston energy company may be on the hook fo=
r billions. Bailing now and taking $5 a share, sellers reason, is better th=
an getting only pennies in bankruptcy.=20
By Jon D. Markman <http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/bios.asp>=20

In normal circumstances, shares of Houston energy-trading titan Enron shoul=
d have stabilized around $10 after it agreed to a merger with crosstown riv=
al Dynegy earlier this month. Instead, the stock price is retreating faster=
 than the Taliban. Why?=20

The answer, like everything associated with Enron, is complex. But the shor=
t version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merge=
r and force Enron to seek bankruptcy protection, potentially leaving its sh=
ares worth pennies.

While attention has so far focused on credit problems related to ill-disclo=
sed limited partnerships, institutional investors are increasingly worried =
about risks Enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as "s=
waps." Accentuating their concern: Billions of dollars' worth of Enron's ne=
ar-term swap contracts -- instruments that ironically were invented to help=
 corporations limit risk -- will reportedly mature next month and are even =
more hidden from investors' view than the deals that have gotten the firm i=
nto trouble so far. On Wednesday afternoon, the bond-rating agency Fitch up=
dated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed "there have been signific=
ant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess o=
f previous expectations."=20

Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of independent debt-research firm CreditSig=
hts and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros., said the swaps marke=
t is a very large but arcane investment arena that isn't followed by mainst=
ream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts. Yet, he noted, "it's one o=
f the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron."

How much is Enron on the hook for?
Swaps exposure thus makes December a make-or-break month for the company, a=
s its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borro=
wed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate a=
s currency, natural gas, bonds and metals. If Enron either made the wrong b=
ets on too many of these deals, or contract covenants are breached that spu=
r demands for hard-asset or cash collateral, the company could be forced to=
 seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling =
treasury.

Moreover, because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous -- wi=
th Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligation=
s to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C - some trader=
s worry that Enron's potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilitie=
s could threaten the stability of the world's commodity-trading system.=20

No one is saying that this worst-case scenario is bound to happen. But rumo=
rs of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets --=
 even if they're never proved true. One story making the rounds on trading =
floors, for instance, tied the historic collapse of U.S. government bonds i=
n the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quan=
tities of short-term Treasury notes to make good on swap-related margin cal=
ls. (Enron officials did not return calls for comment.)

Experts noted that Enron's counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high =
levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Lon=
g-Term Capital Management in 1998, which imperiled the world capital market=
s until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout. That debacle ended when on=
ce-generous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot. Said =
one veteran portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified: "This is sha=
ping up to be LTCM 2. If Enron's lines of credit dry up, they're out of bus=
iness -- end of story."

Lots of credit and lots of deals
To understand the problem more clearly it's important to understand what En=
ron does for a living, and the role and utility of swaps.=20

Many investors think of Enron as an energy company or gas utility, but it h=
as really operated more like a combination investment bank, market maker an=
d hedge fund in the past few years. One of the key ways it earned income wa=
s its role in selling risk-management instruments -- those swaps -- as a so=
lution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over.=20

Let's say you run the risk-management operation of a metal-mining firm and =
you're long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices m=
ight fall in six months. You want to lock in the price, so you enter into a=
 swap with Enron under rules of the International Swap Dealers Agreement, o=
r ISDA. Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance =
sheet, so it's not disclosed anywhere for competitors, or investors, to mon=
itor. One of Enron's roles was to find a company with the opposite problem =
to yours -- let's say they want to be short copper futures -- and make the =
match. Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a =
risk that you felt you could control.=20

More often, Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by =
using some other hedge, such as being long or short Eurodollars or U.S. Tre=
asury notes. It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for=
 actually delivering the physical product. At its peak, Enron is said to ha=
ve been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week.

This business requires massive amounts of credit -- also known as "leverage=
" -- because margins are slim; the only way to become super-successful is t=
o do really big volume. It turned out that few of Long-Term Credit Manageme=
nt's counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leve=
raged itself by as much as 30:1 because of similar efforts to trade in high=
 volume. And likewise, one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified t=
old me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an as=
tronomical 100:1 in some cases.

Thomas Seims, chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an autho=
rity on swaps, told me that the crux of the issue is, "Do we know exactly w=
hat their positions are -- and did they use swaps and leverage properly or =
improperly? When we find out, we can determine the potential for a contagio=
n effect."=20

The big question: How many deals?
Why don't we know what their positions are? Legally, they're not required t=
o reveal them -- and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terr=
ible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment comm=
unity conventions actually require. Swaps are similar to the proprietary tr=
ading operation of major brokerages, but with one critical difference. Typi=
cally stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much. But =
swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthin=
ess of the counterparties. So for all anyone outside of Houston knows, ther=
e could be any number of billion-dollar deals hanging out there with rules =
that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rati=
ng falls below a certain rating threshold, such as BBB-, one step above jun=
k. The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited =
partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enron's stock to =
plunge 20% on Tuesday, according to traders.=20

More importantly, one financial services executive pointed out, because Enr=
on owns the market for many swaps, spread options and other thinly traded f=
inancial instruments, they're the ones who set the mark-to-market price tha=
t shows on their profit-and-loss statement. For example, every night an Enr=
on trader must mark the value of a 15-year Chicago natural-gas swap on his =
books. There is no closing or settlement price -- there's only what the Enr=
on trader thinks the price should be. It is in these mark-to-market prices =
of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds=
 of millions in unrealized losses, if it chose to.=20

One prominent New York consultant to the energy risk-management industry to=
ld me he's estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much $1 bil=
lion or more in failures related to its swap transactions. Why hasn't anyon=
e focused on it? "The magnitude of Enron's partnership problems is so great=
 that after awhile you get numb, and no one is paying attention to this par=
t of their operation."

Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading energy-industry economist and consultant,=
 also noted that one reason that Enron risks aren't easily quantified is th=
at they "may not be price independent." That's an economist's way of pointi=
ng out that the company -- a major player in a corner of the derivatives bu=
siness called "delta hedging" -- may not have the capital required to maint=
ain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity produc=
ers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil=
 might fall or rise sharply. If prices maintain above or below a level that=
 Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction, no proble=
m. But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly -- as oil prices did =
earlier this month -- then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and for=
ced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation.

Whirlwind merger deal no reassurance
Verleger isn't mollified by the notion that Dynegy, which agreed to merge w=
ith Enron, has studied the company's trading book thoroughly and decided it=
 was fine. "Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week," =
he said. Added another trader, who declined to be identified: "How anyone c=
ould do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely." Another trader sp=
eculated that auditors at Dynegy -- a much smaller firm -- may have initial=
ly given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered on=
e of the cleverest and best-connected companies in the nation, with a chief=
 executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George =
W. Bush.

Reynolds, the CreditSights executive, said that investors should beware wha=
t he calls "omission risk" -- or the simple fact that "what you don't see i=
s what gets you every time." He points out, for instance, that Enron had a =
chance to tell investors about its ratings-related exposure in the Brazilia=
n deal during a conference call with investors last week, but didn't. "It b=
oggles the mind" that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild co=
nfidence and credibility, he said.

So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet? Reynolds believes that Dyn=
egy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk=
 away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults -- called "fails" i=
n the business -- emerge. He believes that Enron would then find it necessa=
ry to seek the protection of bankruptcy court, because no other merger part=
ner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegy's footsteps to the altar.

In that event, Reynolds estimates Enron's stock -- which traded for $85 a y=
ear ago -- could quickly sink to less than $2 from its current perch in the=
 mid-single digits. Since holders of more than 80 bonds and senior bank loa=
ns would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings, however, he=
 speculated that Enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies.=
