Lisa,

I am comfortable that the order setting the administrative claim bar date applies only to claims arising from the post-petition sale of power through the CAISO.  My understanding, based on an email from John, is that power sales under bilateral contracts, such as the EPMI power contract, do not go through the ISO.  Assuming that is correct (and if John or Elizabeth disagree, please let me know immediately), I am comfortable that there is no need to file an administrative claim for power sales under the EPMI contract for the period April 6 to April 9.

Similarly, the post-petition negative CTC claim does not arise from the sale of power through the ISO.  Thus, there is no need to file an administrative claim for it at this time.

Ben
