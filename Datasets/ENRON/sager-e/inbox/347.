THE PLAN!

The upcoming November 12th general meeting will be a special occasion.
Businesses who share your concern for continually improving our
community
join the Houston Heights Association.  Their dues, sponsorship  and
active
participation help us make our neighborhood the unique and inviting
place
we all enjoy.

Our November meeting will showcase the many area retailers that add
convenience and quality to our daily lives.  The theme of the program is

"Holiday Shopping in the Heights".  There is a wealth of marvellous
shopping opportunities right here under our noses in the Heights.

As a typical male, shopping is not real high on my list of life's
pleasures. Don't get me wrong.  I love giving gifts.  It just the
"getting
them" part that I get stuck on.  While cost is a factor, it is not the
biggest issue.  The idea of just zipping right down the street and
picking
a nice gift up does have a great deal of appeal.  Saves gas.  Saves
valuable "golf" time.  Gives me a chance to say hello to a few friends.
The big shopping stickler remains "What to get for who and where?"  What
I
need is "The Plan"!

Well Happy Holidays! Merchants from the Heights have already done the
all
the leg work for us.  They have put together "The Plan".  They have a
shopper's paradise of information that answers many of those age old
questions like:
Where can I shop in the Heights that does gift wrapping too?
What the "in" gift to give my 8 year old niece?
What an alternative to giving my significant other yet another kitchen
appliance this year?
What is a nice gift for Granny this year?
Can you give me a map of how to get to the participating stores along
with
their holiday hours?
What merchants offer special Holiday discounts for being an HHA member?
What is the best way to get gifts shipped from the Heights and what are
my
deadlines?
Where are the best places in the Heights to buy Holiday decorations and
what are some new approaches?

As our nation reaffirms it's believes and values this Holiday season,
few
are more important than the strength of our community.  This holiday
season
make a pledge to do your shopping close to home - right here in the
Houston
Heights.  Buy from that business owner that also is your friend,
neighbor
and member of the Houston Heights Association.

See you at the fire station starting at 7 PM on Monday November 12th.
Then
see you just down the street at that unique Houston Heights shop buying
that one of a kind gift for that special someone.  - Mike Easley
