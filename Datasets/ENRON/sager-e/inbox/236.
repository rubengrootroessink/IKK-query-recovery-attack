Hello Brownie Families,
Below is an e-mail from our local Girl Scout council.  It provides links and
suggestions about discussing the recent terrorism with children.  I pass it
on as a potential resource for you.  There are also ideas for ways we might
provide service to help out.
Joy Lee

> This is from Council.
> +++++++++++
> Dear members of the Girl Scout family:
>
>  Thank you for all of your thoughts and prayers for our sister Girl Scouts
> and fellow Americans in New York and Washington, D.C.  The Council has
> received a number of calls from troop leaders and parents seeking advice
>  on how to work with the girls in the Girl Scout setting related to the
> terrorism coverage. Many leaders are interested in identifying service
> projects as well.  We have asked the national organization for guidance on
> projects we can adopt that can support the relief efforts and healing
> process.  We will let you know if there is a national project adopted.  In
> the meantime, there are things you can do in this community to help the
> girls be pro-active, such as:
>
> 1  Make thank you cards for your local firefighters, police officers,  and
> medical professionals.
> 2  Bake and take cookies to firefighters and police officers.
> 3  Donate stuffed animals to fire stations.
>  4  Learn about local blood banks and the importance of donating blood
> year-round.
>
>  We will continue to post ideas to the Council web site - www.gssjc.org.
> Continue to check the web site for more information.  If you have an idea,
> let us hear about it.
>
>  The following e-mail was received by the Council from the United Way of
> the Texas Gulf Coast and is an excellent guide and reference for working
> with children during this time:

>
>
>  Today's events will certainly be in news for quite some time, and many of
> our lives may be disrupted in different ways for a long time.  As many of
us
> watch the news and talk to others about the days events, our children will
> certainly notice that something is going on.
>
>  Parents may want to talk with older children about the days events and
what
> it might mean, but young children (under the age of 7 or 8) may be
disturbed
> by witnessing scenes of destruction on television or by listening in on
> adult conversations.  It may not be unusual if some young children react
by
> being more clinging, seeming a bit more concerned, or having difficulty at
> bedtime.
>
>  Although it might be important to allow older children to participate in
> viewing and talking about the news, it might be wise to limit young
> children's exposure to TV news.
>
>  It is important that young children be reassured about their own safety
and
> the safety of their parents and loved ones. Subtle changes in parent's
moods
> and behaviors can have an affect on children especially if they witness
> reactions in their parents that they have not seen before.
>
>  Be prepared to spend extra time with children if necessary, and continue
> normal routines and activities.  Use the opportunity to explain how and
why
> people are reacting the way they are.
>
>  In the days that come, we may be witness to preparations for retaliation
> (or at least threats of retaliation).  Certain groups of people may be
> identified as terrorists. It will be a challenge for all of us to remind
> ourselves and our children that we value peace.
