Elizabeth --The changes by AEP are on the 6th page, Par. 8 and second last paragraph.  I've called Dave Musselman to say we would accept those, and that I understood from Louise Kitchens that the Collateral Threshold number on page 2 should be $190M -- he's waiting on feedback from Frank Hilton in their credit group.   I told him if they accepted the $190M number then AEP should fill it in, sign the document and fax it here for countersignature and dispatch of our wire.  I gave him my fax no. (713-646-3491) but said if AEP had been provided a different fax no. by the Enron Credit group, he should use that one as well.  -David
