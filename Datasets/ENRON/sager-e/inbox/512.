Attached please find a spreadsheet that describes the prepays we completed this week.  In summary, we bought power supplies through December 31 from Allegheny, AEP, Avista, Idacorp, and PNM and delivered to over 15 in the money contracts.  The power cost approximately $3.3MM and will generate a post-petition receivable in excess of $12MM.  Next week we will identify the January schedule and recommended purchases/deliveries.  Apologies for any wiring firedrills.

Regards,

Chris
