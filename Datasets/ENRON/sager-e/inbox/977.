=09Molly:

=09Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursu=
ant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of =
the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's "Supplier Select" program, credit appraisals and security requ=
irements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted "as financial evaluatio=
ns dictate". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective Aug=
ust 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amo=
unt of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor =
is at the minimum rating (listed as "BBB" from S&P or Fitch or "Baa2" from =
Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, F=
itch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guara=
ntor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii)=
 the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York=
 utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely =
payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit ra=
ting is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement wi=
ll be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2. =20

=09In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security=
 requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutual=
ly agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash depos=
it which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved=
 by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond =
issued by a financial institution with at least an "A" bond rating; (iii) a=
 security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a g=
uarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit r=
ating of at least "BBB" by S&P or Fitch or "Baa2" by Moody's; (v) payments =
made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which wi=
ll reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be requi=
red); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adeq=
uate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your informatio=
n, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) a=
fter providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails t=
o pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within =
the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy=
 (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier=
) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its custom=
ers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. =
186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

=09Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional info=
rmation.
