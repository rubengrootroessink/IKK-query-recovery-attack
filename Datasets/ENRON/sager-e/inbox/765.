Re power receivables facility:

The following are the counterparties designated in the draft Master Netting Agreement under negotiation with AEP, which could be executed as soon as [late] this afternoon.  All other power trading affiliates of Enron and AEP, if any, are intended to be excluded from the agreement, though this is still under discussion.  Please contact Elizabeth Sager or me with any questions. 

AEP ENERGY SERVICES, INC.
