I am sorely tempted to venture into remarks that would be unbecoming of the professional ethics I am sworn to uphold.  This is like being in the Oregon State penitentiary and finding out the prisoner down the cell block is a child molester.  The regular inmates have ways of dealing with this particular kind of specie. Every morning,  our whole reason for walking into the building that houses the business establishment we toil for  is about not letting our business hubris get out of legal and ethical control, and now, we see this.  One of our own crossed the line, a line that seems so dark and vivid now, but which, in the back rooms full of   illusions of omnipotence, and what one's imagination is constrained to not crystalize as the image of literal dope smoking,  seemed to be such an insignificant little technicality.  This is a dark and wretched day for our profession. ---cgy

Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, a lawyer for an Enron division. The company ``now believes'' Glisan, Mourdant and two other employees no longer working for Enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
