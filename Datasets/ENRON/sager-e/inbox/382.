Elizabeth,

Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving-weekend.  Just wanted to follow-up on my messages on your voice mail re. our call with VEPCO and subsequently, with Kevin.  It seems that there might be some agreement with VEPCO with regards to moving to an hourly index.  Kevin said he needed to hear from you and the higher-ups that our potential exposure resulting from audits was something we needed to address, and he would then take the resulting positions on his books (without being penalized over potential MTM downside).

Please give me a call when you have a moment so I can fill you in, and we can discuss the feedback we need to provide internally and to VEPCO (they're expecting something by tomorrow - Tuesday, 11/27/01)

Please feel free to call me at any time.

Regards,
Rahil
