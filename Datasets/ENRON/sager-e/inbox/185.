I received info from CSC showing a balance due of $117, 205.53.  The balance shown on the EES spreadsheet shows  a claim of $117,880,00.  There is also a note in the comments section of the spreadsheet that the dollars may not be valid  since ENA might have received the money.  Also, per the comments, this was being looked into by Tanya Rohauer and there was a settlement with the customer.
