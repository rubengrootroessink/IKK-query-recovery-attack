I received info for the Spring 2002 Singles League.  League will not start
until February, but the roster and team fee have to be postmarked by Dec.
28th.  I'm leaving to go out of town on Dec. 19th, so I will need to know
before then if you are planning on playing again.  Also, we will all need to
pay our 2002 HTA membership dues ($20 for the year).  Let me know if you need
me to fax you a form.
