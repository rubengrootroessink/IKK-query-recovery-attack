Attached is MidAmerican 's response to our EEI coversheet-- not many open issues left, but several which are credit-oriented, including changes to the 'stairstep'  numbers on CSA Par 10.  I have received a call from Brian Weise today -- he said he hoped to finish this today.  Please note that we have open trades with MidAmerican, shown on the Exhibit A below, which are on long-form confirmations which in several cases are not countersigned by MidAmerican. Pleaese review the attachments  and contact me with you comments.  David

David, 
Sorry for the delay.  Here are drafts of the EEI Coversheet, Collateral Annex, and Paragraph 10 of the Collateral Annex.
The only change on the Collateral Annex is the legal name on your end.  Our contract is with "Enron Power Marketing, Inc.", not "Enron Corp."
On Paragraph 10 of the Collateral Annex, there are two changes:  First, I have adjusted the threshold amounts for Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to reflect MidAmerican's credit policy.  Second, I have indicated that MidAmerican prefers Letters of Credit as collateral and would prefer not to exchange cash.
On the Coversheet, most changes (there aren't very many) are more editorial in nature.  The substantive issues appear to be related to Section 2.4 Transaction Terms and Conditions, Section 6.2 Timeliness of Payment, and the new section pertaining to Confirmation of EOL Transactions.
On Attachment A, I have also referenced a specific Schedule P product (Into Cinergy, Seller's Daily Choice)for the pre-existing transactions.
I think that we can resolve the remaining issues in a phone call and would like to do so as soon as possible (even today if that works).  
Please let me know if this will be possible. 
Thank you, 
Brian Wiese
