Joel/Elizabeth - thank you for the information yesterday.  As it is critical to the analysis here in Canada (i.e. it is materially different if the contracts are terminated prior to ECCs filing),  please let me know if you are aware or become aware of the point in time that:

1. Enron Corp. becomes/became insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they come due; and/or
2. there has/had occurred a default or other event relating to indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $100MM, which results in such indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable or capable of being declared immediately due and payable.

Thanks
Chris
