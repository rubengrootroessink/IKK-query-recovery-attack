Joel you are right, PG&E accounted for 3,340,000/167,000,000 th's of ASCC's interest in the receivables.

According to the monthly settlement report for September, PG&E Corporation had a balance of $8,676,000 for physical gas receivables, a concentration limit of $3,340,000 and an excess concentration limit of $5,336,000 -- I assume that the amount reflected in the concentration limit was included in determining ASCC's ownership interest in the pool of receivables, and that the assumption below is incorrect.

I assume, unless I hear from Joel or Tim to the contrary, that none of the PGE Entities receivables were included in the referenced financing, and therefore, the financing does not relate to the master netting agreement between the PGE Entities and various Enron entities.

At this time no further master netting agreements should be implemented without coordination with Ephross on these issues in respect of the inclusion of physical gas contracts.
