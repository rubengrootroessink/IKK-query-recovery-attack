Yes, I liked him a lot.  I wish he were more conveniently located, and that
he was on my insurance network.  I've got to go out of network if I keep
seeing him.  I have a pediatrician close by and I like her, but she's new
out of her residency and doesn't know as much as Injac does.  He had a lot
more information to give me on several items I had talked to her about.
Where are you going?  Vacation, I hope.
Connor has mommyitis.  He doesn't want me to ever leave him - and it's too
restrictive.  Our 2 day a week nanny went on vacation for 2 weeks and now
he's upset if she has him.  How quickly they change.  I guess that's the
good news also.
My phone # is 832-358-1543 (they wouldn't give me a 713 number, to my
surprise).  Oh well, there are worse things than having a difficult phone
number.
See you soon maybe.
Kathy
