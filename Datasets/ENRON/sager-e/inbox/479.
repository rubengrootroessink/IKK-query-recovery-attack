This is an example of the type of invoice that could possibly create issues for Newco, if Enron is an owner is some fashion.  To my knowledge, we are not paying these unless there is an Enron physical position that we are continuing pending a sale.  While Newco may or may not be responsible for Enron's debts, the fact that the other regional members will have to pick up these costs could, at the least, make a new quick membership somewhat difficult (we may ultimately be right, but they could raise a stink in the meantime).  I don't know if the bankruptcy attorneys/Newco bank attorneys have looked into this.  Let me know how we can help.

We have received invoices from MAIN region for 2002 assessment.  I do not know of any Enron positions that would warrant us making payment.  However, let me know.
