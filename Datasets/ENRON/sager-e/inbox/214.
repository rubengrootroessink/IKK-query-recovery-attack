Elizabeth, Julia, Mark, Jeff, and JoAnne,

Per the discussion with Alan Aronowitz and Nony Flores to include Global Markets in the project, they have decline due to time constraint in gathering requirements.  However, if they decide otherwise, they can be added during the elaboration phase.  

In going forward, I will need approval from you all to begin the project.  Instead of a written signature for the Statement of Work - Trading Agreements Project, send me your approval via email.  Please copy Betty Broadfoot when sending your approval.

 

Thanks,

Sher? Luong
