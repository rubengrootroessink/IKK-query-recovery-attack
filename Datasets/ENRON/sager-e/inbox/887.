	This is a reminder to Mitch that he is going to draft some
language for our "going forward" transactions dealing with anticipated
changes to "into" obligations.  GO MITCH GO!

	I met with our traders today and I am sure of only one thing --
it's a mess.  Mitch - if you're not ready to draft, we should maybe just
set up a conference call next week to discuss.  If so, can we do it
Monday, 11/19 between  2 p.m. and 3 p.m. (Houston time)?
