If you are driving to the meeting, please park in the spaces in front of the
building and the building opposite our building (near the traffic circle on
the west side of our building) that are labeled as guest parking for 2800
Eisenhower Avenue.  You will need to get a guest parking pass from the guard
at the front desk.  If the guard is not there, please let me or the
receptionist know, and we will make sure the pass gets taken care of.  --JCC

An agenda for the Nov. 12 Meeting.  It looks like dinner won't happen, but
Ed said he'd buy drinks Monday night.
