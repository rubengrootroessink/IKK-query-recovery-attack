If you are planning to attend the December 6, 2001 Drafting Committee
meeting here in Columbus, Ohio and have not already made your hotel
reservations please do so as soon as possible in order to get the discount
AEP rate.  Their discount rate for AEP is $92 per night plus tax.
Apparently, they only have so many rooms with the discount rate.   The
hotel is Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown, 35 W. Spring St., Columbus, Ohio
43215, (614) 228-3200.  I will be checking other hotels in the area to find
out about discount rates and forward to you the information.

Please forward any names of individuals that you know will be attending the
meeting who are not listed.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you,

DJ Stephens, (614) 324-6843
Assistant to F. Mitchell Dutton
