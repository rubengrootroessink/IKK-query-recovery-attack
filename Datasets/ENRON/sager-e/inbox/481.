Dear Jeff and Mike:

The deadline to respond to the People's Gas motion for relief from the
automatic stay is 4:00 p.m. this Wednesday -- I left a message for you
earlier, Jeff, but I write to ask you and Mike whether the company has
taken a position on whether it will agree to the relief from stay motions.
The response to National Gas is not due until 5:00 p.m. on December 24th,
but it would be good to go ahead and get an idea of what will be required
for the response.  I have a rough draft of a stipulation.  Jeff, shall I
forward that to you?
Best regards,
Jayne South
