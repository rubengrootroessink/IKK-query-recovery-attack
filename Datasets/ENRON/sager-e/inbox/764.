I will be at an EEI meeting in Dallas on November 9 to discuss the  NERC/EISB/GISB issues.  I believe that Dede Russo will be there as well.  
My basic position re the EEI contract is that there are many other  standardization issues that EISB should focus on first.  If you don't  agree, please let me know. 
 
Is anyone else from our group, or any of your colleagues, plannning to  attend?  If so, please let me know. .
