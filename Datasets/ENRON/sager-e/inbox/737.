     We are considering including the attached provision (or something)
similar in our Transaction Confirmations.  I would also like to propose it
to EEI and WSPP for sample language that could be included on confirms.
Would any of you have a problem agreeing to this?  If so, what are your
concerns?  I know you are all real busy right now and appreciate your
consideration of this matter.

     Thanks in advance.
