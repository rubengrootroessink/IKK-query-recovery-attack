Marcus,

New Power wants to close out their gas hedge positions.  Under which Enron entity were these financial deals confirmed.  It probably makes sense to have them execute the opposite trades within the same legal entity to improve netting rights and cap exposure by entity.

Please advise so I can inform the EES trading desk and ENA trading desk of how to proceed.

Bill

The 6 financial gas confirms have been returned to us, signed by New Power. I have not heard whether we have received all the physical gas confirms yet and we are still trying to find out what financial power deals were concluded.
