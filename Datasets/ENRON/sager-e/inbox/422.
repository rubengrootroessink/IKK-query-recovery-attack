To those still on the list serv for the Houston Heights Association - my
apologies for the barrage of emails that you have received over the deed
restriction note from Monday night.

The list serv was set-up so that you could receive messages about
community news and events.  It was not intended to be used as a chat
line.  All postings to the list serv email address -
announcements@houstonheights.org - have been closed, accept for message
from me, the webmaster (assuming I have reconfigured it correctly).

Any future announcements will go back to it;s original intended use.
Thank you for your patience and again, my apologies.

Debbie Markey, HHA webmaster
