Subject: Update to Merger Q&A

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.
