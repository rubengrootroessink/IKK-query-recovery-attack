Rhonda and Alice:
Could you ask someone else in the power group to handle this?  I am swamped with EBS stuff and can't get to it.  Thanks.

Here's the deal on this one.  This deal is part of the deals assigned to Morgan Stanley.  This index deal has delivery in 2001 (never exercised) and 2002 (may be exercised).  As Sharen indicated in her email, we are reconfirming (confirming to Morgan) all forward parts of the deals assigned.  This confirm was prepared by Steve Wang without benefit of legal review.  We need legal to review this new confirm.  It looks just like the old one but without the 2001 part in it, but there may be language that Steve put in it that could cause heartburn, maybe.  We are just unsure of the language since legal did not prepare the confirm and it is not standard boilerplate confirmation language.
