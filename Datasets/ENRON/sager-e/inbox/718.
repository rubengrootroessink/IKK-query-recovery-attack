There is a direct analogy to the Civil War here.  Soon after the Union bega=
n to lose with much embarrassment in the field, a Committee For Overseeing =
the Conduct of the War comprised of big angry guys from Congress was formed=
, I'm not sure how.  I think they just kind of announced that they were for=
med.  They began interviewing people and were quite viscious about their co=
nclusions, if I recall correctly, they gave themselves the power to jail pe=
ople. Lincoln endured them and eventually they atrophied, but this kind of =
 savage second guessing and vigilante  vengance by elected legislators is d=
efinitely a theme of politics.  The notion that Dunn is seeking to keep thi=
ngs quiet to prevent rumors is total bullshit.  If I were one of those poor=
 saps being interviewed, I would get a lawyer and scream bloody murder abou=
t due process.  Dunn can only do harm with this tactic, and again, it shows=
 that the pathology of the body politic in Californicatia has advanced to i=
ts most florid degree.  These people are sick.  ----cgy =20

California state senator Joe Dunn is conducting a secret McCarthyesque inqu=
isition of ISO Board members in an apparent effort to find a scapegoat to s=
oak up the political blame for the energy crisis and divert negative critic=
ism from Davis.  Dunn better pick up the pace, the March primary election i=

Energy probe kept under wraps: In secret, a Capitol panel is deposing key p=
layers in the lifting of a power price cap.
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Oct. 30, 2001)=20
A legislative committee is taking secret depositions of energy officials in=
 a highly unusual effort to shed light on events that some believe triggere=
d California's energy crisis almost a year ago.=20
The depositions, whose format was spelled out in a Senate resolution in Jul=
y, represent a first for any state Legislature in the United States, accord=
ing to Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. Dunn, a lawyer who chairs the Senate Sel=
ect Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Mar=
ket, is taking most of the depositions.=20
Dunn said the secrecy is meant to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming pu=
blic.=20
"We're trying to do this investigation in a thorough and professional fashi=
on," he said. "I'm not interested in tarnishing anybody or any company with=
 information that doesn't turn out to be true."=20
But some think the secrecy is unwarranted and makes the testimony prone to =
manipulation.=20
"My concern is that if we have secret depositions and the committee starts =
issuing reports, the full context of what was said or talked about does not=
 come to true light," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Inde=
pendent Energy Producers, a trade association representing independent ener=
gy facilities and power marketers. Smutny-Jones, the former board chairman =
of the state's electrical grid operator, is scheduled to testify in early N=
ovember.=20
Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside, voted against the July resolution that laid t=
he groundwork for the depositions and still has misgivings about the proces=
s.=20
"Whenever you have politicians doing an investigation like that, there's a =
risk that the investigation turns into a circus, especially when it's done =
in secret," Haynes said.=20
Secrecy could allow people to "play hide and seek" with the testimony, he s=
aid, releasing only those parts that support one theory. It could also allo=
w the witnesses to attack the committee's findings by arguing that the whol=
e story wasn't told.=20
"Over time, it hurts them," Haynes said.=20
All 16 subpoenas issued by Dunn's committee went to current or former board=
 members or staff of the Independent System Operator.=20
If those called on to give testimony want it public, Dunn said, he would gr=
ant the request. So far, no one has asked.=20
What some energy officials really want, Dunn said, is access to other depos=
itions.=20
"We're not going to give folks the opportunity to compare stories," he said=
. "There's no reason they need to see what other people said."=20
The grid operator would prefer the testimony to be open, said spokeswoman S=
tephanie McCorkle. As of Monday, Dunn had not informed the Independent Syst=
em Operator officials that they can choose to make their testimony public, =
she said.=20
"We think it would be a great opportunity to explain some of the complex is=
sues" the grid operator faced last December, McCorkle said.=20
The committee is focusing on events in early December 2000, when Terry Wint=
er, president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operato=
r, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift a price cap on po=
wer. The cap of $250 per megawatt-hour was replaced with a "soft cap," in w=
hich power sellers could charge more as long as they justified the higher c=
osts.=20
Winter and other managers at the grid operator had a good relationship with=
 the board and were in the habit of consulting with it, Dunn said.=20
But on Dec. 8, Winter submitted the emergency filing without letting the bo=
ard know.=20
"The ISO board was shocked at that filing," Dunn said.=20
In response to Winter's request, the normally slow-moving FERC issued an or=
der within an hour and a half. The series of events "caused a lot of people=
 to be very suspicious of what led up to that filing," Dunn said.=20
The committee is investigating whether Winter and electrical generators eng=
aged in a concerted effort to bring about the lifting of the price cap. It =
has subpoenaed documents, personal calendars, e-mails and phone records. Th=
ree or four depositions have been done, with the rest scheduled in the next=
 three weeks.=20
Some energy officials say that the theory being investigated by the Dunn co=
mmittee is fatally flawed.=20
"If that's where it's directed, I don't think it's going anywhere," Smutny-=
Jones said. "Terry was empowered to take action independently, which he did=
 do and it kept the lights on. I'm very troubled at someone trying to turn =
Terry Winter into a scapegoat."=20
The ISO board at the time was "close to totally dysfunctional," Smutny-Jone=
s said, making it reasonable for Winter to act alone. Winter's filing, and =
the FERC response, are all well-documented.=20
"There was no conspiracy, no smoking guns there," he said.=20
The FERC order, in fact, kept electricity flowing into the state and allowe=
d the grid operator to seek refunds later, McCorkle said.=20
Before the order, "there were literally no bids in our real-time market," s=
he said.=20
But Dunn said the FERC had other options, such as ordering generators to se=
ll into the California market.=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said ISO officials failed =
to notify the governor of the emergency filing, despite the fact they met w=
ith him on other matters that day.=20
"They clearly didn't want the governor to know," Maviglio said.=20
The Senate resolution says that no one can be present for the depositions e=
xcept members and staff of Dunn's committee, the person taking the depositi=
on, an official reporter, the person being deposed and his or her counsel. =
Many of the ISO officials have retained private attorneys, whose bills will=
 be paid by the grid operator, as required by the nonprofit corporation's b=
y-laws.=20
The California Constitution allows closed sessions of the Legislature and i=
ts committees only in certain cases, such as party caucuses or to discuss p=
ending litigation.=20
But Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment Coali=
tion, said open meeting provisions likely would not apply to depositions wh=
ere less than a quorum of the committee was present.=20
Dunn said only he and committee staffers have been present in the depositio=
ns taken thus far.=20
