In addition to Sandhills Enron also made a 203 filing this year in respect of the sale of the New Albany plant to Duke. You will probably need to run a check on Enron at FERC to ensure that between us we have identified any changes to the three year update for EPMI which was prepared at the beginning of this year.
	
Kind regards,
	
Marcus
