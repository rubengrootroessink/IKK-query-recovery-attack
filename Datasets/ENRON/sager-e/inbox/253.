MAPP has incorporated the EEI Master  Agreement as their membership tariff.  See attached.  They would  EEI and NEM's ok to do this since the tariff is derived from our document.   They have retained most of the core language from the EEI, but have added  various tariff related provisions and a new Schedule Q for MAPP related  products.  I'd be interested in folks feedback on this.

Hi, Andy.

Attached is the version of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool Power and
Energy Market Rate Tariff that has been sent to MAPP's Power and Market
Committee for a vote for issuance and filing at FERC.  The vote is due
August 27, 2001.

As previously discussed, I would be grateful if you would secure EEI's and
NEMA's permission to use the EEI Master Agreement as the basis for the
proposed tariff.  Please note that on the cover page of the proposed tariff
attribution to the copyright owners has been provided as requested by EEI
and NEMA.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding this matter.
