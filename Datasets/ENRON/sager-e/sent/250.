Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

Attached is a draft of a PPA/Tolling Agreement that we were negotiating last 
year in connection with the potential disposition of our 99 Peaking Assets.  
I believe you have seen this one before (in fact, I my memory serves my 
correctly you provided significant input).  I hope this is helpful.
