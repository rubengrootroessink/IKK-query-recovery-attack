As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.  This 
agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it 
to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.  Call me at 713 
853 6349 if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks
Elizabeth Sager
