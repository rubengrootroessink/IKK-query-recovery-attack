Andy

I would be happy to do product/Into discussion as well.

I'll talk to Tracy but don't think she can make it from Portland to speak.  
If you need a speaker for the credit support annex I could help or maybe 
another Houston based credit person (I'll check to see if we have any any one 
available)

I'll be out of the office on the 7th (I'm speaking at ISDA as well as eye 
surgery in am so..   but I'm sure David Portz could show you the Enron 
building. His number is 713 853 9239.

Thanks
