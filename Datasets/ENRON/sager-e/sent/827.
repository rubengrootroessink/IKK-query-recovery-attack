Subject: Re: Draft Agenda for 12/15/99 EEI/NEMA Contract Group Meeting



I've been hiding in the weeds.  Hisss.  I agree w/ Patty and Liz that product 
definition should be the primary focus of the meeting.  It would seem most of 
the transmission related issues PECO (or Dynegy) have could be addressed in 
the context of the force majeure definition and how specific product 
definitions tighten or loosen FM excuses for non-performance.

I think we can represent that discussions w/ FERC staff will take place 
during January.  Our meeting coordinator is talking w/ Mariott about roll out 
meetings in Houston during the first week of March and in NYC late 
April/early May.  Let me know if you have any scheduling conflicts during 
those timeframes and I'll circulate some proposed dates w/ the product 
definitions.  Also, let me know if you are not interested in participating in 
one of or both roll-outs.

I will gladly circulate product definitions, but will be out of town after 
the 10th.  Could you CC: Patricia Young at EEI 202/508-5757 pyoung@eei.org 
with any definitions you want circulated.

Another topic I would suggest discussing briefly  if time is available is the 
results of the contract survey.  We have received many responses. Tabulation 
of the results should be done by our meeting.

Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the agenda.
Do we have a definition of the "Into __" product that has been updated since 
the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the "Firm (LD-System
Reliability)" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there any
conceivable way we will have the time?

Thanks,

Harlan
