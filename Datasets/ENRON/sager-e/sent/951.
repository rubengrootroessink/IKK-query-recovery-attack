Elizabeth:

Per Paul Racicot's voicemail to you, please find attached a draft power 
supply agrreement between Enron and New Hampshire Electric Coop.  (Reference 
to PSEG in the message body must have been inadvertant).  Tracy Ngo ran a 
credit check on them and found they have been running a deficit, but didn't 
see that as a problem since we are purchasing non-LD unit contingent power 
from them.

We need to have comments to them by noon Eastern, 11 Am Houston time.   
Thanks very much for your help, and I'll need to swing by and introduce 
myself next time I'm down in Houston.  I can be reached today, over the 
weekend, or Monday at the following numbers:

  Office:   978-449-9936
  Home:  978-448-9260
  If neither of these work, then:
  Cell:  978-314-5614
  Pager:  877-246-3206

Regards,
John
