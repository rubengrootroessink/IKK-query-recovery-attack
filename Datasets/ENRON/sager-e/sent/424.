Kevin- I apologize for not getting back with you on this. I don't know if you 
know but I have resigned from Enron and have only a few days left. I am 
swamped with a lot of other work and I have asked my boss, Elizabeth Sager, 
to appoint a new atty to handle EOL matters (until Leslie Hansen returns).

She can be reached on x36349.

Thanks,

Shari Stack
