Thanks for your message

Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.  
Coaching seems to be his real passion.

I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are 
scrambling to find a birthday concept.

On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - 
let me know when you can.

Talk to you soon.
