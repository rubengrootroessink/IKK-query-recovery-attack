The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
Happy New Year!  The first 21st Century meeting of the Standard Contract 
Working Group will be held in Houston at Reliant Energy's offices on January 
26 from 10-4 (Central TIme).  Reliant's offices are located at 1111 
Louisiana, Houston TX.

The purpose of the meeting will be to reach final consensus on product 
definitions.  The Drafting Committee will meet next week to prepare revised 
product definitions based on the discussions at the last working group 
meeting.  If anyone has any comments or proposals about the definitions under 
discussion in December (or any new product definitions), please forward them 
to me by cob on the 11th.  Definitions prepared by the drafting committee 
will be circulated in advance of the January 26 meeting.

If you plan to attend the January 26 meeting please contact Patricia Young at 
202/508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org .
