Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there 

PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother 
who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together 
at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice 
on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs.
