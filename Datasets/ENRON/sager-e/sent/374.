Please let me know if the bios I have from your last workshop need 
updating...also, when you get a chance, let me know if you will need any 
special av equipment for your presentation.

We are planning a Speaker Dinner for the evening of March 21 in Atlanta and 
will keep you informed.

Let me know if you need anything...Tricia
