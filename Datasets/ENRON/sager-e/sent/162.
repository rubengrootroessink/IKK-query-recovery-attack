My husband, Mark, is out of town all month in trial in NYC.  We split season
tickets with a few others.  I'm not going to be using any of my Nov. seats.
Would you like tickets for any of these games (knowing that your husband at
least likes to play basketball0?

11/2 Milwaukee Bucks
11/14     Chicago Bulss
11/16     Charolette Hornets


Just let me know.  Thanks.
