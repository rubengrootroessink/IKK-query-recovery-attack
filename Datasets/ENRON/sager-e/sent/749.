Subject:  Steve Kean's testimony

Steve is giving testimony today before the US Senate Comm. on Energy and 
Natural
Resources in support of the dereg bills.  His oral testimony states that TVA 
has
refused to provide us with the same service it provides to itself.  Both the
oral and written testimony seek a new NERC, comparable treatment for native 
load
uses of the system, and "green tags" at the generator (not traced through to 
the
end user).  He will also discuss recent transmission access problems we have
encountered (new tag requirements , unannounced scheduling deadline changes, 
TLR
cuts, wrong info on the NERC redispatch page, etc.)
