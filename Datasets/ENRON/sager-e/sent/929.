Subject: March 7 Workshop



I'm attaching my proposed schedule and panel assignments for the March 7 
workshop.  I've already spoken with several of you about your assignments. 
The panel moderators should have a conference call with their panels either 
Thursday or Friday this week to discuss the timing and assignments I put in 
the schedule.  I'd be happy to participate with you.

Materials.  For most of the contract-specific panels, I think we should use 
an updated version of the slides we used in November.  I am attaching the 
original slides and updated versions I've used subsequently.  Please make any 
changes you feel are needed and FAX them to me by noon Eastern tommorow.  I 
am also attaching Fritz' flowchart (into product 2.ppt) of the Into Product A 
and Liz' hypotheticals (examples.ppt).  Liz or Fritz, in light of the latest 
changes to the Into product, do these need to change?

Anyone with separate presentations they want distributed at the workshop has 
two options:  they can email them no later than cob Thursday or, if you can't 
make that deadline, make arrangements to have 110 copies delivered to the 
conference hotel on Monday March 6.  Stapled, 3 hole punched, double sided 
copies would be preferable.

AV -  we will have a laptop, LCD, overhead and slide projector available.

Any speaker who can make it for 7 o'clock dinner at Molina's on Westheimer is 
welcome as EEI's guest.  Houston-based speakers are welcome to invite their 
colleagues to the reception.

Please contact me if you have any questions
