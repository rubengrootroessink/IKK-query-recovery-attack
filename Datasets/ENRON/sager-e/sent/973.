Hi Dede 

I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much 
help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to 
start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project.

On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) 
at lunch?  Let me know.

Hope you have fun on Friday night.
