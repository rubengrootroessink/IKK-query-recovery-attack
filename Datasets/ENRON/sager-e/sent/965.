Hello Elizabeth:

Hope all is well down in Houston.  I have attached a market based electric 
purchase/sales tariff for New England Power Company that I was hoping you 
could provide a legal review of.   I would like to have this signed to enable 
us to enter into future transactions with them.  If you are not the 
appropriate person to review this, could you suggest a more appropriate 
individual.  Thanks much.  My number is 978-449-9936.

Regards,
John
