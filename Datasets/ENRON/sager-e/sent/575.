Just checking to see if the appendices for the PG&E bankruptcy document are 
available.  If you are not the person that has these, do you know who I could 
contact?

thanks for your help

Elizabeth,

I work for Georganne and we are trying to find all the pieces in the risk 
books.  It would be very helpful if we could get the appendices that are 
mentioned in the document below.  Could you help me with this?

thanks

Can you please forward a copy of the letter we sent out Tuesday morning to 
Georgeanne Hodges so that she has all of the correct values?  Thanks.
