Hi John

Thanks for WSJ article.  Now if only you could notify senior management over 
here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as 
well).

TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you 
now.  We have to send out on Thursday.  Do you have time to review and we can 
discuss tomorrow. 

 Thanks
