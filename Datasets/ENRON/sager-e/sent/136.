Hi Dede
Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week? How about Monday 
(anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO 
language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real 
meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya.
