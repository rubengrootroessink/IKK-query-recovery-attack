Subject: Proposed WSPP Firm Power Definition





The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in
Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would 
appreciate
your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for 
use
in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be
inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:

     Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to 
an
     Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and 
power
     is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet
     Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If
     Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or
     statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages
     for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this
     Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted
     for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the
     non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this 
Agreement
     or Confirmation Agreement.
