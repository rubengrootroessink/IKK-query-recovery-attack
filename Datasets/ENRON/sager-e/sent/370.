Hi John

Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still 
far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out  
LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I 
still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it 
could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when 
I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?

I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you 
and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the 
commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works 
for you.
