I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section 
relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of 
the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an 
idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the 
right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do.
