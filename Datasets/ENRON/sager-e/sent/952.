Subject: Revised Formosa Term Sheet

Here is the Formosa Term Sheet that spells out a straight-forward tolling 
arrangement.  After further discussion, I have eliminated sharing options.  
We will use this as a starting point and if Formosa insists on a sharing 
alternative, we will address that at that point.
