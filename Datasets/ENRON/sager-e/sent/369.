We are in the process of reviewing and upgrading our pulp, paper, lumber and 
steel trading contract documentation platforms.

and Confirms for these commodities.

Please forward any comments with specific language changes to me by March 
1st.  You are invited to a meeting March 2 at 11: 00 a.m. in EB38C1 to 
discuss any proposed changes.

Please forward these templates to any one else in your group who may wish to
