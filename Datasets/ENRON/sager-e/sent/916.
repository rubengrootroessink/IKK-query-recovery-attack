Subject: Re: Draft of EPMI Response Letter to TVA  

Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several 
suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few 
words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick 
reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into 
context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use "Commercial" I suggest 
using "commercially reasonable" if that would be the ultimate standard 
applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.  Later JOE

Subject: Draft of EPMI Response Letter to TVA

At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's 
response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests.  
This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from 
Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all 
revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We 
would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this 
afternoon if possible 

Thanks
Elizabeth
