Attached for your review is a draft of the Joint Brief of Intervenors in the 
PCA
proceeding at the D.C. Circuit.  As you know, the Brief must be filed with the
Court on Friday.  Thus, to ensure that there is sufficient time to address
issues/concerns, we request that Intervenors provide comments as soon as
possible on Wednesday.  Please bear in mind that the Court has allotted
Intervenors 8,750 words and the current draft is right at that limit.  Over 
the
next day, where appropriate, we will add citations to the record, include 
other
citations such as case name short cites, and shorten quotations.  We look
forward to your comments.
