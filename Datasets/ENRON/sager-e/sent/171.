As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been 
speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based 
upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the 
way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the 
basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, 
differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and 
stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to 
advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants 
the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the 
reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a 
meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At 
that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make 
sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons 
for the differences.

Thanks
Elizabeth
