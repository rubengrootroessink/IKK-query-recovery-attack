POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled "Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.
