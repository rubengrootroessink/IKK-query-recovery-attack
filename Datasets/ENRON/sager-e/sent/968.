I,m jealous of your beautiful dog, but do you have any pictures of family?
Lunch tommorrow is out (standing in line at post office to get passport for 
trip to Paris).  Next week I'm mostly out (trip to NY with daughter Ella for 
wedding of girlfriend I've known since I was Ella's age) but call me anyway 
or I'll try to call you.
PS As you can tell, work is a low priority right now, so .... let's go!
