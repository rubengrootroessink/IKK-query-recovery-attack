 Elizabeth, I am sending you the attached consent at the request of
Janice Moore, who thought it would be best for me to contact you directly. I
have incorporated your comments--as relayed to me by Janice--into the
earlier draft.
 Please review this consent and, if you approve, lett me know by
e-mail or telephone (412...667.7900), whereupon I will prepare an original
and send it to you.
 Thank you very much.
     Steve Williams
