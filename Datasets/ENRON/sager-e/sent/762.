Subject: EEI Standardized Contract - Revised Draft



To the Drafting Committee:
Attached for your review are clean and marked copies of the
standardized contract. These documents are in Word Perfect; if you are
unable to open them, please call my secretary Sue Edwards and she can
send you a fax instead. I will be out of the office for the rest of the
day but will be back on Monday if you have any questions. In order to
keep with our mid-August deadline, please call me (312) 258-5659 or fax
me (312) 258-5600 your comments by 5 pm Chicago time on Tuesday, Aug.
10. Also, please let me know if you want to have a conference call
before this goes out to the larger group, as opposed to just reviewing
the draft one last time once I revise it with all your comments. Pleae
let me know if there is any time on Aug. 11 or Aug. 12 when you are NOT
available for a conference call.
Thanks,
Caroline
