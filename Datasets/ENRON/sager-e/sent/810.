Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes 
you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of 
November.

As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the 
definition of an "Into" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last 
EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 
430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to 
participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into 
definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I 
will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them.  

Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near.

Subject: Standardized Master Purchase and Sale Agreement



The attached Master Purchase and Sale Agreement represents the culmination of 
a tremendous effort by the Standard Contract Working Group and Drafting 
Committee.  Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of 
creating this document as possible.  Many compromises were made in creating 
this contract and  is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement.  
Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will 
benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are 
attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was 
made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting 
at EEI.

At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate 
non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it 
would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the 
mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under 
certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments 
will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in 
Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments 
to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be 
worked into the panel discussions.  Moreover, many of your colleagues from 
the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.  For 
your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.  Send your 
comments to either Patty Dondanville, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, or David 
Perlman, dmperlman@pwrsrc.com

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
