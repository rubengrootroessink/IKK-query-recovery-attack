Subject: RE: Wind Agreements




Dear Gentlemen: 

At the request of John Lamb, I am forwarding a revised version of Section 
5.04 which has been marked to show changes against the clean version of the 
file named WIND PPA 8-1-00.doc forwarded to me by Michael Payne.? Please note 
that this revised version is being sent concurrently to you and our clients 
and, as such remains subject to their comments.? 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call. 

Best regards, 
Karen?
