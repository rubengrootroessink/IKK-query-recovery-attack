Elizabeth,  Here are my comments.  Need you to add an Insurance Section.  
Also, throughout the PPA I asked you to add comments or clarify a few 
sections.  If you can add your comments today, lets meet first thing 
tommorrow to discuss (leave me a message tonight and I will come in early to 
read before we meet).  I didn't bother with the Green Sharing Agreement since 
we have not completed going through it with Wind.

Thanks, - Mike
