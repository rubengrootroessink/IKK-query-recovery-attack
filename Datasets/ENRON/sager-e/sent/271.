Hi Shari

I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need 
to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m 
and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we 
discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from 
LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates 
to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS
