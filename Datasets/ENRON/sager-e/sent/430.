Bruce and Mike:

Attached please find the most recent versions of the Frontera Energy 
Marketing Services Agreement and the companion Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Eric and Frank asked that I forward these to you.  Please be 
advised that these are still under review at TECO, but reflect the most 
recent discussions concerning this arrangement.

You will note that I have made some changes to the Master Power Purchase and 
Sale Agreement to reflect the relationship being established under the Energy 
Services Agreement and to harmonize the terms of that agreement with the 
overall business relationship being established.  Please recognize that there 
are likely to be further revisions following additional review.

I look forward to concluding this arrangement in the next several days.

Dan Sanford
