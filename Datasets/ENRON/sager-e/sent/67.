David - 

Please review the insert that Entergy provided.  They have requested that the 
Into Entergy System Border includes... "from an interface that has sufficient 
ATC posted that will allow for the purchase of Daily Network Designated 
Resources on the Entergy Transmission System."

I am ok with this b/c the def of an into product requires firm trans to be 
avail to sink into the CA (Entergy in this case).  In the event firm is not 
avail, then supplier can take LD risk associated with non-firm trans.

Entergy agreed with this interpretation.

Also, because this is a large deal for them, they need to get approval from 
higher levels.

Please provide me with some feedback as this deal is critical to my trading 
position/strategy.

Thanks,
Rogers
