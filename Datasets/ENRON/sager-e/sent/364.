Dave and Ed,

We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
comments on our standard confirms. 

Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks guys.

-Joe
