PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - 
I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it 
an""EEI Canada"?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in 
the name of the organization that "approves" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe 
you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to 
get EEI's approval/consent.
