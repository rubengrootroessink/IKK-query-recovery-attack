The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
We have decided to reschedule our Contract Working Group meeting for Friday, 
October 13 (10am-4pm) since we realized that Yom Kippur begins at sundown on 
October 8th and Columbus Day is on October 9th.

We would appreciate a response from all since we need to order lunch.

Thanks, we look forward to seeing you on October 13.
