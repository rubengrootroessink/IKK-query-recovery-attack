Jason Sherman has determined that Genia FitzGerald needs a new printer.  Her 
printer has been repaired twice and does not work now.  I have located a 
printer on IT Central for Genia.  The information is as follows:

 Hardware: Black/white personal printer HP 1100XI
 Description: 8ppm monochrome personal laser printer at 600 x 600 dpi
 Price:  $420.00

Thank you,
