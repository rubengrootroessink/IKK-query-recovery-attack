Morris--Thanks for your previous information where you said, from a tax 
standpoint, that EPMI could buy and sell power in Canada as long as the 
trading was done in Houston (or Portland).  Can the EPMI traders physically 
meet in Canada with Canadian counterparties, as long as the agreement is 
executed by EPMI in the US?

Morris/Elizabeth/Jeff -- Tom May, our new NY trader, wants to wheel power 
to/from NEPOOL or NY through Hydro Quebec Power and New Brunswick Power.  
Rhonda and I will take care of the EPMI wheeling agreements on HQ and New 
Brunswick.  Who can make sure that EPMI has the necessary export permits to 
take power out of Canada (DOE or NEB)?  Thanks.
