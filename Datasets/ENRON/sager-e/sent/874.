Attached is a re-write of Product B, based on a general agreement between
Harlan and myself.  I apologize but I had a tremendous amount of problems
with redlining, and so have sent you a document that accepted all changes.
Hopefully someone has a comparerite program.  Andy would you please
circulate this product.  I will be glad to write up a summary in plain
English if you think that would be helpful.   All errors are my
responsibility alone, not Harlan's!  Look forward to seeing you on Wed.
Marji

PS: My email was wiped out since 1/3, what time do we meet, and would you
please provide Reliant's address.  Thanks.  M.
