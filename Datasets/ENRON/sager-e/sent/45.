Elizabeth,

We have put together a short summary of the ComEd contract to be included in 
the Info Memo for the peakers.  Please take a look at the summary.  To the 
extent that we could disclose more info like counter party, capacity price, 
etc., please let me know and we will modify the summary.  Let me know if you 
have suggested changes.

Thanks,

Don
