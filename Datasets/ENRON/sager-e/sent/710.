Elizabeth asked that I request a copy of the above document at your earliest 
convenience.  She will be leaving the office around 11:00 am this morning to 
go out of town and would like to have the agreement to review.  Please let me 
know if I can be of assistance in any way (ext. 3-5438).  Thanks.
