As discussed, attached are three bid package documents reworked based on 
today's discussions.  I will be priniting several copies and heading to the 
31st floor so we can focus on any further required changes. The bid package 
would also contain the Information Memorandum and the format Confidentiality 
Agreement (redated and attached below). --David
