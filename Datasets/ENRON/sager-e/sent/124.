Shari and Elizabeth,

     We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing
implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?
