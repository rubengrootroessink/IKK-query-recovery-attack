		 Subject: Canadian Precedent Form of Master Physical Power Agreement

Please find attached for your review the most recent form of the above 
agreement, blacklined to show the changes to the previous draft distributed 
to you.  I believe that we have now settled on the form of the agreement, but 
there remain a few commercial issues which we will be resolving in the next 
week or so.  If anyone has any final comments on the form, please communicate 
them to me as soon as possible.  I would also like to have any input from Rob 
Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market 
operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office 
to provide me with the definition of "Interval Meters" that I have included 
as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and 
we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.  
Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would 
like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final 
internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can 
commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will 
be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form 
of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that 
may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in 
duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.

Thanks

Greg
