I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying 
everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to 
blame .... You are welcome as always to come by anytime to watch the tears 
(maybe you will happen upon another fine hour like when I accidentally killed 
our goldfish on Sunday) or to pick up the ladder.
