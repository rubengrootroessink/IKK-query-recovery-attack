Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please 
call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with 
John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this 
policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this 
afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial 
trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is 
written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, 
it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should 
distribute the memo.



Thanks
Elizabeth
