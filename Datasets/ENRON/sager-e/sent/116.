Hi Andy

I read through all of your Article this weekend .

 What a job!

I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic
copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to
me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk
over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.

Thanks
Elizabeth
