I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel 
while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas 
Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is 
out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend 
to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.

PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.  
Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think.
