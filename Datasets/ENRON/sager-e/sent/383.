Hi John 

You must have told CA to take a rest while you were in Florida - all was 
quiet and now my office is now clean (I didn't know what to do with my time 
so....).  Now that you are back,  I'm wondering if my peace and quiet will be 
shattered. Meanwhile,  I hope you and your family had a wonderful break.

And back to work, we are meeting on Tues morning at  900 Houston time to 
discuss block forward trades - do you think you can participate?  If not, no 
big deal.  Talk to you soon.
