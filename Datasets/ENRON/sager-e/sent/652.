Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in 
speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I 
think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good 
opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and 
on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input.
