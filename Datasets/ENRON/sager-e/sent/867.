Greg

Original email that was sent to me, also was suppose to be sent to  you, but 
it went to the wrong Greg Woulfe.  So here it is.    

Also, date of filing is wrong.  We want to file this Friday, the 21st.

Let me know if you have any thoughts/changes.

Thanks

Elizabeth

Richard, I have attached a draft petition in the Calpine matter for your
review. Our preliminary assessment is that the probability of a successful
outcome is low. I am doing further research and will call you tomorrow to
discuss this matter. Thanks. Laura
