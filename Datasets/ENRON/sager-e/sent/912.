As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised 
Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised 
section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more 
user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during 
the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable 
due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better 
success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to 
you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.

The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those 
resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:

1.  Changed  the Section entitled "Performance Assurance" to "Collateral 
Threshold" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other 
sections dealing with collateral.

2. Added the words "acceptable to Party ___" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) 
in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the 
security must be acceptable to the receiving party.

3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the 
options are "Applicable" or "Not Applicable".

As always thanks for your help.
