Sarah--Sheila Tweed needs to see this for the peakers.

Sheila--Can you check this attached update for the peaker information?  I am 
reviewing it too.

Adam:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the Wind companies?  
Christi:  Will you be in charge of this filing on behalf of the peakers, or 
should we include someone from that group in the process as well.

Mary:  This should include all the people who need to be involved.  Also, EES 
has a section 203 application pending before FERC now to acquire PG&E Energy 
Services.  I want to wait to file this tariff with FERC until we get FERC 
approval on the PG&E ES application (we hope to get FERC authorization by 
mid-June).

I've forwarded this to Jay Dudley, Vicki Sharp, Paul Kaufman, and Dennis 
Benevides.  Who else needs to be in the loop on this?
