Hi Shari,

Christian asked me to review these inc/dec examples.  I think these are an 
excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in 
understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec 
pricing.

I made some corrections to the examples, which I have attached as a redline 
document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a 
few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean 
version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document.

Steve

Dear Bob- 

Elizabeth has put together a set of examples to help our counterparties 
better understand Inc and Dec Pricing. Would you please look through these 
and let me know if this all correct from your view point? 

If you could let me know by Wed. morning - that would be great. I have a lot 
of pressure to get this out to counterparties ASAP. 

Thank you !

Shari
