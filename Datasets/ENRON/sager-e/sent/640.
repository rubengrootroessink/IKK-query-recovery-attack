Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?
