Thanks for your voice mail.  In case you are wondering what my former 
secretary and long time friend thinks of me .... This goes with a bigger 
story I will tell you about sometime when I can.  Talk to you later.

this made me think of you...


  All in good humor:
  A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost.  He reduced
altitude and spotted a woman below.  He descended a bit more and shouted,
"Excuse me, can you help me?  I promised a friend I would meet him an hour
ago, but I don't know where I am."
  The woman below replied, "You are in a hot air balloon
hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground.  You are between 40 and 41
degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude."
  "You must be an engineer," said the balloonist.
  "I am," replied the woman.  "How did you know?"
  "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is
technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information,
and the fact is I am still lost.  Frankly, you've not been much help so
far."
  The woman below responded, "You must be a manager."  "I am,"
replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are
going.  You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air.
You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to
solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you
were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault."
