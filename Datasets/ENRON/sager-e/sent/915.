We have scheduled the kick-off meeting for the Commercial Practices 
collaborative effort.  Attached is the agenda, invitees, and cover letter.  
We have already spoken to some of these companies to gauge their interest.  
Marcia is sending out letters today.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Jeff
