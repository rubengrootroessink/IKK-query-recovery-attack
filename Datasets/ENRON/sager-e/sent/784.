Genia 

Can you get with Ed Hearn on this and start the process rolling - I think he 
was the one that set up Enron SE - if not give me a call.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Subject: Midwest Control Area Company

As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants 
as control areas in ECAR and MAIN, respectively, it is necessary to create a 
special purpose corporation.  As you may recall, we formed Enron-SE Corp. as 
the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp. 
would be the entity where the ECAR and MAIN control areas would reside.  
Please proceed immediately to create this new corporation.

Felicia,
In addition to ordering letterhead for Enron-SE Corp., please also order 
corporate letterhead for Enron-MW Corp.
