Elizabeth:

The attached list is a follow up to our discussion (i.e., IPALCO's problem 
contract) on existing customer contracts and mid-market's initiative to 
dramatically ramp up short term deal flow. This list represents 
counter-parties we anticipate transacting with frequently. Please advise as 
to problem areas.

Thanks.
