Subject: Duke Info

David,  Sorry I had to jump off our conversation earlier, I had a guy on the 
other line that I having been trying to catch for a while.   I will meet you 
up at Elizabeth's office  at 3:30pm to talk.  Attached is the e-mail proposal 
I recently sent Duke.  Other verbal understandings that have been exchanged 
are:

1.  Duke would be allowed 50 starts per year (June through May each year).  
Each start after 50/yr will have a $1500 per start charge.
2.  Duke gets 1 start per day

Duke has asked for Force Majeure and Availability language, so I guess we 
need to write up a standard PPA contract with all the standard language to 
provide them.  Kevin Presto has provided me the following information on how 
we want to proceed with the Availability issue:

Monthly Availability Calc. = MWHs delivered by Seller(in Month) / MWHs 
Scheduled by Buyer (in Month)

Base Payment = 100% of Demand Payment (Availability = 93% to 95%)

Penalty Payment = 1% bonus for every 1% Availability above 95%
Bonus Payment = 1% penalty for every 1% Availability below 93%

Note: Force Majeure is excluded from Availability Calc. if < 90 days

Thanks for your assistance.  Give me a call if you have any questions, - Mike
