Hi

Thanks for the good news - It pleases me to know end to be creating EEI 
babies throughout the world - bandwidth is also using it. Hooray
Brenda should have sent a presentation I did that summarizes EEI - Hope its 
helpful;avoid the DISASTER - it only applies in the US.
Also, Andy's article may be helpful.

Have a great weekend.
