Subject: Draft of EPMI Response Letter to TVA

At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's 
response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests.  
This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from 
Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all 
revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We 
would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this 
afternoon if possible 

Thanks
Elizabeth
