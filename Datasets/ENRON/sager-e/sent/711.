Comments on the draft.

The language in 3.1 and 3.4 should be enough to show control of the 
generator's running status by EPMI (which has been delegated to Enron -SE 
Corp. for control area responsibility purposes).

In 3.8, Yes, EPMI would need to schedule the gas and electricity.  Please add 
"EPMI is responsible for scheduling any necessary transportation to the Gas 
Delivery Point and transmission from the Energy Delivery Point."

5.2  Change "energy" to "power"

12.1 As you discussed with Sam, this agreement would have to be filed at FERC.
