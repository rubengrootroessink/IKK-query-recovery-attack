Elizabeth:  PG&E cannot accept the added language as you have presented it;
as you well appreciate, it arguably would have the effect of diminishing
PG&E's current rights.  I have accepted your changes and provided a revision
that I think more fairly preserves each party's status quo rights.  Please
keep in mind that PG&E already is agreeing to a modification of the LC
drawing events as an accommodation to Enron.  In light of that and of our
need to cooperate and move forward, I hope you can leave things as they
appear in this revision.  I'll try to call you tomorrow to confirm.  And,
thanks for attending to this.  Larry

In accordance with my voice mail, here is a revised standstill that
incorporates the concept I referred to in my voice mail.  Please give me a
call after you've had a chance to review.

Thanks

Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the
agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659;
dwa@pge.com).  By the way, we seem to have stalled a bit on finalizing the
stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one
remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs.
Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry

Hi Larry


I spoke with Peter Keohane and Mark Powell from our Canadian office and
they would be available at any time today, Tues the 8th , to go over the
Canadian Gas Master between ECC and PG&E.  Let me know what time works for
you.

Thanks
