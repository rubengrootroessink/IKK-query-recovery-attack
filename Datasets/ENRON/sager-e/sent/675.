 HI Pamela

Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it 
turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from 
speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - 
hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.

Elizabeth
