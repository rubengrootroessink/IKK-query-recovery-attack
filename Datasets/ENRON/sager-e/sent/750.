Subject: Listing of Mission Critical counterparties for Power Y2K contract 
review

Elizabeth and David,

Mike Robison asked that I send you a listing of the counterparties that the 
Y2K team has classified as Mission Critical in order to perform a review of 
the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project.  
The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I 
have them sorted by commodity so you can look for power.  Please note that 
there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission 
Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing 
and these are listed on the sheet labeled "Tier 2".  There is a power list on 
that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please 
leave me a message as I will be out of the office starting tomorrow through 
Monday, July 27.  I will be checking messages while I am out on vacation.




In addition, I am attaching the spreadsheet that we used to capture the 
results of our analysis of Houston gas contracts so you can see the format to 
use.
