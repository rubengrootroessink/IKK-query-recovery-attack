Attached is the lastest redline and clean PPA.  This along with the GPSA will 
be provided to AA for their MTM review.  Hopefully this will result in a 
favorable review and we can move to close.  Michael, I will contact you 
regarding the timing of when we should hear back from AA.

Thanks, - Mike
