I've attempted to draft language for the "CAISO Schedule Adjustment"
definition, as we discussed yesterday.  We can discuss this proposed
language in our call tomorrow:

"CAISO Schedule Adjustment" means a schedule change implemented by the CAISO
on a schedule coordinator-schedule coordinator transaction after the CAISO's
final hourly scheduling deadline for the transaction, and on which
transaction the CAISO imposes Inc and Dec Prices.  Such schedule change
shall neither be caused by, nor within the control of, either Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CAISO Schedule Adjustment shall not be
deemed to occur if the schedule change is due to (i) the curtailment of
imports into, or exports from, California; (ii) load deviations; (iii) the
failure of a Party to accurately submit or balance its schedule with the
CAISO.
