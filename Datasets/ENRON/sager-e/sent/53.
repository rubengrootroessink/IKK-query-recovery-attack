Hi Carol

My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call 
any time.  

This heat is unbelievable. I've become weak in body and have recently only 
played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first 
time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.  Just FYI  I will be out of town 
next weekend but around after that.  Anytime you want to play, just give me a 
call.

Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme 
volatility in Western power prices,  I can think of nothing more pleasant 
then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), 
luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.  Go Davenport.  Lets 
hope Martina fares as well.

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Elizabeth
