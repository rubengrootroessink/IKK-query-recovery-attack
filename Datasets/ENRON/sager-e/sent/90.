Liz,
 I've thought over the things we discussed this morning in my performance 
review and am concerned that my next review may be impacted.  I therefore 
feel it is very important for me to take a proactive role in order to assure 
that I will receive a good review from you and my other assignments at the 
end of the year.  Since I want to perform my job in a way that is totally 
satisfactory to all of my assignments, I would like to suggest you and I meet 
once a week between now and the end of the year to discuss any issues 
regarding my performance and regarding my work product  that has been brought 
to your attention.  I also plan to periodically discuss my performance with 
the other attorneys I am assigned to.  I feel that by staying completely on 
top of the situation, I will greatly improve my working relationship with you 
and my other assignments.  

 If you have any other suggestions that would be of help to me, I certainly 
would appreciate your immediate input.
