I understand that the procedure for getting a flat screen is to request, 
possibly plead, although not confirmed, with your supervisor and if he/she 
agrees, to send a copy of the email to Janette Elbertson, who will then 
permit the release of a flat screen to such poor wretched individuals.
 
Following the above procedure, please could I have a flat screen? At the 
moment I have borrowed one as the procedure stalled at the first hurdle last 
time due to "masterly inaction".
 
 
Marcus
