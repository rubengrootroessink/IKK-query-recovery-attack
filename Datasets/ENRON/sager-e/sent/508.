		 Subject: Presentations


To all:

I've put together a slide presentation that can be used for the 10am (Let's 
Make a Deal), 11:15 (When the Deal Does Not Go Down); 1:30 (Show Me the 
Money); and 2:30 (Major Meltdowns) panels.  Please feel free to edit, 
supplement, comment or suggest alternatives.  I am assuming that Harlan and 
Elizabeth will have other handouts for the 8:30am panel.  Mike Small's 
handout is attached.  I also plan to add:  the model tariff and service 
agreement, slides concerning the EEI contract development process, a page 
showing the location of the eei contract website, and list of upcoming 
activities.  Please let me know if there is anything else you think should be 
added as a handout (preferably something that does not need to be created 
from scratch).

Patty, in addition to the attached slides, Bob Viola said he was comfortable 
with using John Varholy's presentation, but wants to discuss further.  I've 
asked Marvin Goldstein if he intends to use his forward contract and 
bankruptcy memo for his presentation.   Its attached.  Shari Stack said she 
will finish up her presentation and send it to you  today.  Contact info for 
your panels:  Bob Viola 617-912-6256 (rviola@edisonmission.com); Marvin 
Goldstein 212-806-5629 (mgoldstein@stoock.com); Mike Small 202-393-1200 
(small@wrightlaw.com); and Shari Stack 713-207-5233 
(shari_stack@reliantenergy.com) .  If you need Marvin's hotel number I can 
try and get it, he's on vacation this week.  He did not return a message I 
left yesterday.  David has a conference call scheduled for Friday for his 
panels and hopefully, you can set one up for yours this week.

Looking forward to speaking w/ you this week.
