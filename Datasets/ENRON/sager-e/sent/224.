At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

To All:

Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for consideration 
by the drafting committee and interested working group participants.  If you 
provide your comments to me, I'll circulate them.  Bill is willing to have a

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy
