Please disregard the previous memo on the Time Keeping Requirements.

In preparation for SAP implementation on July 1, 2000, please send a copy of 
your time sheets each pay period to Mark Haedicke, your immediate 
supervisor,  and myself.  I will be auditing  your time records to ensure 
proper coding for the SAP implementation.  Please begin this time-keeping 
practice immediately and continue until further notification.  Thanks for 
your cooperation with this.
