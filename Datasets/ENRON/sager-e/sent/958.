I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the 
armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport 
only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard 
floors) .

Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.

Sad I am.
