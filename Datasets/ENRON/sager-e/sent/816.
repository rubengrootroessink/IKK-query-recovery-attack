Subject: SERVICE SCHEDULE C



I've rewritten Schedule C as I think we would like to see it.  This draft
defines firm power as we're used to seeing it in the East, and places a
separate requirement on one of the parties to provide minimum operating
reserves.  I wasn't sure who should be the default provider of the reserves;
however, I'm inclined to think it should be the Buyer.  Please take a look
at the attached document and let me know if you have any comments.  I
haven't circulated this to anyone else yet, and probably won't until I hear
back from you.  Thanks to all of you.

Happy Thanksgiving!
