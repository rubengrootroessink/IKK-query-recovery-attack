Attached is a preliminary draft of the Legal Risk Chart.  You will need to 
open this in "Read Only mode"

Richard and Jeff - 

As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several 
of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need 
to be updated or to be completed. I believe Julia and Mark T would be the 
best to provide updated information on the SEC Risk and the CFTC Risk , 
respectively, and I will get with them shortly to update.  This document has 
limited access; only my assistant, Brenda Whitehead can view/revise.  
Accordingly, Jeff and Richard - please either call me to discuss your 
comments and I can complete the chart with Brenda or else provide Brenda with 
your written comments.  Thanks for your help.
