Hi Phil
Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000 with 
the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are invited 
with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more leisurely 
morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them home. If we 
were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.  Let me know what you 
would like.  thanks
