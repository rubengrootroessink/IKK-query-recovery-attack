> We concur with Enron's and AEP's comments, except as follows:
>
> 1.Interest should be payable on cash collateral held each month and upon
> return of the collateral.
> 2. 15 days to expiry should be the trigger on LC's so that if the LC does
> not auto renew, the pledgee can draw down on the LC when the expiry is
> within 15 days.
