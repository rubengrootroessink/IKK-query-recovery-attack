Please look at this proposal.

If adopted, it will likely shut down trading at hubs and the hourly market 
this summer!

Subject: Into product redraft

Attached is a revision of the Into product definition and  a blackline 
showing changes from the January 10 draft circulated to the working group.  I 
now tend to regard the last sentence of each of  3C, 3D, 4A as overkill, or 
capable of being shortened, so I will look at this with fresh eyes as time 
permits on Monday Jan.17th.  Let me know any thoughts you have.  Before 
sending this redraft to the working group we will want to show it to Dana.
