fyi - we have right to terminate EEMC power positions assumed by EPMI and 
have been letting them know that we might exercise this termination right if  
they don't help us on the collateral issues.

Lisa and Bill:

Despite all of our hard work, 5 pm central is 45 minutes away.  We would
like the forbearance letter extended.  I repeat our request for an
"evergreen" forbearane (i.e., forbearance continues in effect, subject to
termination on one days notice), but in any event need a sufficient number
of days to keep the momentum going forward.  Please confirm by return e-mail
your response, with faxed copies of reissued letters to follow immediately.

With respect to the Netting Agreement, I am reviewing, and need to talk to
Lisa.

Per my voice mail, in addition to other changes we are discussing, I would
like to modify PG&E Affiliate and Enron Afiliate to mean affiliates who are
party to an Underlying Master Agreement, and expressly recognize that PG&E
Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation is not a PG&E Affiliate.  These
additions are shown blacklined in the first attachment to this e-mail.
Also,
add to signature block of the Netting Agreement and to the coverage of the
Guarantee our affiliate CEG Energy Options Inc.   Thanks, Peter
