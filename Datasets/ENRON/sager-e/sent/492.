Elizabeth,

As I said in my voice mail message, attached below are the LOI, Power Supply 
Term Sheet, and QSE Term Sheet for Green Mountain Power.  Also attached is 
the QSE Services Agreement that we are using with New Power Company.  I have 
accepted all changes made by David Portz and Michelle Parks and rejected the 
changes made by New Power Company.

Thanks,
Chris
