I made the following changes to these hypotheticals as I understand the 
changes made to the product:

Example #1

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is 
sinking in Cinergy.


Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, 
LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can 
receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require 
Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each 
party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to 
reschedule to another delivery point.

Ex #2

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases 
Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.

Ex #3

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes 
of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  
Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E.


There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't 
know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.

Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.
