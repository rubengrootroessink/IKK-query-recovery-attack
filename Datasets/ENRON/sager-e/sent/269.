So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is 
fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she 
wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would 
likely give her some barbiesque items  for the reasons you stated (she's 
going to get them from somebody someday).
