Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the 
Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the 
open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the 
right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go 
ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be 
fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing.
