Ms. Sager,

The printer that was originally recommended by the IT technician for Genia 
FitzGerald is not capable of handling her printouts.  He has determined that 
she needs a larger printer and he recommends the following:

 Black/white Network Printer HP 4100N in the amount of $1,503.00

If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette 
Elbertson.


Thank you,
Martha Keesler
