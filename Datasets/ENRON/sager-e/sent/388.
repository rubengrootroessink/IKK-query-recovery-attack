Hi Andy

I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I 
would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do 
products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.

PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and 
reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have 
met during this process.
