Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to 
talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET 
but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the 
regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will 
call you back.
