Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship 
between TVA transmission and marketing.  N

 I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make 
offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any 
way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.

Talk to you soon.

Thanks

ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated, 
then TVA control area saying it will not retag when EPMI changes the source 
(from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an 
upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with 
something.

Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not 
or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy 
or sell at its border?  Thanks.
