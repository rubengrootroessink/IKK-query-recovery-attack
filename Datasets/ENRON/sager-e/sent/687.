Subject:  Collateral Annex Activities



As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion
draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, 
may
send me comments on the intial draft prepared by Bill McCoy last winter by 
JUNE
6.  Enron's discussion draft will then be prepared based on comments received
and circulated for further discussion.

The collateral group agreed to meet in Houston on July 31.  I would like to
schedule the Drafting Committee meeting either on the 7/30 or 8/1.
