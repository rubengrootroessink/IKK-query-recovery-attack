I can also ask Randy Rich at B&P.  He does alot for Becky Cantrell and will 
probably know off the top of his head.  Let me know!

First, on the Control area services agreement, (1) Add "Area" after Control 
in the title  (2) 2nd line-- should be "EPMI to ESE" instead of "EPMI and 
ESE".    Also, Whalley will be "                        "  (I'm checking what 
his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial 
it).

Second,  the LT purchase agreement that was filed at FERC between EPMI and 
SCC was a power purchase agreement.  The new agreement is a tolling agreement 
whereby EPMI delivers gas to Brownsville Power.  Would EPMI transport the gas 
on the pipeline?  or would ECT?  Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and 
asked me if I knew whether EPMI could buy natural gas or transport natural 
gas  (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).  I 
told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular 
deal she was working on would be structured with EPMI, so not to look into 
this.  Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.  I also have 
not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).  I thought that Becky 
Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.  If you want me to 
check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.  I can also 
ask Sam B. who may know right away.  (I have not worked on the gas marketing 
side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)

I had a thought this morning.  The three plants are fueled with gas.  GENCO 
buys the gas from ECT, and then transports it to the plant.  Is there any 
FERC reporting requirements related to the gas transactions?

Thanks,
Laurel
