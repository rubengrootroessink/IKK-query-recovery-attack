Tennis plan looks great.  Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.  No problem.  I 
played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've 
ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some 
respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues 
to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here 
is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.

Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left 
me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll 
resend.  Just let me know. Thanks
