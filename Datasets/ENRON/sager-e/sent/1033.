 Hi John

Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual 
interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call.  
On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to 
let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.  
Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.

Talk to you soon.

Hope all is well.

Elizabeth
