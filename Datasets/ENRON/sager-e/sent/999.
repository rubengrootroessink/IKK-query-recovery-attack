Sometime on Wed, Thurs. next week would be fine to get together (I'm out 
early next week doing the last of the roadshows on the Edison contract - I 
can't wait for the process to be over - it has been going on for over a year).

Call my assiatant Brenda Whitehead at 35438 to schedule a time.

Thanks
Elizabeth
