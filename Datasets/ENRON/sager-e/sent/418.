		 Subject: Cinergy and Enron Transaction



 Attached is a draft of the three party agreement between PGET, Enron
and Cinergy.  My understanding is that it is with respect to 75 MWh and I
have drafted it accordingly.  I have used the format which we and Enron have
previously used.

 In addition to your review of the Agreement generally, I need
specifically a copy of the two confirms for the Enron/PGET transactions
being terminated and I need to know the settlement payment.  Also, the
appropriate reference to the existing Enron/Cinergy needs to be included.
What will be the effective date for the assignment/termination?  I know we
want to sign this tomorrow, but how quickly can it be implemented.

 Please forward internally within your organization as necessary to
complete this transaction.

 Elizabeth and Jeff, please call me as soon as possible.
