Michael:

The Electric Power Board has authorized NES to participate in TVA's
Wholesale to Market Test Program.  Due to the specific requirements of the
TVA program, NES has determined that it is in NES' best interests to enter
into standardized agreements with power suppliers.  To that end, NES has
prepared the attached document as a contract draft for your consideration.
Please contact Eugene Ward, General Counsel, or Laura Smith, Attorney, at
(615) 747-3701 to discuss the agreement.

Thanks.

Laura Smith
