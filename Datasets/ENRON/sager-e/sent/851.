Jim,
I wanted to confirm that you had received the copy of the NDA that I sent
12/29.

Tomorrow (Wed. 1/5) will be the last day that I am in the office and
available to interact with your legal guys before our meeting on 1/7.  I
will assume, if I have not heard from Enron before 1/6, that the agreement
is acceptable as sent and that we can execute the document when I arrive on
Friday.

Regards,
Trent
