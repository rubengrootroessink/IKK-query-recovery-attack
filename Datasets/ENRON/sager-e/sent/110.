Working Group Members:

The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master 
Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The 
general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is 
sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of 
version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to 
cover the following at the October 13 meeting :

GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number 
one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the 
marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status 
of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract 
that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider 
acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of 
holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues 
such as establsihing credit thresholds.

STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed 
in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental 
provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee 
identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional 
supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with 
a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being 
governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for 
electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) 
treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional 
products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to 
agency relationships; (7) "regulatory out" provisions; and (8) provisions 
involving "one-way" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases 
only.

The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop 
these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting 
committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI 
website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will 
also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general 
terms.


PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will 
discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One 
suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI 
website.

As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or 
need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.
