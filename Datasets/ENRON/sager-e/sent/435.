My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.  A trusted 
companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet "O's", he looking for 
food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' 
voices began.  

Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month 
feels.  Hopefully this to will pass.


Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.







ps - Great work on WAPA;  I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR 
will close.   I hear Skilling told Portland that he loves trading and 
promises resources.  Oh my.
