Dede Russo plans to prepare a presentation on the optional provisions that 
were assigned to members of the drafting committee last October.  Other than 
the CAISO Firm Energy and Patty's arbitation provisoin, we have not received  
additional language.  Dede is going to put together a handout by next 
Tuesday, if she does not receive any provisions from those listed below, she 
will use Reliant's language.  It would be presented for illustrative 
purposes, but could sway the audience.  Here is your chance to get your 
organization's preferred provisions out at the conference.  So, send your 
draft provisions to me and Dede by cob on Friday 3/16 please.  For those who 
may have forgotten, these are the assignments:

Prior Transactions:  Liz
Unilateral Contract:  MartyJo (sucessor in interest to Buddy Broussard)
New Taxes:  Fritz
Reg Out:  Randy/John
New Products:  Dede will handle this
Collateral Annex:  will be a separate panel
Electronic Transactions:  Babak
Agency:  No one assigned
