Elizabeth and David, have you had a chance to get back with Bonnie's
assistant who is trying to schedule a meeting this week to work on your
affidavits in response to Calpine's motion for summary judgment? We are
trying to meet this Thursday 4/12. Will you either call Lee Carrier at
853-6612 or respond to me by e-mail regarding your availability? As our
response is due on 4/20, I would appreciate your earliest response. Thanks
very much. Laura Gibson
