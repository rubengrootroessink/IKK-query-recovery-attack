Subject: Contract Standardization Meeting



As you know, the next meeting for the Wholesale Electric Contract 
Standardization Group will be held this Friday, May 7, on the 4th floor of 
EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W. from 9:30 a.m. * 3:30 p.m.  
Attached are the agenda and draft contract for discussion at the meeting.  If 
you plan to attend and have not already done so, please fax back to 
202/508-5673 the form sent to you on April 13, or respond to this message by 
using your e-mail program's "ReplyTo" function.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please call Kathy Seaman at 202/508-5757.

Those still planning to reply to the book-out survey may send their responses 
directly to Caroline Goodson at cgoodson@schiffhardin.com for summarization.  
Should you have confidentiality concerns, you may send them to EEI at 
kSeaman@eei.org; we will then strip out any identifying material to ensure 
anonymity and forward them to Caroline.

We hope that the subcommittee groups will be able to report the results of 
their efforts so that we can devote time to these issues at the meeting.  
Please pay particular attention to anything in the contract that's bracketed, 
as these will be major areas of focus at the meeting.
