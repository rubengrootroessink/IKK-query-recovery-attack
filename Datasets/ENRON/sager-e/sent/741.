Good morning, Elizabeth.

I thought I would send you the comments and suggested revisions I put
together when I reviewed the proposed master agreement.  Hopefully we can
shorten the negotiation process this way.
I look forward to hearing from you when you've had a chance to look this
over.

Geoff Mathews
