Dear Elizabeth:

     How are you?  You still owe me one for missing my panel last October!
We've been doing some work for EBS, which has been very interesting.

     We have a client that is interested in trading SO2 and NOX allowances 
with
you guys.  I would appreciate it if you would send me copies of the agreements
you use so I can forward them to our client.  Thanks.

     Regards, Paul
