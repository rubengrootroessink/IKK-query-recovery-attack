All:

I received an RFP from Northeast Utilities for sale of peaking plant 
entitlements to which I would like to respond (respose due Fri 5/12).  A 
requirement for any transaction coming out of this process is that the 
winning buyer must be signed on to NU's Tariff 7 (mkt based rate tariff).  Do 
any of you know whether or not we are already signed on to this?  If not, 
would one of you be able to review this tariff (attached) to see if there are 
any problems with it?  Thanks.

John
