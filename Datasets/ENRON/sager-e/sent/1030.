No one will be audited at this time but I just wanted to see if the agreement 
would be acceptable to us in the future.

Attached is the audit confidentiality agreement we used in our audit process
last year.  As I mentioned, it did have legal review by several of the audit
team member companies, and all of our team members signed it.  Hope it
helps.
