Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; 
only my "enemies" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I 
spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 
degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch 
up this week.

Hope all is well for you.

Elizabeth
