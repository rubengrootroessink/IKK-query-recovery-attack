To all the patient participants:

    Attached is a copy of the finalized and approved ERCOT Wholesale
Enabling Agreement.  The copyright application is pending but I know of
no reason not to use it before the approximate 6 months it will take to
obtain the copyright.  In any case, as you all know, this agreement was
created by a committee of ERCOT members and their attorneys.  It is a
voluntary instrument and may be used by anyone choosing to do so (even
non ERCOT members).  It is not required to be used by any ERCOT member
or anyone choosing to do business within ERCOT.  It may be modified by
attaching an Exhibit "E."  ERCOT disclaims any liability through use of
the agreement and as reflected in the disclaimer on page one of the
Agreement.

    Please call me with any questions.  Good luck to you all. I enjoyed
working with you on this project.

Margaret
