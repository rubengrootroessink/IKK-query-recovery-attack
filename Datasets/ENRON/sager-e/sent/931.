I've added today's comments to remainder of contract, including Patty's 
latest comments on Sch P and have renamed the file .  I plan to ship this to 
Fritz in the morning so his people can do the formatting and return it for 
our shipment to Houston tomorrow night.  You prompt comments would be 
appreciated.
