Dear Elizabeth,

Attached is the invitation to speak at "Measuring, managing and
modelling credit risk". If you have any problems opening the file please get 
in touch. I have suggested talk 5 in the pre-conference seminar, however, 
talk 3 is also available. I would be more than happy for you or your 
colleague to speak on either or both of these subjects. I am unfortunately 
working to a very tight schedule so if you could let me know ASAP if you 
could speak I would very much appreciate it.

Many Thanks
Helen Evans



Many Thanks
