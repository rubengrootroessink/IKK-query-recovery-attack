There is an internal political risk that if we send out this letter the way 
it is written, Legal will be blamed for terminating a lucrative trading 
relationship.  I would like to manage this risk by putting back into the 
letter a bunch of self serving nonesense that will make it easier for the CRC 
guy to show the letter to his boss, while still getting our bottom line legal 
point across.    Please help me think this out carefully.----cgy
