Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms 
Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I 
was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.  I'm working on insurance 
coverage now.  My appointment at MD Anderson may conflict - can you make it 
if I can't?
