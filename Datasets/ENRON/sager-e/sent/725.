Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''
