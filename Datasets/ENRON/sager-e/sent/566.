Attached is ENA legal's general posting for assistant positions - let Molly 
know if you want to make any changes.  I have not yet spoken with Molly but 
would like to move forward with hiring an assistant asap.  Molly said she had 
some candidates so .... Also, if you know anyone who may be interested, 
please let Molly know.  Hopefully we can start interviewing early next week.  

Thanks
