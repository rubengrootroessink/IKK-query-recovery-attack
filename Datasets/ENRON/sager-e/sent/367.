Elizabeth:

I am writing to follow-up on ISDA's Energy and Developing Products
conference in Houston on March 6th, 2001.  As you know, Harlan Murphy and
Dede Russo will join you on the discussion of the Use of a Single Master
Agreement for Physical and Financial Trading.  Will you contact Harlan and
Dede to discuss materials for conference or should I arrange a conference
call?  Let me know either way.

Thanks,
Liz
