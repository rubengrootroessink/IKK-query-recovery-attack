For those of you planning to attend the Power Marketing Workshop in Newport 
Beach on April 18-19, rooms at the Four Seasons are no longer available at 
the conference rate.  I suggest you try the Marriott ($199-$219 per night) 
949/640-4000 or the Hyatt Newporter ($275 per night - $99 govt. rate) 
949/729-1234.  Both are close to the Four Seasons.  The Four Seasons - 
949/759-0808 - may have some rooms available for the night of April 18 at 
their regular rate.  Looking forward to seeing you in California.
