Hi Andy
I received this email but for some reason I can't open it.  Today is my last 
day in the office until the 22nd.  Can you resend this to me and I will look 
at it when I get back next week.  If it can't wait that long, go ahead and 
send to David Portz and he may be able to assist you.
Look forward to talking to you soon.
Elizabeth
