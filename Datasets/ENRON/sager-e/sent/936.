This is an updated version of the main contract panels slide show.  I've 
already sent this to Houston  to be copied for the conference binders.  All 
slide shows received  as of today were also sent for copying.  Thanks Joe 
Hopf, David Portz, & Randy Baker.   If you want to provide supplemental 
material to hand out make sure its delivered to the Marriott by Monday night.

I'll be traveling Monday morning and will be in Houston around 12pm.   Again, 
anyone who wishes to join us for dinner Monday night at Molina's around 7pm 
is welcome.  My cell phone number is 301-213-0288.
