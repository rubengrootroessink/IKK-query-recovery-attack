Regulatory made some changes to the power description and Awais wanted 
Legal's sign off again and needs a response by tomorrow.  Will that be a 
problem?

Tana,

here is a revised marked up document that has come from Maureen Mcvicker in 
regulatory with amendments to the original US West Power document made by 
Mary Hain, regultory director in Portland.

Can we get a very quick legal approval of this please.  I would be most 
grateful for a reply by end of tomorrow please with as few changes as 
possible. 

I have already got re-approval from the commercial group and the amednments 
are more editorial.

Thanks

Awais
