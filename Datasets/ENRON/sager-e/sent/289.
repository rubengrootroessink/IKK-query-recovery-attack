Janice,

Another high priority deal.  The attached proposal is for Western Resources 
in order to cover a short position we have in SPP.  Noone will sell us FLD so 
we are agreeing to a system firm deal with one catch.  Western Resources will 
put in reserve 20-25% of the total deal value in an account.  They will then 
reimburse us  up to the amount in reserve, if they cut us.  I have tried to 
lay out as muck detail in the attachment as possible.  This deal would need 
to be closed by Jan 1.  Let me know if we need to meet on this and I will get 
someone from the desk to come along.  I will call you to follow up on this.  
Thanks.

-Joe
