Subject: Revised NSP Summer 2000 Confirmations

As discussed, attached are the three revised, redlined confirmations dated 
today and showing changes to price terms agreed with NSP today, for 
circulation to NSP . 

Please note that the presence of indexed pricing tied to a monthly average 
may in certain circumstances slow down a party's calculation and invoicing of 
liquidated damages payable under Confirmation 3.   Also note that, if the 
terms of the 3 confirmations are accepted, the "draft" and "not an offer" 
notations will need to be deleted from the top of each page.

Please call me with any questions. --David
