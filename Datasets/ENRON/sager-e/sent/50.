I believe Leslie is out for two weeks.  Could you check with Elizabeth Sagar 
to confirm?  Look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

I've looked at the website, and I think that it's a fit for the Floating 
Price language. Leslie - do you agree?

We are trying to set a meeting to discuss testing for 3:00 pm tomorrow. I 
will let you know how that discussion goes.

Hi Dale,

Please see tradersnewspower.com.  This will be the official website where the 
Cinergy Hourly Index will be posted.  Do we need to make any changes to the 
language and when will we be able to see this product on our stack manager?

Hope you had a good weekend.

Thanks.

Nicole
