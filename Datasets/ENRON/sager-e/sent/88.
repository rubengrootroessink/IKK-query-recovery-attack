Greg, I am not sure where we are on finalizing the Power (Physical) Master, 
but I read it again on the plane and have some minor clean-up matters.  I 
think you should set up a meeting next week b/w Milly, me and you to take 
Milly's comments and discuss and some business points with him.  You should 
also set up a meeting with Hemstock and Dadson to take their comments re: 
market operations.  Lastly you should set up a call with Hodge and Sager to 
get there comments.  I would like to have the Master signed off by end of 
next week.

Subject: Short Form (GTC) Physical Power Trading Document

Does ENA have a short form physical power trading document or GTC that it 
uses for short term power transactions for counterparties with whom it does 
not have a master?  As ECC is preparing its physical power trading documents 
right now, we need to also prepare a form of GTC and I thought that, since 
the EEI master was so helpful in my preparation of ECC's form of master, your 
form of GTC would be helpful as well.  If possible, could you e-mail the 
document to me?  I am hoping to put our form together next week.

Cheers

Greg
