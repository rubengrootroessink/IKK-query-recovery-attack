Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, 
including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on 
the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be 
administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it 
(lunch will be served)

Elizabeth,  you appear to have inadvertently been left off the list.  Ooops!  
Hope that you and your folks can attend the session. You may want to let 
Linda Noske know if you can attend the session so that she has an approximate 
headcount.  Thanks.  Julia

Subject: FREE LUNCH!

There IS such a thing as a free lunch (but you have to come to this meeting 
to get it).

On Tuesday, January 11, Chris Gaffney, Stuart Zisman, Dan Lyons and Karen 
Jones will discuss their experiences with some recently completed  
transactions.  These structured commodity deals were unique and interesting 
transactions, and transactions similar to these are expected to represent a 
growing portion of ENA's business.  This will be a good opportunity to find 
out more about this part of ENA's business, and to find out what our 
colleagues have been working on so hard over the past several months.

The transactions that we will discuss on Tuesday are only a few of the many 
deals that have been closed or are in the works, and additional meetings will 
be scheduled to learn more about some of these other transactions.  If there 
is a particular transaction that you would like to know more about, please 
let me know.      

On the agenda for Tuesday:

Chris Gaffney  -- United Illuminating
Stuart Zisman -- Project Doyle
Dan Lyons -- Project Saguaro
Karen Jones -- Project Big Horn (subject to Karen's availability)

The meeting will be held from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB30C1.
