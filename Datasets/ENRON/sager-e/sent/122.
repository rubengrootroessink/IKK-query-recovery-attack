This request from Shari is fine with me.  Could I also request a flat screen 
for my new office?

Thanks for your help.  Let me know what else I need to do.

I would like to request a 17 inch Flat Screen Monitor. I am moving into my 
new office, 3805 A, as of tomorrow. 

Thank you for taking care of this.
