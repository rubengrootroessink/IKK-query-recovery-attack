John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your "list" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the 
office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed 
language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of 
expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's 
review and comment.

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

John
