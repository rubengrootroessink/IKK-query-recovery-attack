I talked with Jim Steffes about the article below.  He stated that the PA 
company most at risk for a California type problem is GPU because it has 
divested its generation and will be in the market more.  (Maybe this creates 
an opportunity for EPMI selling a hedge product to GPU?)

Tom Chapman--Do you have additional info or insights on this?  Thanks.

Today's Electric Power daily discusses that due to high wholesale power 
prices, many PA customers are switching back to their utility that has capped 
prices.  Does this create the potential for a California situation with the 
utilities in PA?  I put in a call to Jim S too.  Thanks for your help.
