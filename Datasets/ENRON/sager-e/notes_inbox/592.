Elizabeth:  Not to add to your woes, but I am forwarding an e-mail from 
Michael re: SoCalEd which, as you know, could go the same route as PG&E in 
the not too distant future in light of the fact that its MOU with the State 
is not going anywhere.  We probably need to revisit our SCE exposures, 
including seeing whether we can get a better handle on what we may have 
running through the PX and ISO and any update on the "commandeered" contract 
(under which, I presume, we are still obligated to sell to CDWR (if I 
remember correctly the chain of events)). Also, we probably need to start 
thinking about extending the standstill letter with PG&E and dealing with 
renewing the LOCs on the EPMI power termination payment liability?  I have 
not heard anything on the PG&E front in this respect this week in terms of 
whether any further "settlement" talks have taken place.  Give me a call 
whenever you come up for air.  John

Michael,

The person to talk to is Bob Nelson, whom I believe you already know.  His 
number is 213-955-7175.  In addition, Carl and I are available to help out in 
any way needed.

Ben:


Can I get in touch with one of your senior bankruptcy people in Los
Angeles?   We need to begin to acquant ourselves with one of your
partners there (I assume they would file in Los Angeles).  It would
appear to me that Edison will file shortly.    I want to assure that we
have a shot at the committee there.


Michael
