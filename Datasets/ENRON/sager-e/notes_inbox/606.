Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there

PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother
who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon
together at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to
practice on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs.
