Good morning, Genia!!

 Attached is SRE's response to Enron's proposed Cover Sheet.  Note
that in the first section the blanks have been completed with various basic
info for the SRE operation.  In addition, SRE has included proposed changes
to certain Articles and to the General Terms and Conditions.  SRE's proposed
changes have been indicated with blue or red print.  For clarification,
could you briefly provide an explanation of the Exhibit B referenced in the
Prior Transactions paragraph in Part 1?

 Additionally, attached is a draft of SRE's Guaranty that has been
negotiated between our credit people which I understand is in its final
form.

 If you have any questions or require clarification, please advise
me.  Thanks for your assistance in processing this agreement.    Ron
