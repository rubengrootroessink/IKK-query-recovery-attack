I have reviewed the ADR proposal and have the following comments.

This ADR proposal is a double edged sword.  On the one hand - as members of 
WSCC it will help to protect us from antitrust liability.  On the other hand, 
only full members of WSCC are obligated under the ADR provisions (Section 
12.1), so just like the ADR provisions of NRTA/WRTA/SWRTA, entities merely 
have to quit WSCC to get out of the ADR obligation.  This is especially 
problematic with entities that are not FERC jurisdictional.  But, I think, on 
balance, we are probably more concerned about the antitrust protection, given 
that the WSCC usually makes decisions that effect operating systems much more 
than marketers, although this is changing over time.  What do others think?
 I agree with the proposal to have binding arbitration for such controversial 
matters as transmission path ratings.  Section 12.6.2.  The lack of such a 
mechanism has created extended FERC litigation concerning the Alturas line.   
Further, I agree with the grounds for appealing the arbitration decision 
(contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, lack of a fair hearing, or 
serious arbitrator misconduct).  Section 12.9.1.  However, the process for 
requiring FERC filings (under Sections 12.11) seem to undermine the binding 
nature of the arbitration provisions.  To really be binding, it seems like 
once the appeals process has been completed, Section 12.11 should require the 
prevailing and non-prevailing party to file joint filings to carry out the 
binding arbitration decisions.

Joe, the first three or four items on this list reflect the ADR duscussions 
and also inludes the document.   By the way, since I wil;l be attending the
