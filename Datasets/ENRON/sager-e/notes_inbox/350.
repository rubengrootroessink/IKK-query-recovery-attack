Good news gang!  The Black Hills EEI Agreement and Confirmation have been 
signed! Here are the final versions in case anyone is interested: 



The Escrow Agreement should be finalized on Monday. I have sent it to Outside 
Counsel for review and will get comments over the weekend. 

Thanks to everyone for getting this done, 

Shari
