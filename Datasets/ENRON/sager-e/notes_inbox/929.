Hi, Liz -Hope you are well . I just finished my MBA at Chicago and am
leaving MDCK shortly to look for something else to do either in Austin ,
Houston , back up on the East Coast or maybe in Europe, probably on the
business side or some law  -business combination.Should you hear of anything
or have any good ideas , I would appreciate hearing about them . Thanks. RP
