This is AEP's approach - I did not know all the background to this.

Shari:
I was not presently planning on participating.  I previously spoke with
Lisa Groff/Frank Hilton, my credit people participating on this
subcommittee, and we agreed that it was preferable to have the credit
managers and those on this mini-drafting group complete their assignment of
crafting a provision for the larger drafting committee of the EEI contract
to subsequently review.  The larger drafting committee would review to
ensure that the language, phrasing and structure of the document is
consistent with the existing EEI contract, and also have the larger group's
credit personnel involved in reviewing the subcommittee's work.  As a
result, I have not tried to redline at this juncture, because the smaller
drafting committee has not finished its work and created a consensus
document.

I agree that the timing at year end of this effort is really squeezing our
resources.

I am going to be on the call on Thursday  - are you? If so, how are you
approaching it? Are you going to come to the meeting with general comments
or are you going to circulate a redline in advance? Will your credit people
be on the line too?  It is quite a push to fit this in with everything else
that is going on at this time of year. I just wondered how you are treating
this from your company's perspective.

Personally I am going to try and get a redline out in advance of the call.
I will send it to everyone that is on the distribution list below.

Thanks!

S

To All:

Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for
consideration by the drafting committee and interested working group
participants.  If you provide your comments to me, I'll circulate them.
Bill is willing to have a conference call to discuss when everyone is
ready.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy
