Mike Tierney from Sempra asks a question about perfecting a security interest 
under the EEI contract.  Can any of you give me an answer for him?  Thanks.

Attached is a copy of section 8.3 from the EEI agreement.? I'm told that to 
get the security interest created by this section, a party would have to 
perfect their interest by making a UCC filing in a variety of states.? 

Are people doing this?
