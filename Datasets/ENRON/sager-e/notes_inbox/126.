Weekly Deals:

June 4-9, 2001











Paul Jaboulet Parallele 45 C"tes du Rh"ne 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


This fifth-generation producer specializes in Rh"ne Valley wines from their 
ideally-situated, carefully tended vineyards. This blend of Syrah and 
Grenache has an intense, complex nose, with aromas of ripe red fruit 
(raspberries, cassis), violets and licorice. The palate is fresh and rich; 
its tannic structure and strength are harmonious and remarkable. Long, fruity 
finish.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $7.88
Sale Price: $8.29













1999 Frei Brothers Reserve Sonoma County Merlot 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


The grapes for this wine were de-stemmed, but not crushed, to retain a 
substantial proportion of whole berries for fermentation.  This technique 
minimizes bitter tannin extraction in the wine. The wine was 100% barrel aged 
in a mixture of new and prior use French, European, and American oak for 
approximately a year. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.59
Sale Price: $13.25













Marcelina Vineyards, 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Concentrated blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit flavors framed by 
smoked bacon, tobacco, cedar notes, and coconut characteristics. Full-bodied 
with a velvety, silky texture and a lingering finish. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Gallo of Sonoma Barrelli Creek Vineyard Zinfandel 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Our family's Barrelli Creek Vineyard is located in the temperate, Region III 
hillsides of Sonoma County's Alexander Valley; on a site first planted by 
Italian immigrants over a century ago. The low vigor of this vineyard's 
gravelly clay loam soils, in combination with its micro-climate and optimal 
viticultural practices, yield intensely concentrated Zinfandel and Petite 
Sirah grapes loaded with the zesty aromas and flavors of black cherries, 
boysenberry jam, and black pepper.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.82
Sale Price: $13.49













Jim Beam Bourbon 80o 1.75L

[IMAGE]


A bourbon of great finesse and subtle nuance, neither light nor heavy, but 
rather a mellow "baritone" of a spirit. It is distinctive not because it is 
different, but because it is perfect. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Belvedere Vodka 80o750ml.

[IMAGE]


One of the first grain-based deluxe vodkas of Poland, known for its strong 
Polish character and its unique bottle, with a window on the front through 
which the illustration on the back (of the official residence of the Polish 
president in Warsaw) can be seen magnified by the vodka.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $24.99
Sale Price: $26.31













Beaufond V.S.O.P. Cognac 80o750ml.

[IMAGE]


This small but excellent producer is situated in the heart of the Grande 
Champagne district. Masterfully blended and distinctively packaged, it is one 
of the best values for the price in Cognac.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $14.99
Sale Price: $15.78













Edna Valley Chardonnay 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Located just south of San Luis Obispo on California's Central Coast, Edna 
Valley is ideally situated for the production of premium Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir. Their Chardonnay is full-bodied with smoky aromas of vanilla, oak and 
spice. The mouthfeel is soft and lush, but at the same time intense, with 
ripe flavors of white peach, apple and tropical fruits. A subtle mineral 
component complements the higher acid level, lending structure, balance, and 
complexity.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.99
Sale Price: $13.67













Lindemans Shiraz/Cabernet, Cawarra 1.5L.

[IMAGE]


Dr. Henry Lindeman planted his first grape vines in 1843 along the Paterson 
River in New South Wales, Australia. His homestead, Cawarra, is named after 
the aboriginal term for "beside running water," and Cawarra Claret was the 
first wine he exported. Today, the Cawarra line commemorates these first 
wines. The Shiraz/Cabernet is easy drinking and approachable with generous 
varietal fruit flavors and aromatic oak in the background.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $6.88
Sale Price: $7.24
