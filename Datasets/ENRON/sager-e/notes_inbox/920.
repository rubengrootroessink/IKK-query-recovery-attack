Is anyone working on a physical master with this counterparty? If so please 
could you advise Tana of progress.
 
Many thanks.

Do you know the progress of getting a physical power master in place with 
this counterparty?  Can you keep me apprised.  They are obviously a 
quasi-affiliate and we have internal people contacting me checking on their 
progress.  Thanks!
