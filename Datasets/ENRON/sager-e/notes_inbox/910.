Elizabeth & Christian:  I had trouble forwarding an e-mail relating to the 
same but have copied it below.  It describes a movement by certain CA 
legislators to attempt to enact a "windfall profits tax" on electricity 
sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on 
electricity sales.  You will recall this was one of the items addressed in 
our "pass through" clause in the proposed CDWR contract.  I know that we, as 
Firm, looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating 
to such a tax a few months ago, so let me know if, in your spare time, you 
would like me to pull anything on it.  John

Proposed Windfall Profit Tax

The key state democratic legislators are working
 behind the scenes to develop a Windfall Profits Tax bill in
>retaliation for high wholesale prices.  It is not yet in print.  Here
> is an analysis of the expected bill by an attorney for the Independent
> Energy Producers.

>Preliminary analysis of State Windfall
