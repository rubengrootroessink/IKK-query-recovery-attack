Due to the flooding, electrical and communications problems in Houston over 
the weekend, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced 
outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be 
operational.  

In the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories 
had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, 
some of you may be missing data files on your H drive or M drive that you 
created or modified on Friday.  

If you have any questions or have any IT related problems, please contact the 
Resolution Center at x31411 for assistance.
