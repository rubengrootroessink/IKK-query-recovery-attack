HEre's the resume of someone that Lloyd met at a conference this week.  It 
looks like she has a lot of experience -- some of it  power related, and 
might be worth an interview.  Didn't want to send it to Michelle, since I'm 
not sure when she's taking over the recruiting stuff.  Let me know if I can 
help further.  
Regards,
Janice

Dear Lloyd---I really enjoyed meeting you yesterday at the Greater Houston
Partnership luncheon and truly appreciate your prompt inquiries on my behalf!
 Attached are a resume, "highlights sheet" and summary of recent assignments
which outline my experience as a corporate attorney.  As I had mentioned,
there are two emphases in my generalist career: (1) finance and transactions;
and (2) labor and employment law.  Along the way I have also addressed
anti-trust, corporate secretarial, environmental, some intellectual property
and some real estate matters.  In the marketing/trading arena, you will see
the reference to ISDA's and GISB's plus commodities swap and futures trading
agreements.  I look forward to sitting down with you and/or others in the
Enron organization to detail my background in person.  Please let me know if
there is any problem opening this document.

Again, thank you for "putting my name in the ring" .  I hope we can meet
again soon.
                                                        Alice Ginsburgh
