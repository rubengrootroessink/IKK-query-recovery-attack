Unfortunately I came down the flu yesterday and wasn't able to attend the 
meeting.  Please send me the minutes too.

I don't know how far things got yesterday, but I was going to volunteer to be 
on the smaller drafting committee that was talked about at the previous 
meeting.  If they are still looking for volunteers, I would be happy to 
volunteer.

No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Dave
