All:

I just wanted to thank everyone for their great effort on the Pepperell 
deal.  I know it was a bit frustrating at times, but in the end I think we 
will derive a lot of value out of this deal and benefit from the learning 
experience of managing generation in NEPOOL.   Kevin Presto and Dana Davis 
made it clear that this position will be a nice strategic addition to our 
NEPOOL book.

On to the next one!

Regards
John
