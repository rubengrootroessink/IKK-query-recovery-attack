If EAS is here, that would be better, b/c more likely to meet Rogers's 
deadline....  Has credit signed off on these deals???

Janice, can you look at it as soon as you get off the conference call.  
Rogers wanted the confirms out by 9:00 this morning.  Otherwise, can we get 
Elizabeth to look at it.  Sharen dropped the language into the confirm that 
Shari had drafted for the previous deals with Entergy confirmed under the 
WSPP.  We have used this language in the past with the only difference being 
these are options.

Janice,

I found out these involve an "east" delivery point and the trader, Rodgers 
Herndon needs them looked at this morning.  Is is possible for you to review 
these ASAP?

Thanks,
Genia

P.S.  Christian, you are "off the hook"!!!

Christian,

Since this involves the WSPP, would you have time to look at these and 
respond to Sharen?

Thanks,
Genia

Shari Stack had agreed to confirm non-firm deals with Entergy Services under 
the WSPP.  Then she reluctantly agreed to use the WSPP for a few month long 
term deals.  Well, now we have two options that they want to confirm under 
the WSPP.  We do not have any other existing agreement with Entergy 
Services.  I have dropped in the language Shari prepared for the month long 
deal.  Can someone take a look at these and see if this will confirm the deal.

Thanks!
