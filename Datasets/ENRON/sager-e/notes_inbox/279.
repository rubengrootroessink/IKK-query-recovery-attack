This is our argument now on appeal in Entergy source and sink -- that FERC 
has always deferred to NERC and totally disregarded the NERC letters against 
TVA and MAIN in the Entergy order.  FERC staff's quote should be helpful in 
our brief at the DC Circuit.

transmission reliability questions..."
