Since I'm actually here in NY on that day, I'll plan to attend the 12/14
lunch if for no other reason than to listen/collect input and info for the
committee.

Regards.

Fritz.

Andy, can you facilitate setting up a conference call with Bill McCoy and
the respective credit managers of the drafting committee for December 14th
or thereabouts?

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may
raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.
