Hi, Liz.  Thank you for the call yesterday.  I am sorry I did not call
back.  I had Andrew till mid-afternoon and had planned to go over to Chi's,
but she went to Dege's uncle's.  Chi and I talked in the afternoon and she
was very sad.  I was pretty lonely myself.

About the car--I went around to different dealerships on Saturday and
couldn't get a clear offer of more than $2000 for it in a trade.  The
temporary tag expires this week, so  I imagine I (or Chi if she wants to)
will have to register it in Maryland to keep it or sell it.  It has a
couple of significant problems that would be clear to a buyer--one rear
window is broken and stuck in the fully open position, and the driver's
seat can not be moved backward.  If both were fixed, (both involve, at
least in part, electric motors--$500??) I think it might sell out of the
newspaper for about $4500.  I will discuss it with Chi.

Do you have any sense as to how long it will take you to complete settling
Mom's estate?  That definitely enters into my thinking about a new car.   I
had mentioned the possibility to you of wanting a loan in April or May--I
think I have managed to postpone my anticipated debt from legal expenses
until December.
