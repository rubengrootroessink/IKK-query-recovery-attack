This is one of Suzanne's friends.    Do you have any interest in talking to 
her about the legal assistant position?

Carol, did you look over Penny's resume?  Interested?  She just called this 
morning and said her job has been eliminated.  She's freaking out!  

Did you find a restaurant for your mom and sister? I didn't get the voice 
mail until this morning.  I'm so sorry. I don't know any vegetarian 
restaurants though.
