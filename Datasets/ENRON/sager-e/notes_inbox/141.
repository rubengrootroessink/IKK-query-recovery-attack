After a spell of private medical crisis which had the effect of distorting my 
professional schedule, I am, for better or worse, back in the professional 
saddle.  My private life remains, as always, full of much upheaval, creative 
energy and manic playfulness.  My beloved Dona Lisa is going to be fine. The 
trip to St. Louis was not meant to be.  Jan got everything cancelled without 
any loss of money to Enron shareholders.  I am back in the trenches trying to 
get the PacifiCorp EEI done so Harlan can have the pleasure of working 
through the big mother of all call options on JUNE 1, your big kickoff date 
for living happily ever after.  Hope everything went well with Steve down 
there.  I'm looking forward to assessing his reactions to the big E in 
Houston. ----cgy
