Hi Liz -- I talked to Grant today and he told me you guys will be heading
to Washington for Christmas and for your sister's wedding.  We wish it
would have worked out for you to come to the big D but understand.  He also
filled me on on your unstoppable ascendancy to the top of the charts of
your club's tennis elite.  I'm not surprised and good luck.  Do you yell
every time you hit the ball yet?

We'll be working on a country weekend in January for us all to get together
in the beautiful Hico, Texas area.  As the realtors say, it is the "top of
the hill country".

Martin
