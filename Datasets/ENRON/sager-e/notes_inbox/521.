FYI -- Spoke to Rogers this a.m. and told him that you and I are all over 
this deal.  He was glad -- says there's "real money" in this deal.  Joe says 
that PSEG language should be here today.
Regards,
Janice

I guess this kind of speaks for itself.  We will have a bid and preliminary 
legal language from PSEG today.  I will let you know when we have them.  
Also, for Edith and Posey, I have attached the new MW/Heat Rate schedule.  
Thanks.

Joe -

Where are we with PSE&G?  Who is the lawyer working on this deal?  This deal 
is my #1 priority at this point and I would like to make sure that everyone 
understands the signifigance and urgency.

Thanks,
Rogers
