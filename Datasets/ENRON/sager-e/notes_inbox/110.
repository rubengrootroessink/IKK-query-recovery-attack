I am just again following up as to what we should do with these partially 
paid invoices.  I would want to be careful that we do not set a precedent for 
accepting less than full payment.  Peter.

Just to follow up, what should we do to address partial payments of our

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl
