The Business Day language will impose greater planning disclipline on all=

parties, however If the requirement is for the scheduling to be  the day=20
before, whether a holiday or not, then the language can be changed to read =

Marcus,

Peter and Kevin's concern with the language you suggested is that NERC=20
holidays do not coincide with Federal Reserve banking holidays.  Martin=20
Luther King Day, Washington's Day, Columbus Day, and Veteran's Day are all=
=20
Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=
=20
power to be scheduled the day before delivery, the language defining busine=
ss=20
day as " a day on which Federal Reserve member banks in New York City are=
=20
open for business" prohibits scheduling on these 4 days mentioned above. =
=20
Please feel free to contact either myself or Peter Makkai with any question=
s.

Thanks,

  Marcus,

Peter Makkai and Kevin Presto on the East Power desk are following up with=
=20
their request for additional super peak loadshape language which states "Fi=
rm=20
energy shall be scheduled on a day ahead basis.  =01+Day ahead basis=01, me=
ans a=20
day during the term of the transaction which precedes the Delivery Day." =
=20
Evidently, whenever they transact with this product, they are having to=20
contact the customer and inform them of this scheduling parameter.  I know=
=20
you were in the process of changing the language for all Into products and=
=20
was wondering when this scheduling parameter could be added to this=20
particular loadshape.

Thanks Marcus,

Chris

If it is firm Energy, to be delivered for a fixed period, starting and=20
finishing at  the times specified, it is unclear why the scheduling=20
requirement is applicable at all.=20

The obligations are to deliver and receive and the parties have agreed to=
=20
that. If there is a failure to deliver or failure to receive then the GTCs=
=20
provide the non-defaulting party with a remedy.=20

Please could you forward me the complete product description in any event.

Please review the following loadshape language.  Peter Makkai would like to=

add the language in RED.

The transaction is for the hours beginning with the hour ending 1300 (12:00=

Review the folowing loadshape language and let me know of any suggestions. =
