THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does 
not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, 
maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They 
can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and 
yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. 
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El 
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the 
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. 
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and 
meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that 
their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the 
nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have 
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping 
gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand 
that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by 
closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the 
energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to 
repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have 
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is 
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying 
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit 
of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but 
don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we 
forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that 
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using 
energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the 
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing 
machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task 
at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but 
never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains 
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You 
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he 
can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social 
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we 
kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional 
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals 
under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get 
away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active 
villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a 
corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any 
extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We 
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we 
see. And we await developments, or create them. 

It would be foolish to mention SUVs. When the brain is ready, the ear will 
hear. 
Restless by day, and by night, rants and rages at the stars; God help the
