Attached is the draft which now incorporates some comments Janelle gave me 
today.  Could you please advise as to the following: 

1. The LDC is the Default Provider, not NEPOOL. Are there any additional 
changes you would make because of this? I am sure that Sections 2 and 3 are 
affected somehow. What are your thoughts on the best way to capture this? 

2. In Section 9 under (a), she wants to allude to the fact that if the 
Congestion Management System comes into effect, then we will be "assigned 
their load". I kind of get what she is talking about but have no idea what to 
say about it. What would you recommend?

If you want, just fax to me the pages on which you have corrections. My fax 
no is (503) 464-8058. 

Thanks, 

Shari
