Thanks for your call last night.  I am going to AA meetings almost every
night these days.  I find them useful and helpful, for sake of a better way
to describe it.  Unless I have some other activity plannd, I usually go
meetings that start at 8:30, so I don't get home until clost to 10.

I really like the idea of going to the beach with you.  The triathlon
weekend in late September would be great.   I don't know about doing the
triathlon though.  I would love to, but I am nowhere near in shape to do
the running.  I tried to start running a few weeks ago, after about a year
off, and I quickly developed a heel bruise.  Running is out of the question
for a while.  I have been swimming regularly since Memorial Day when the
pool opened, and I have been biking.

I watched parts of a public TV show about energy problems the last two
nights  Enron came off as something like the evil, rich king.
