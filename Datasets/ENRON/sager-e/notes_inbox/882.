Elizabeth;

I am based in the S?o Paulo Office and can be reached at 
011-55-11-5503-1226.  Are you talking about Monday (today or next week) ?  
Monday usually don't look good for me (several meetings with the trading 
guys).  Can we schedule a conference call tomorrow or Wednesday ?  Please 
note that I am 3 hours ahead of Houston time.

Rgds,

Sami
