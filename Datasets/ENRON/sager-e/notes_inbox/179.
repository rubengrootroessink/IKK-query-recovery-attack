Subject: RE: Sysco Energy Services and Sales Agreement 

The following are my thoughts on the draft (without discussion with Sysco): 

1.? In Section 1.3.2, why should curtailed usage be applied towards Excess 
Usage?? How is EESI at risk if Actual Usage (not including curtailed energy) 
is within the permitted band?? Same comment in Section 2.2.4.

2.????? In Section 3.5, if we don't elect to treat the Facility as a Closed 
Facility for purposes of Schedule 2.0 within 24 months, your draft would have 
us making Deficiency Usage payments forever, which is inconsistent with the 
rationale you provided for requiring a 24 month cut-off.? We assumed that 
after 24 months, if we didn't make an election, we would be required to make 
an Early Termination Payment. 

3.????? In Section 3.6, I will send some changes that reflect the fact that 
we can substitute a Closed Facility with multiple Substitute Facilities, so 
long as we bear any additional costs (which I think is what we discussed).? 
Also, in the last sentence of that Section, we had discussed treating Excess 
and Deficiency Usage situations the same as we usually do, which means that 
EESI might end up owing Sysco money for such Usage.? I'll send proposed 
changes on this point.

4.????? In Section 4.6, the language you deleted still needs to apply to 
(b)(iii), unless EESI is willing to agree to continue to be obligated.

I'll follow up with a mark-up later. 

Thanks.
