I have reviewed Chris' version of the Confirmation below.  I have made a
few changes to it now that there is only one Delivery Period.  The attached
is red-lined for ease of reference.

As far as I am concerned, it is ready to go. Let's see if Elizabeth
concurs.

Thanks,

Shari

The attachment  cleans up a few nits.  The word "Period" was omitted in
a couple spots in the Description of Transaction paragraph.  Got weekend
plans?
