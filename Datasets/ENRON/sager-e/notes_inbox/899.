Elizabeth,

I decided this weekend that I would like to go to the conference if there is 
still room.  In addition to the educational benefits, BPA may be sending some 
folks, which would give you and I an additional opportunity to sell  them on 
the EEI in a more relaxed setting (perhaps over dinner?).  Do you have a list 
of conference attendees?    

Also, as you know, we are trying to get an EEI in place with WAPA.  Because 
of the PG&E bankruptcy, WAPA and its customers cannot count on PG&E 
deliveries, and are therefore looking to cover perhaps 500 MW.  However, 
there is a bottleneck in the WAPA organization that is preventing 
implementation of an EEI, and therefore preventing EPMI from getting the 
business.  It would be helpful to know if WAPA is sending anyone.     

Also, if many customers or potential customers are attending, Stewart Rosman 
and possibly other traders may be interested in going to develop business.  
(Stewart expressed his interest.)  What do you think about that idea?

Best,

Steve
