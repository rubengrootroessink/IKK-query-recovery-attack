Happiness is looking at the new legal org chart (which Jan just now dropped 
on my desk).   I always approach these dry documents as though they were 
trigrams resulting  from throwing the coins and consulting the I-Ching.   At 
the top of the trigram which I find myself listed in I see a single name:  
Elizabeth Sager,  and at the bottom I see the name Genia FitzGerald.  The 
name at the top signifies all is well in the heavens and the name at the 
bottom signifies all is well on earth, and my name between the two means all 
is well beside the flowing river.  A new star has ascended into  the vault of 
the heavens above me and my most beloved of long standing friends from the 
trenches is steadfastly walking beside me below,  and all is very very 
blissful indeed for the itinerant, journeyman energy attorney.

To the Casino I say:   throw anything you've got at me and be damned!
