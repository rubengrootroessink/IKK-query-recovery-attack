Just a few comments on the basis of this week's discussion.

1.  Use concept of amounts owed and accrued, but not yet payable

2.  Include deemed designations

3.  Do we want to include concepts of (a) amounts in any currency (or is this 
implied) or (b) amounts in respect of any booking or payment office?


Cordially,
