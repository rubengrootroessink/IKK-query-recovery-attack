Subject: Trading on Inside Information

In a meeting yesterday with some ENA traders, it was argued that in the 
finanical markets people are not allowed to trade in a stock if they have 
material information that would move the market.

In the power business, people that control 15,000 MW are allowed to buy and 
sell financial products with the "inside" knowledge that their units may be 
off.  Is this illegal or could we make it illegal?  What are the restrictions 
here?

I guess the issue also involves CFTC regulation, or lack of regulation?  If 
FERC has the field, why don't we continue to push for more market 
transparency?
