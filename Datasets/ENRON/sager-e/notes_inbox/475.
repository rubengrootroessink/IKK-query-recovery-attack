GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ
On Monday, December 11th at 7pm, join SPEC's and The
Wine School for GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ. We'll taste
and talk about 12 of the best Shiraz wines Australia has
to offer. Topics of discussion will include how Shiraz got
to Australia, how Australian Shiraz developed into the
wine it is today, how Aussie Shiraz differs from Syrah
wines made in France or the US, and the winemaking that
goes into producing the best of these uniquely Australian
wines. The anticipated lineup includes Clarendon Hills
Liandra Shiraz 1998, Langmeil Shiraz 1998, Penny's Hill
Shiraz 1997, Haan Shiraz 1998, St. Hallet's Old Block
Shiraz 1995, Ausvetia Shiraz 1996, Rosemount Hill of
Gold Shiraz 1998, Rosemount Balmoral Shiraz 1997,
d'Arenberg Dead Arm Shiraz 1998, and Penfold's RWT
Shiraz 1997 along with the two giants of Aussie Shiraz,
Henschke's Hill of Grace 1995 and Penfold's Grange
Hermitage 1995. GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ will cost
$92.00 per person (cash) with a $10.00 discount available
for 1,000  SPEC's KEY Points. The high cost of this class
is due to the expense of the wines to be tasted. For
directions, reservations, or more information on this
class, please call SPEC's at 713-526-8787. This event will
be held at l'Alliance Francaise, 427  Lovett Boulevard
(on the southeast corner of Lovett and Whitney, one block
south of  Westheimer). The price includes SPEC's famous
5% discount for cash.

DECEMBER 2000 12-UNDER-$12
    Sometimes you don't need a "great" bottle of wine. Sometimes you just 
want a cheap bottle and it wouldn't bother you at all if it were to taste 
really good. We're in the same boat. We're always looking for wine that 
tastes like it costs more than it does, preferably wine priced under $12.00. 
So here are twelve of our favorites, all priced under $12.00.

LOUIS M. MARTINI Cabernet Sauvignon, California, 1998  (12x750ml $8.21 
$91.85)  Fine classic California Cabernet nose with notes of dusty oak, 
cedar, tobacco, and lots of fine black and red berry fruit. Super juicy with 
great fruit flavor in the mouth, a dusty, Napa-like texture, and a really 
nice medium-weight feel. The dusty fruit and tobacco notes last to the end. 
Martini is making perhaps the best buy available in a value-priced California 
Cabernet. Solidly Fine. SPEC's Score: 89+ points.

CAPEZZANO Montalbano Chianti DOCG 1997  (12x750ml $10.43 $115.49)  From the 
best modern Tuscan vintage on record, this is a nicely balanced, subtle, 
well-integrated Chianti featuring great cherry fruit and some ripe plum along 
with hints of tobacco and exotic wood. Rich and satisfying in the mouth, it 
is juicy with fruit and flavor. Good length. Finishes dry and slightly chewy. 
Delicious and Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils "Le Chamville" Macon-Villages, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  Crisp, well-focused, nicely balanced Macon Chardonnay featuring 
good tropical and banana fruit with a refreshing citrusy acidity and an 
unexpected but welcome mineral note. Has enough richness to keep it 
interesting. Long and fresh tasting. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 86+ points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils "La Vignee" Bourgogne Pinot Noir, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  This well-balanced Burgundy Pinot Noir shows plenty of cherry fruit 
and hints of earth and mineral that start on the nose and expand onto the 
palate. The flavors are well-focused but there is a good level of richness.  
The finish really lasts and stays fresh to the end. Very tasty cheap Pinot; 
Really Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. de la GREFFIERRE Macon la Roche Vineuse (Vielles Vignes) 1999 (12x750ml 
$10.40 $115.48)  Very nicely structured estate-bottled, old-vine Macon with 
nice mineral and terroir notes and good banana and pear fruit with a fresh 
tropical lime acidity that emerges through the subtle oak component. Quite 
tasty but a little sneaky; this is one of those wines that really grows on 
you while you?re drinking it. Fine. SPEC's Score: 89 points.

OXFORD LANDING Limited Release Grenache, South Australia, 1998  (12x750ml 
$8.86 $98.30)  Here?s a juicy, grapy, peppery, vibrantly fruity Grenache with 
just enough acid to keep it somewhat balanced. No complexity at all but its 
thrill is that it's a real fruit bomb. Quite fresh tasting but also solid and 
satisfying. Quite yummy; Really very good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. MEUNIER St. LOUIS, Corbieres, 1998 (12x750ml $9.45 $98.28) Here?s another 
super value in a 1998 from the south of France. This well-built 
Grenache-dominated red is chock full of juicy black grapy-berry fruit and 
subtle spice with a hint of Corbieres? earthy terroir. The wine is  balanced 
and fresh in the mouth with a fine, medium-weight feel and a softly chewy 
texture. The fruit and spice last through the fine finish. This one has both 
the fruit to handle a bit of spice and the stuffing to handle beef. Served 
cool (58-60o), it may be the perfect fajita wine. Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 
points.

PENFOLD's Koonunga Hill Chardonnay, Southeastern Australia, 1999  (12x 750ml 
$6.57 $73.45)  Really surprising for a value-priced (read cheap) Aussie 
Chardonnay, this Koonunga Hill has plenty of fruit but it is more in the 
green apple and green banana range than it is like the typical Aussie 
pineapple juice Chardonnay. The fruit is well complimented with a welcome 
mineral component and  enough acidity to keep everything fresh and balanced. 
Quite elegant with good length showing mineral-character and fruit that lasts 
to the end. Good food Chardonnay. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

M. TRINCHERO Merlot, California Coastal, 1997  (12x750ml $8.57 $95.79)  Soft 
textured, juicy, everyday-priced Merlot with plenty of ripe cherry Merlot 
fruit. Fresh and lively and full of flavor in a medium weight, very 
drinkable, well-balanced style. Simple but delicious, it makes a super party 
red. Really Very Good.  SPEC's Score: 87 points.

HOGUE Fume Blanc, Columbia Valley, 1999  (12x750ml $5.75 $64.25)  Very fresh 
tasting, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc with good crisp pear and lemon fruit, 
hints of green melon, and a touch of perfume (and no grassiness). Long and 
lively, it finishes dry. Good as an aperitif or with simple seafoods 
(especially oysters). Think of it as a sort of American Entree Deux Mers. 
Very Good. Spec's Score: 86 points.

MARTIN & WYRICH Moscato Allegro, California, 1999  (12x750ml $9.95 $111.30)  
This delicious Orange Muscat is fresh, bright, and alive with lots of 
perfumed orange blossom and honeysuckle fruit. Surprisingly lively despite 
its sweetness, this wine is quite fresh in the mouth with just a touch of 
frizzante. Long and balanced with a clean, lemon candy-like finish it is very 
refreshing and quite delicious. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

RAMOS PINTO Ruby Port, NV  (6x750ml $10.96 $60.03) Here?s a juicy, grapy red 
Port featuring a good mix of fruit and fire along with good weight and 
richness. The fruit is in the dark berry and grape juice range with just a 
touch of extra ripeness. This solid, everyday Port has the ability to keep 
for many weeks after the bottle is opened but enough flavor to make sure it 
is drunk sooner. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87 points.
