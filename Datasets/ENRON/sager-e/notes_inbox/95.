I'm providing you this to keep you informed on the marketing services deal 
being pitched to the operator of a Norfolk VA. garbage burning facility. 
Below are a letter of intent and attached term sheet being made into clean 
copies and circulated this evening to SPSA for their review and signature.  
Heather Hearn and the 'Services Desk' folks are involved. It is interesting 
-- please come back to me with any questions you may have.   --David
