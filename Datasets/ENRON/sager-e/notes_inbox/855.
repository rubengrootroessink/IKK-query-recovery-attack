Seems that Rogers isn't as keen on this meeting as credit and legal had 
thought.  This is what Keegan got back when she tried to set the meeting on 
his calendar.  It's not really going to help much for me to stay in the 
middle of this, but it seems pretty clear to me that Rogers has a different 
view of where this was left than than you guys had.  The most efficient thing 
might be a quick phone call from Elizabeth to Rogers -- which might get the 
whole thing back on track.

Keegan -

Thank you for forwarding this e-mail.  Please pass on that I do not need to 
meet on the agency issues relating to Entergy again.  I have done this 
several times and unfortunately, nothing is ever resolved.  If legal/credit 
would like to meet with Entergy, have them provide me with a list of specific 
issues and proposals, people from Entergy they would like to meet with and 
some proposed dates.  I will try to arrange the meeting with Entergy from 
there.

Thanks again,
Rogers

Regards,
Janice
