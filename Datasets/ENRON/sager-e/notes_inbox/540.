Hey Elizabeth.

Well I'm not sure when we will be able to make up the game.  I was out of 
town last week and am in St Louis as I write this to you.  I will be here 
till Friday and then back again on Sunday night until the end of the week.  I 
saw Dan yesterday during lunch and he reminded me of it too... he knows my 
situation so I think he will understand if we end up not playing until the 
new year.  I wish we could play it before then but it doesn't look like my 
schedule will accomodate it... I am also leaving for NY on the 25th for Xmas 
with Bryan's family till the 2nd.  

Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thanks for getting in contact 
with me... I am in way over my head not only with snow tonight :) but with 
work and school.  

Are you going out of town for Xmas?  

Don't practice too much... I haven't played in weeks so I am back to square 
one... I think Dan might have to show me what a racket looks like again!!!!!

Take care and I will keep you up to date on what's happening with my schedule 
and when we can get together.

Char

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya
