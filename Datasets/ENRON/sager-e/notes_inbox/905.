Ben, I'd appreciate anything you have about Enron's claims.  We've discussed 
it with the debtor and it does not contest the energy providers are the real 
parties in interest and don't contest they ought to be represented on the 
committee. As for a meeting, I can't promise I have time for that at this 
point.  I will give you a call Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks.
Steve

Steve,

As I mentioned in the voicemail I left for you today, we will get something 
to you in writing on Tuesday regarding Enron's claims.  The "back of the 
envelope" estimate I am getting is in the $600 to $700 million range.  Would 
it be possible to meet with you sometime on Tuesday fro ten to fifteen 
minutes to explain Enron's claims to you?

Ben

Ben -- It's Saturday at 10:30.  Give me a call today. -705-3340 (please don't 
give my Dir. Dial out, thanks).
NO committee will be appointed this weekend; we can't do it that fast, but we 
would have if we could ...

Are you still there?

could you call me?

I urgently need to talk to someone in UST's office.  We represent Enron and 
heard a rumor that a committee will be formed this weekend.  The debtor's 
info regarding Enron's claim is not accurate, and we want the opportunity to 
show what we think the right number should be.
