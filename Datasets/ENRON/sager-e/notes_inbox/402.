No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Dave
