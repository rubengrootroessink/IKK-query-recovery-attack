I am revising my current draft of it for Liz, but she and Carol have also 
been involved.  I'm not sure who will be "leading" this effort ultimately.

Do you know which attorney at Enron will be leading this effort?

Subject: Collateral Annex Activities

As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion 
draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, 
may send me comments on the intial draft prepared by Bill McCoy last winter 
by JUNE 6.  Enron's discussion draft will then be prepared based on comments 
received and circulated for further discussion.

The collateral group agreed to meet in Houston on July 31.  I would like to 
schedule the Drafting Committee meeting either on the 7/30 or 8/1.
