I really don't want to beat this to death, but I'm afraid I don't know how to 
be more precise than this note, sent to you a month ago.  I didn't leave you 
a voicemail about this at the time b/c we were already leaving each other 
lots of voicemails about various deals and I didn't want the details, dates, 
etc. to get lost.  Since 1996 when I came to Enron, I've only stayed with my 
family during the holidays once -- because of year-end deals.  And last 
Thanksgiving, I spent the whole day on the telephone and flew out to 
Singapore the day after Thanksgiving to close the SK Korea deal.  I know what 
4Q is like around here, and I would never have asked except for the 
extraordinary occasion.  I'm sorry, but I just don't think that we're 
connecting and I don't know how to improve the quality of our communications.

Haven't heard about coordinating schedules for the group yet, and I know 
there might be some uncertainty just now b/c of the reorgs, but I'd like to 
know if the following is ok with you.  
Thanksgiving:  I'd like to go to my daughter's baby shower in VA on Sat. 
11/18, take my computer, and then work from VA on Mon, Tue, Wed -- rather 
than flying back here on Monday and flying back there again on Wed.  That's 
assuming there isn't a deal that needs me to go to meetings in Houston (or 
Singapore, for that matter) during that week.  
Christmas:  I'd like to use all remaining vacation days from 2000 after 
Christmas and not return til after mid January or after my grandson is born 
(his due date is 1/3/01), assuming I've used pretty much all vacation for 
2001at that point. 
Travel plans need to be made pretty soon, as you know, so the sooner I get 
your decision the better.  Thanks very much.
