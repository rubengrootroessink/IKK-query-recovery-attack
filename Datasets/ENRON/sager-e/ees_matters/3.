Carol,  this is one of the deals on the list we discussed this morning.  Since it is on the fastest track, we need to discuss at our meeting tomorrow.  Cathy will coordinate with you to set up a time.

Debbie,
 
Attached is a draft of the referenced agreement which  has been redlined to reflect Sysco's comments.  The draft has not been  reviewed completely by me or at all by Sysco's business people, so it remains  subject to additional comments.  I will see you at 2pm.
 
Aaron
