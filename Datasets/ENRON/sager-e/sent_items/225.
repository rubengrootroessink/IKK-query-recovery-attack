Hello Everyone,

I am Bowling, yes, you saw right bowling for Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)  Saturday, July 14th.
So I am fishing for donations   << OLE Object: Microsoft Word Picture >> 

Would any of you marvelously wonderful, generous, philanthropic people, like to donate to the cause (and I don't mean the Suzanne Kelly cause)?  All donations will benefit research for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and 40 other neuromuscular diseases.  Any donations would be greatly appreciated.  I can be contacted by e-mail or at 713-345-4192.

Thank you all in advance,

Sincerely,
Suzanne Kelly
