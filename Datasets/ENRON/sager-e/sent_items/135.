My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Cly=
de's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the mod=
ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were =
starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But=
 in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin=
g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve=
ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe=
rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall=
enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will=
 be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After=
 hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne=
w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me=
et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi=
ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide=
nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be=
 able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p=
ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  =
He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h=
im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is =
something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c=
an begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet an=
other name for himself.=20

The clincher will be Clyde recommending a two-week conference at Club Med i=
n Jamaica to draft a "transition plan" for the WSPP.

More changes, all made as the slouching hound  creeps forward shamelessly, =
in its perverse sickness,   looking more and more like what they dread the =
most:  the EEI.  I remember as a kid, there would be things that my older b=
rother would do that I would secretly envy and want to copy, but his scorn =
kept me from doing it.  But slowly, secretly, over time, I would copy him a=
nyway and at the critical moment of being caught, just act like I had no id=
ea what the hell he was talking about, that I had always done things this w=
ay.  This is what is going on with the WSPP.  They shamelessly creep toward=
 being more and more like the EEI, all the while feigning unique identity. =
 At some point we have to have somebody stand up and advocate merger.  I wa=
nt to be that person that history calls to make that speech.  I want Clyde =
Durham to rise from his chair in one of those hideous hotel conference room=
s with the sliding panel walls, the brown  carpet, the plastic podium with =
that hated overhead projector and big white screen,  I want to rise up in t=
hat setting in front of all those contract administration nerds and passion=
ately argue for merger!  Please let me move in this direction!  I want it t=
o be on my resume that I was the catalyst for the death of the WSPP by merg=
er.    ----cgy =20
