Andy

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

*	Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
*	Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
*	In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.
