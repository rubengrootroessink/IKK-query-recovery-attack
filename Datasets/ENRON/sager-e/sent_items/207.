JONES NEWSWIRES   Jul. 17, 2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2=
001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An executive descri=
bed as "a seasoned trader" will lead Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications=
 unit after its current chief executive takes a different position within c=
orporation in the next two weeks. James Fallon, president and chief operati=
ng officer, will lead Enron Broadband Services after it becomes part of Enr=
on's Wholesale Services Group.   Broadband Services Senior Vice President K=
elly Kimberly told Dow Jones Newswires Fallon will lead the organization af=
ter Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive, moves to a corporate job at=
 Enron.   Fallon was unavailable to talk to Dow Jones for this story.   One=
 broker said Fallon's selection indicated Enron isn't backing away from dev=
eloping the bandwidth market.   "Jim Fallon is a seasoned trader," the brok=
er said. "He made a killing in the power markets. He has a huge reputation =
for making money."   The broker speculated that Fallon may increase the num=
ber of traders Enron has in the bandwidth market. Broadband Services has an=
nounced plans to reassign and possibly layoff non-trader employees in the c=
oming two weeks.   An analyst said Fallon's appointment indicates future gr=
owth for Enron's bandwidth business.   "I think Fallon is someone who would=
n't be there if it isn't a good opportunity," said Raymond Niles, director =
of power and merchant energy research with Salomon Smith Barney.   In his n=
ew role, Fallon will report to Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive o=
f Enron Wholesale Services, and Greg Whalley, president and chief operating=
 officer of Wholesale Services.   Rice previously reported to Kenneth Lay, =
corporate chairman and chief executive.   Before becoming president of Broa=
dband Services, Fallon was managing director of global trading and risk man=
agement for the unit.   From 1993 to 1999, he worked in Enron North America=
's wholesale energy business rising from the position of associate to manag=
ing director, leading the power trading business.   Before coming to Enron,=
 Fallon was a nuclear operations engineer for General Electric, a systems e=
ngineer at W.R. Grace and a certified public accountant for Price Waterhous=
e.   Fallon earned a bachelor's degree in marine engineering from the Massa=
chusetts Maritime Academy, a master's degree in accounting from Northeaster=
n University and a master's in business administration from Columbia Univer=
sity.   Fallon takes over a unit that lost $102 million in the second quart=
er of this year and is going through a restructuring to reduce losses at th=
e same time bandwidth prices continue to plummet.   -By Erwin Seba, Dow Jon=
