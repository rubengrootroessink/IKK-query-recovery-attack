Hi Chris

Hope all is well with you, Tracy and the kids.  How is Addy (opps, spelling is bound to be wrong)?  Are you coming to the legal conference?  And now for the real reason of my email - Can you send me Tracy's telephone number.  I've been wanting to call her for months and say hi but the stupor got in my mind and I couldn't shake it free. Its a beautiful day here today - the first for months and I'm committing to a new .... well, at least a call to Tracy.  Hope to see you at the legal conference.  Did you hear I have to speak?  At least it is with Klauberg.
