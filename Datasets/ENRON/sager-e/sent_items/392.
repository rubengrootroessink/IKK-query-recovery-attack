I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.

The dealers and some of the customers are ok with an EEI but some important counterparties are anti-EEI.  BPA comes to mind.  Digging in our heels on an EEI-only position might make it difficult to get up and running.  Do you have a view of this?
