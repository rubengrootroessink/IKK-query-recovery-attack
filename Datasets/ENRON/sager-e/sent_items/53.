Thanks Joy - I had emailed Sheryl this am that today only Ella wouldn't need a ride since I'm coming.  I just left her a voice mail as well.  On the bookfair "mistake" I meant to fill in $20 fro books. Oops.  See you this afternoon.

Elizabeth,
I just spoke to Sheryl Rapp.  She didn't know  if she was suppose to take Ella to Brownies or not.  Please confirm with  her on her cell phone 713-859-5950 on way or another.
