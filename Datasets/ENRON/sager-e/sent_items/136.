Subject:=09FW: Set-Off Language

For our call this afternoon.  This is very helpful.  I ta slo sounds compli=
cated, but I think you will se that absent a perfect world, Robert is sugge=
sting only minor changes to the set-off clause previuosly circulated by Mar=
k for EWS trading contracts.  Roberts has also attached more fully develope=
d provisions for both triangular set-off and for square set-off (which woul=
d be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract) which add=
ress the issues of mutuality, privity and consideration in greater detail.

Subject:=09Set-Off Language

  Further to our conversations yesterday and today, I attach the following:

1.  Memorandum of Square Set-Off Combinations;
2.  Memorandum of Triangular Set-Off Combinations;
3.  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision #1, bl=
acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke;
4.  Clean copy of attachment 3;
5.  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions; and
6.  Square Set-Off Provision

This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment.  At your r=
equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading =
Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-O=
ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that w=
ill be enforceable in Canada.  (For the moment, I have considered the laws =
applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner, Kevi=
n McElcheran).

Unlike certain jurisdictions (including, for example, Great Britain), in Ca=
nada  a creditor's set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency.=
  Section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 a=
s amended and section 18.1 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, S.C=
. 1985 c. C-36 as amended, both expressly reserve application of the law of=
 set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply.  Contra=
ctual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid=
ed the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceabl=
e (i.e. has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit=
y and consideration).

Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with=
 an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar=
-for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent=
 company.  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou=
ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off credit=
or to the insolvent company.

The essence of set-off is mutuality: the setting-off of a claim and cross-c=
laim between the same parties.  The difficulty with the expansive set-off t=
erms sought by Enron is that they would permit "set-off" as between Enron a=
nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party.  My concern is th=
at such purported "set-off" is so different in substance from the common no=
tion of set-off which requires mutuality, as to be set-off in name only.  W=
ithout mutuality, I am concerned that a court may not recognize such "set-o=
ff" of obligations relating to third parties as "set-off" within the meanin=
g of Canadian insolvency legislation.  The concern is not only that a court=
 may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven=
t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estate's indebtedness to a cred=
itor.  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor=
ts to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canad=
a.  I am not, however, aware of any case law on point.

With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality, I have=
 incorporated language (referred to in the materials as an "aggregate liabi=
lity clause") to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-c=
laim will be between the same parties.

The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa=
re and triangular set-off.  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure=
 that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim =
and cross-claim.

Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts (att=
achment 3), I have the following comments:

1.    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to b=
e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates.  The reason for this is to avo=
id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e=
xercise inconsistent set-off options.  We must assume that this set-off pro=
vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va=
rious Enron affiliates.  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t=
hese contracts, (or if they contain cross-default provisions,) the Enron af=
filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be "X" under that c=
ontract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder=
 including the right to set-off against amounts it owes, amounts that are o=
wed to any of its affiliates.  Those affiliates may each in turn be "X" und=
er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off ri=
ghts.  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi=
stently in exercising set-off rights, making it clear that the option to se=
t-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates, minimizes any atta=
ck of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the=
 potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off.

2.  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have con=
sideration, I have included an acknowledgement by the parties (including af=
filiates) that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i=
nvolved.  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con=
sideration but is helpful.

3.  Paragraph (B) is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu=
ding an aggregate liability clause, as discussed above.

4.  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co=
ntracts, the changes to the sentence including "limitation to" have been ma=
de to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other=
 rights which X or its affiliates may have.  I was concerned that the "with=
out prejudice" language in the prior draft, would leave it open to the defa=
ulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudi=
ce.

5.  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att=
empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved.  In attach=
ment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is =
not as clear and certain as it might be.  I have also attached a revised tr=
iangular set-off provision (attachment 5) which is clearer, more certain an=
d about one page longer.

Finally, I have included a square set-off provision (attachment 6) which af=
fords Enron (and any non-defaulting counterparty) even better set-off prote=
ction.  As discussed, I will include this provision in the Master, Netting =
Setoff and Security Agreement form.

I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience.

Best Regards
