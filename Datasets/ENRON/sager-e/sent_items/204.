Elizabeth,

After going over the confirmation process with Kim Theriot and getting a
better understanding of that process, we have reworded
our finding as it relates to the confirmation template.  I think at this
point we agree that allowing read only access to the templates is not
beneficial for both groups.  However, we would recommend that legal at
least periodically review the templates (semi-annually or annually)
to ensure the confirmations are proper.  In addition, as an additional
step, have the deal clearing group attach the approval by legal to those
confirmations that require modifications so that an audit trail exists.
Take a look when you have a chance at the attachment below which has the
revised wording for the finding discussed above and get back to me with any
comments or questions.  Thank you.

Mark
