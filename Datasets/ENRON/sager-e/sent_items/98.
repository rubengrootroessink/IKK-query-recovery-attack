Elizabeth,
I just realized, since you weren't on my original roster...you may not be a
HTA member.  If you're not, you will need to pay your dues before you play.
I can fax you a form, and you can mail it in ASAP.  The dues are $10 for an
individual and $12.50 for a family for the Fall League Season (Aug-Dec 2000).
 HTA memberships should be mailed to:
HTA
P.O. Box 79341
Houston, TX  77279-9341
