Hi Ellen 
Just checking to see when the federal estate tax return may be available 
for review.  Also checking to make sure you are also working on the Va 
estate tax return. Thanks

   Elizabeth-  I sent you a letter today.  To summarize, I asked Lou 
   Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley.  I 
   did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be 
   valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days.  Once I have the 
   stock info, I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get 
   them from you before then.  We can deduct on the return any expenses you 
   paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including 
   federal and state income taxes.  Send me a complete list as soon as 
   possible.  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax 
   with the extension.  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible 
   because it is so close to being complete. 
   The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized.  I have 
   re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized.  I 
   don't know why he couldn't let me know that sooner. 
   Ellen

   Hi Ellen 
   I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that 
   have 
   not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, 
   depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will 
   provide 
   you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA 
   probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if 
   necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that 
   right?
