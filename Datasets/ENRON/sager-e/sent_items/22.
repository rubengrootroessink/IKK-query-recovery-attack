Liz-

Hope all is well.  This is a follow up email to the phone message I left you
this morning.

Please see the attached email from Enron's Kimberly Indelicato.  From the
information I have received it appears that this issue has reared its head
because we have asked Enron to sign our EEI confirmation when EKT is the
Seller.  I have looked through our executed EEI and I find no amendment,
addition, deletion, etc.... to Article 2, Transaction Terms and Conditions,
Section 2.3 Confirmation.  EKT believes that it is in compliance with
Section 2.3.  Specifically ..."Seller may confirm a Transaction by
forwarding to Buyer by facsimile within three (3) Business Days after the
Transaction is entered into a confirmation ("Confirmation") substantially in
the form of Exhibit A."

EKT believes it has complied with the requirements of Section 2.3.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Marty
