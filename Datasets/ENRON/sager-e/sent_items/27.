AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.
