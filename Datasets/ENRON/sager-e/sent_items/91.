I looked Ed O up in the directory and he was listed as an EES VP in origination. He told me Mark Taylor told him to call me to get information.  Sound OK? Thanks

elizabeth, we have an Edwin (Ed) Essandoh in EES legal.  Was this intended to go to him?  I do not know who Ed Ondarza is.

Ed

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.

Elizabeth,

I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.

 << File: Index Language Power.doc >> 

The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa
