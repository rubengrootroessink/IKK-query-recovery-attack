(2) Mary Cook redline of Master Netting Agreement, circa 11-6-01, showing what was sheared out when CSA is removed:  


(3) Current Mary Cook from Master Netting Agr with CSA:     
For roadmap as to what has changed since AEP draft roughed out from standard format vintage 11-6-01, see Mary Cook e-mail of late this afternoon, which tracks updateing changes.
