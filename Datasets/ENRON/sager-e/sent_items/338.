Please find enclosed the term sheet for the physical deal we are working on.

The Unit Outage (Gurantee Generation) deal is primarily physical but can be settled financially.

The Stream Flow deal and a standard CDD Call deal is financial only.

Pl call me if you need further information.

 
Thanks,

Sanjeev
