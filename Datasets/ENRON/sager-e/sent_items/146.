Hi Mike

There will be a new document for consideration. Do you think it would be a good idea to see if anybody wants to work on it with us together before the next full meeting?  Hope the rest of you weekend went well.  Talk to you soon.

Should I recirculate the document that you sent to me before or will you have a new document?  I hope to send out documents within a couple of weeks together with an agenda for a meeting.
