Hi Sheryl

I'd love to do the pedicure if still available; Lunch may be a problem, unfortunately

We are still on for 3 at the Houstonian. I have 2 appointments at 4 for
pedicures.  Will either of you be able to make it with me?  If not, I
need to cancel them.  Anyone interested in a late lunch/last minute
christmas shopping around 1:30?
