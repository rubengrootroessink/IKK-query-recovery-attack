Hi, Liz  -

   I am back in Houston after  a  couple of months  in  Europe and Virginia
and  am  starting to look around  for  work post MDCK. If you hear of
anything, I would appreciate  your keeping me in mind. I would most like to
find some sort of  special project  work where I can fill a need  part time
and  get to know some  folks  rather than jumping in head first into a
permanent  spot.If there is anyone  else I should contact who might have
some ideas  I would appreciate hearing  about them as well.If  you have a
chance  , could you send me  Kerry galvin's email address? Iam at  512  653
3063. Thanks. RP
