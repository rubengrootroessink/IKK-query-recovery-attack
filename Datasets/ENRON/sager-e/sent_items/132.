As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.
