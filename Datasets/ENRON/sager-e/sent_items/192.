Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty Jo
Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group session
next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.  All
you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it is a
boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can discreetly
give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER THAN
THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per person
would be plenty.

Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
questions.

Thanks!

Shari
