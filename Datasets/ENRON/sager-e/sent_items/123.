Hi Elizabeth,

I am following up a case that Global Risk Markets was working on about 3 months ago.  I believe it is called Deacero located in Mexico.  It was a power sale agreement and I think Bob Carter was working on the case while he was still with Enron.  We wanted to know what the status of the case was and who is now handling Bob's responsibilities. 

Thanks for your time,
