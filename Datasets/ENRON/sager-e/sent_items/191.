Hi Shari
No problem rescheduling lunch.
I'd be happy to drive out of downtown for EEI (assuming I can go - Grant may be traveling some)
Looking forward to Colorado most but also EEI (and I will be there).
Talk to you soon.

   Subject:  Shhhh.... it's a SURPRISE !

   Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty
   Jo
   Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group
   session
   next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.
   All
   you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
   someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

   Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
   You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it
   is a
   boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can
   discreetly
   give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER
   THAN
   THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per
   person
   would be plenty.

   Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
   questions.

   Thanks!

   Shari
