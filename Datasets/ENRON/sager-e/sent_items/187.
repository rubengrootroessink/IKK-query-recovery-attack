This communication is CONFIDENTIAL
and protected by the ATTORNEY-CLIENT
and WORK PRODUCT privileges.


     In response to the ERCOT market transition, and the fact that "UB" is
no longer an accurate ERCOT product description, on a going forward basis,
unless otherwise specifically instructed by the Trade Floor or the
Origination Group, please identify ERCOT products as "Firm-LD" [as defined
under Schedule P of the EEI Agreement] (obviously, if we have an EEI in
place with a counterparty the bracketed part is not necessary, but if not,
it needs to be included).  Under the "Delivery Point" heading please state:
"Seller's choice of any available interface(s) within the ERCOT control
area."  I will let you know if/when any of this changes.  In the meantime,
refer any customer response to this confirmation change to the Trade Floor
and/or Legal.

     Thank you.

P.S.  To John Ritch: Please let me know if this is OK or if you want to
change it in any way.  If OK, please forward this to your traders.
