Hi Peter

Here is a draft form of officers certificate for your review.  As we discussed, I wanted to get you something to look at as soon as possible.  With the holidays upon us, I still have not been able to clear this through all of the necessary channels but will continue to try.  Call with any questions/comments. Thanks
