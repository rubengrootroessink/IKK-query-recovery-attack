I still have not received a package from you and am wondering if there's any problem that we need to address.  Please advise.  Thanks.

   Hi 
   Just wondering if you got the package I sent via FedEx last week and had 
   had a chance to get the letters signed. 
   I heard that you got more reinforcements recently (Travis and Kaye), and 
   I hope that things continue to go well there. 
   Regards, Janice
