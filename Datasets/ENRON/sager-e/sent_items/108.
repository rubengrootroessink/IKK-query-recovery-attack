Great - go ahead and overnight to my home (I'm assuming email is unavailable?).  Check it for early delivery and tell carrier service to leave on porch if nobody is home.  My home address is 822 Columbia Street, Houston Tx., 77007. Thanks

Elizabeth-  the figures arrived yesterday after my e-mail to you.  Would you like me to overnight the draft of the return?  If so, to home or office?
