The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat .... on your trip ...... tomorrow.   It really is cold you know.  
My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient)

Elizabeth:  sounds good for Wednesday.  Does something in the 12:30 range sound OK for you?  As of right now, I am planning to fly down Wed. a.m. so that should be pretty safe.  I heard you were tied up all weekend in the Wimbledon doubles matches--is that true?  John
