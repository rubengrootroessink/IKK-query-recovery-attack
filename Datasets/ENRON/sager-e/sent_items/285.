Thanks for the words - given my week, my month, my year, I need all the reminders I can to refocus and prioritize.  Hope all is well with you.

TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY:
(Written by Andy Rooney ..................................., BUT FROM ME!)

I've learned....That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an
elderly person.

I've learned....That when you're in love, it shows.

I've learned....That just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!"
makes my day.

I've learned....That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the
most peaceful feelings in the world.

I've learned....That being kind is more important than being right.

I've learned....That you should never say no to a gift from a child.

I've learned....That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the
strength to help him in some other way.

I've learned....That no matter how serious your life requires you to be,
everyone needs a friend to act goofy with.

I've learned....That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a
heart to understand.

I've learned....That simple walks with my father around the block on summer
nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets
to the end, the faster it goes.

I've learned....That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask
for.

I've learned....That money doesn't buy class.

I've learned....That it's those small daily happenings that make life so
spectacular.

I've learned...That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be
appreciated and loved.

I've learned....That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me
think I can?

I've learned.... That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.

I've learned....That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only
letting that person continue to hurt you.

I've learned....That love, not time, heals all wounds.

I've learned....That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to
surround myself with people smarter than I am.

I've learned....That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.

I've learned....That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies
and feeling their breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.

I've learned....That life is tough, but I'm tougher.

I've learned....That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the
ones you miss.

I've learned....That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock
elsewhere.

I've learned....That I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one
more time before she passed away.

I've learned....That one should keep his words both soft and tender because
tomorrow he may have to eat them.

I've learned....That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.

I've learned....That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do
about it.

I've learned....That when your newly born grandchild holds your little
finger in his little fist, that you're hooked for life.

I've learned....That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all
the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.

I've learned....That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances;
when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.

I've learned....That the less time I have to work with, the more things I
get done.

I've learned....Friends are very rare jewels, indeed.  They make you smile
and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share words of praise
and they always want to open their hearts to us.


It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care.  Send
this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to
the person who sent it to you.  If it comes back to you, then you'll know
you have a circle of friends.

HAPPY FRIENDSHIP WEEK!  YOU ARE MY FRIEND,  I AM YOURS, AND I AM DEEPLY
HONORED!
