Hi Alex

Thanks for your messages.  We just got back from  10 days in Colorado (celebrating the big 40 of course) and had a great time.  I would love to get together on the weekend of the 18th ( I don't work Fridays so maybe I could drive up or something).  I'll be out alot next week - I have to go back to Co for work and Grant and I are going to stay the weekend but we will be back on the 12th.  Let me know if you find a place ... I'll also be thinking.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Liz! 
I am going to be in Dallas from Wed. August 15 through Wed. August 22 and thought we could get together 
on the weekend. I have this crazy idea that maybe you could get away- meet me on Friday and we could go to a spa/ 
ranch/yoga center somewhere outside Dallas for Friday and Saturday....I'm looking into an a place.. What do you think??
