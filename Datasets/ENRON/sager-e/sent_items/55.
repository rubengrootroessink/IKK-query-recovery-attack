Susan,
  
  Thank you for all of the documents.  I am expecting that we will be able to turn another draft out tomorrow (Tuesday) but I do want Sam to see it before it goes out and I have not made contact with him today (Monday).  I will touch base with you again tomorrow on timing.  I am using very little of the original draft and instead, am using almost everything that you sent to us.

  The outline of notes from Alan and Mike that you sent to me seemed to reference Mike Roan's comments.  I have the ouline with Alan's comments and their joint outline but I do not have a stand alone document for Mike Roan. 
I
  will work with what I have but if you do have a separate document from Mike and want me to use it, could you please send it to me if you  have a free minute?  The other material from Alan and Mike seems helpful.  

Thanks very much,

Cathy

Attached are:

1.  The outline I e-mailed you previously, with Alan Comnes' comments.
Basically Alan has added a Section II, which arguably could be
incorporated into Section IV of the previous outline.  

2.  An outline of some notes from Alan Comnes and Mike Roan (both
economists).  Some of these points may be useful to add; please do so at
your discretion.

3.  EPSA's draft comments for your information (could not remember
whether I had forwarded them to you).
