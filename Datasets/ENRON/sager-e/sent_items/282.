I understand that the Broadmoor is sold out for the night of the 9th, including the block of rooms held for the WSPP Contracting Meeting.  There is a waiting list, but the waiting list is long.  Here is a list of alternate hotels/resorts in the area, the hotels/resorts have been checked and they do have rooms available:

Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort  (2.5 miles away from Broadmoor)
3225 Broadmoor Valley Road
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-538-4000

Doubletree World Arena       (3 miles from Broadmoor)
1775 E. Cheyenne Mountain Boulevard
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-576-8900

Sheraton Colorado Springs Hotel     (3 miles from Broadmoor)
2886 South Circle Drive
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-576-5900

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but when the arrangements were made for the meeting, there were plenty of rooms available at that time.
