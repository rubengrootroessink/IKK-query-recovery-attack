Hi John

Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate  mom's IRA into 3 accounts.  Can you email me your SS#.  Thanks

Hi, Liz.   Mom's car is being worked on this week, and I should get it back
tomorrow.  It will probably take me another month or two to get it licensed
in Maryland, because I don't want to take a day off from work to deal with
it.  I wonder if you would please start thinking of some system for
disbursing property from the estate.  Figuring out what to do with the car
has been more than vaguely troubling to me, and I think I figured out the
major reason why.  There are some X number of items of property in the
estate that need to be dealt with.   Each of us will likely want to keep
some and not care about others.  Some of them will likely need to be valued
within the estate, and some of them we can probably disburse informally and
outside of the estate.  How do you want to divide these things up?  The car
just seems to be the first of these things that we need to deal with,
because it costs money to maintain.   Shall we have a lottery for all of
the personal property items?  Shall we sell everything and disburse cash?
Or shall we do something in between?  I would like to deal with the car in
the context of everything else.  I do need a new car at some point soon,
but there is nothing sentimental to me about that car  that would make me
want to keep it (except that it is a convertible, which I could not justify
buying for myself at this point) unless I get it for below market value,
which would not be fair to you or Chi.   The blue book value of the car is
only about $2000, I think, at which price I would probably choose to keep
it until my legal fees are done with and I know where I stand financially.
It is possible we could sell it for $4000 - 5000, but I don't know.   I
know I would not pay $4000 for it.

Looking down the road, I know I think about wanting to improve Andrew's
room, and I think about wanting one of the chest of drawer's that are at
Bob's house.  This is probably sentimental, because I don't think Andrew
will care anytime soon, but, in any case, I don't know what the things are
worth.  I do know that I would like to have a system in place where I don't
need to worry too much about what dollar value we each think something is
worth.
