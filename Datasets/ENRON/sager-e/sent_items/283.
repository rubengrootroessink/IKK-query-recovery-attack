Thanks for the reminder - I have calls into Bill/Michael but .... no thoughts yet.  Lisa seems to think PG&E has lost motivation to do anything.

Elizabeth:

I assume that you may have already handled this, but just in case I thought I would remind you that the expiration date under the existing standstill agreement is June 20th.  My general sense is that I thought we probably would want to extend it, at least once to see if any type of deal is possible.  Is that the current thinking?

I assume that your groundstrokes are pretty powerful now since you have been practicing for a few days with very haeavy and soggy tennis balls.  In all seriousness, I hope that you made it through the weekend ok.

Let me know if you want to follow up.  I am looking for a "doctor's note" to escape from Sithe.

John
