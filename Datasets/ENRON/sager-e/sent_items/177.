Meeting Attendees:

For those who were planning to join us for dinner on the night of the 7th, the location of the restaurant HAS CHANGED to MAGGIANO'S LITTLE ITALY,  2019 South Post Oak Blvd. Houston, TX 77056  713-961-2700.  It's between Westheimer and San Felipe (see map attached).  I've made a reservation in a private room there for 20 at 6:30pm, based on contact from those who had previously indicated they were joining us.  Please check the attached attendance roster to make sure my list of those who are attending the dinner (and the meetings) is  correct.  If you are not listed and would like to join us please let Nina Tillett at Reliant know by COB Monday (her email is nina.tillett@reliant.com - please note I had an incorrect email for her previously).  Also note that continental breakfast and lunch will be provided at both meetings.

Also, please find attached the following:
