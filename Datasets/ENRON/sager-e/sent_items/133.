   Subject:  RTO Implications

   Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some
   of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss
   the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale
   commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on
   Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m.
   (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John
   LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a
   very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The
   other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES
   and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to
   proceed.  Thanks.  John
