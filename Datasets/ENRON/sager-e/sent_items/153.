Hi Cindy

I can't play this week but anytime next week would work.  Also, I have a friend coming in on Sat so I can't play this Sat but after that I would be interested in hitting on Sat am.  Thanks

Is anyone interested in playing tennis this week or weekend?  Let me know
what day or days are good for you.  Also, my USTA team is going to Nationals
in October.  We will be practicing on Saturdays at 10:00am @ Lee LeClear,
would any of you be interested in practicing with us?
