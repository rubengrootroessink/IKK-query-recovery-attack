I would like to get back to Derek on his trip to Houston last week.  We (Canada) have signed off, including commercial approval from Milnthorp and Cross, subject to satisfactory interviews in Houston.  Note:  Jim Derrick was not available but have scheduled May 25 to send Derek back to Houston to meet with Jim.  Peter.
