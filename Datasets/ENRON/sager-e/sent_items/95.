Bill

Are you talking to PG&E about post petition power invoice?  I understand the Canadian receivable post petition was paid.  Is that right?  Give me a call when you get a chance.

Melissa,

On yesterday, Bob Caden and Dave Cena called and left messages about invoice #NTP010905.  They both said that this invoice is tied up with other invoices that are currently being discussed with Bill Bradford.  They both suggested that you give Bill Bradford a call.  Also, Dave Cena said that if you would like to speak to someone at PG&E, you can give him a call at (415) 973-4144.

Thanks
