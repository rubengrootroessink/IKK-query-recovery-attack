Elizabeth,

In his absence, Christian asked me to prepare long-form WSPP confirms to govern existing transactions between EPMI and the above counterparties.  While we are also working on EEI agreements with these counterparties, existing credit exposure is high and Tracy Ngo has requested that we move forward with the WSPP confirms as a stop-gap measure.  I would like to run the confirms by you for approval early next week before sending them to the counterparties.  Let me know if this works for you.

Feel free to contact me by email or phone at (503) 294-9829.

Justin
