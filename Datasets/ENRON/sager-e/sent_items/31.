Hi Joy
 
I RSVP'd yes to this but did not know of the about Indian Princesses schedule- Ella and Grant will be out of town on the 20th so will not be able to make the Scouting for Food event. Sorry.  Thanks and talk to you soon.

Subject: Brownies! - Scouting for Food




Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a "Scouting for Food" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy
