All:  Attached below is Enron's attorney's revsion of my draft letter
agreement, which, in my view, is execution-ready.  This letter has not yet
been reviewed by EPMI, however, and there may be additional changes from
them.  Please let me know by cob today if you have concerns or suggested
revisions; I'd like to get Roy's signature early tomorrow--if Enron has no
additional comments or revisions to offer.  Thanks.  Larry
