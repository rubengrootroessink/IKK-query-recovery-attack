Hi Dave  
Here is a revised draft for discussion purposes only of the MNA, marked to show changes from the prior draft of 11/8.  In order to get this to you for your review as soon as possible, I am by copy of this email sending drafts to others in Enron's legal, credit and commercial groups for their first review;  accordingly, there likely will be additional changes based upon their review.  Please call if you have any questions or comments. Thanks
Elizabeth Sager
