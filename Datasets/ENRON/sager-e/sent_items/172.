Ellen

We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.  Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?
Thanks

Elizabeth-  I got the statements you sent me and it looks like the value of some or all of the stock went down in between December and June.  Were any of the securities in the accounts sold or have you just held onto everything?  If its OK with you, I would like to call Louis Alexander at Morgan Stanley and ask him to prepare a formal appraisal of the securities as of December 31 and June 30.  He might be able to do this without charge since the accounts are at Morgan Stanley.  Let me know.
