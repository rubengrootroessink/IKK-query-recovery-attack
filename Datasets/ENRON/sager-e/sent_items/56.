Elizabeth,
    Hello! Sorry I couldn't get back with you last night. I was at a dinner and got home a little too late to call.
    As it turns out, I will be helping with Brownies today also so I'll pick up Anna at car pool. If you'd like me to pick up Ella, just let me know at work before ~2:30 (713 745-0678 or vhuff@mdacc.tmc.edu --  but not this home email address). The carpool number is 349.
    See you at the sit-upon workshop!
Vicki
