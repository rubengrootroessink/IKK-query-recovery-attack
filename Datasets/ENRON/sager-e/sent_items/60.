You are playing Line 3 at 8:15.  The park (Oaks of Woodlake) is on the corner
of Ella Lee and Tanglewilde.   Ella Lee is one block north of Westheimer
(Between Briar Forest and Westheimer).  And Tanglewilde is one block east of
Gessner.  Park on the Tanglewilde side (there is a small parking lot or you
can park on the street).  Please bring water.  They have a water fountain,
but no ice.   I'm sorry you have to keep playing the late match, but that's
the way the lines keep working out.  I won't be playing, so would it be
possible for you to keep the scoresheet?  You can sign as captain, and I'll
just get the scoresheet from you when I see you.  Maureen Garrett will be
playing Line 4 at 7:00pm, and she can show you how the scoresheet works if
you have any questions.  Thanks a lot!
