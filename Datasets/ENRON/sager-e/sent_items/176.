Hi Cindy

My name is Elizabeth Sager and I work with Carol St Clair at Enron. She and I play tennis periodically and she said that you may be looking for players for a 4.5 singles league at Memorial on Wed nights.  If you need players, I would be interested in playing.  I'm traveling most of this week and out for the weekend but if you still need players let me know - if you want we could arrange a time to hit.  Thanks - talk to you soon.
