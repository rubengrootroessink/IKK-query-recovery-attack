Subject:	Availability for Conference Call


To All:
 
Please let me know your availability for a conference call  next week on 10/1-10/3 or 10/5 at 2pm Eastern TIme to discuss the  following:
 
1) Getting a EEI Contract Working Group organizational plan in  place asap.  The best antidote for preventing an Energy Industry Standards  Board from taking over the EEI Contract management is to have a separate,  well-defined and broadly-supported group in place.
 
3) Agenda and schedule for the next meeting of the Working  Group.
 
3) Adding new members to the drafting committe.  In  particular, Noel Trask of the Excelon Power Team has asked to join.
 
ASAP, I would like to get the optional provisions  circulated earlier this week up on the website and through the listserver   along w/ the announcement of our organizational proposal and future working  group meetings.
 
Thanks.
