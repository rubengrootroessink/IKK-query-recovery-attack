HI Dede

Hope your July went great and now that it's August  ...  ready to play tennis any time this week ( I strained my back right after you left but its all better now and ready for action)? swim on Sunday (again I haven't swum since we did but everyday day is new day for a lifetime commitment or at least another try).  Talk to you soon.
