Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks
