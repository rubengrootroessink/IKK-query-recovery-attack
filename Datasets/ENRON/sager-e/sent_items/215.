Subject:	Updated Agenda

Hello Mark -- I have attached an updated agenda with a minor adjustment:
Emerging Market Forms is changed to Developing Products Market Forms to
better flow with the Committee focus on developing products with an
additional focus on weather derivatives and bandwidth.  This also appears to
be the appropriate place to explore the need to update ISDA's Commodity
Definitions.

Unless you have any objections or additional thoughts I'll go ahead and
issue this agenda with the invitation tomorrow.
