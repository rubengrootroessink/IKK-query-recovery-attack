Subject:	LSI Conference:  Energy Restructuring in the Southwest

Elizabeth,
Hi!  Next month LSI is holding a conference on restructuring in the Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico).  I would like to attend.  Would Enron pay for my tuition and travel expenses?  The cost of the seminar is $397. 
The conference is July 19 and 20 (Thursday and Friday).  Christian will be on vacation that week, but he said that he thought it would be fine if I went as long as I was available by cell phone.
Steve



ENERGY RESTRUCTURING IN THE SOUTHWEST

July 19 & 20, 2001
Las Vegas, Nevada
Alexis Park Resort
A B O U T T H E C O N F E R E N C E

"In the wake of California's energy market turbulence during the past summer and the subsequent state of emergency beginning in January 2001, states throughout the Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies regarding restructuring of the electric utility industry. This has resulted in ever changing and frequently confusing laws and policies affecting utilities, energy service providers and customers in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. This conference will help lay the groundwork for energy professionals from all sectors to better understand current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will shape the markets of the future."

Program Co-Chairs: Arthur O'Donnell and Fred Schmidt, Esq.

Who Should Attend? Lawyers, producers, public and private distributors, customers, brokers, regulatory agencies and anyone else involved in the area's economic development
