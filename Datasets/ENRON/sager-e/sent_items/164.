Hi
thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w C=
Y.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the=
 WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought=
, rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  =
How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion,=
 but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

Elizabeth:

The EEI cover sheet defines West Firm as follows:  "West Firm" means with r=
espect to a Transaction, a Product that is or will be scheduled as firm ene=
rgy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the WSCC for which the=
 only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (=
i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agr=
eement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statut=
ory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in t=
his Agreement, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its publi=
c utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment=
 of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Article 4 of =
this Agreement. =20

EnronOnline defines "West Firm" as "power that is or will be scheduled as f=
irm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Sys=
tems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver=
 or receive are if an interruption is (i) (a) due to an Uncontrollable Forc=
e as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement if the WSPP Agreement gov=
erns this transaction or (b) due to an event of force majeure as such term =
is defined under such other agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that=
 governs this transaction (the "Agreement"); or (ii) where applicable, to m=
eet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Not=
withstanding any other provision in the WSPP Agreement or the Agreement, if=
 applicable, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public =
utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment o=
f damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Section 21.3 of=
 the WSPP Agreement, if applicable, or as provided in the applicable cover =
remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  "WSPP Agreement" means the Western Sys=
tem Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.

I wanted to confirm that I should revise the EOL description to delete the =
hilited language.  Please advise.
