Hi Amy
Sounds great - I just need to make sure my husband can stay home with the kids. I'll email you after he calls me back.  Talk to you soon.

Liz,
Enjoyed playing tennis last week and Hope you are doing o.k.  Wanted to see
if you wanted to play tennis Thursday night in a mini-singles round-robin
at Memorial Park 7:00pm.
Let me know!
Thanks,
