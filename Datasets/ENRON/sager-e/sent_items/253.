Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).

 Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?
