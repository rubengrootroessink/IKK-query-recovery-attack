Subject: Revised documents



Attached are revised versions of the Second Amendment to the Master Netting

Agreement (with a blacklined copy) reflecting my comments on Lisa's draft

and Robert's comments, a revised version of the Security Agreement (with a

blacklined copy) incorporating Lisa's comments, and a Ratification of

Guaranty for each of the guaranties.

Please note that David Burns has not had an opportunity to review these

revised documents and may have some comments tomorrow morning.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713.229.1191.
