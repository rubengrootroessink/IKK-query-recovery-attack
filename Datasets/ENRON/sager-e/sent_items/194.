Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000

ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes =
that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarte=
rly market-based sales of electric energy is no longer the most effective m=
eans of meeting the requirements of the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Instead, =
this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which i=
s both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commis=
sion proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would=
 no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-bas=
ed sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applica=
ble services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the pu=
blic utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarter=
ly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of po=
wer at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each publi=
c utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its web=
site an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms=
 and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (=
market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service)=
; and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based=
 power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar qua=
rter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wis=
hes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services su=
ch as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise=
 its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those servi=
ces.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplifi=
cation of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.
