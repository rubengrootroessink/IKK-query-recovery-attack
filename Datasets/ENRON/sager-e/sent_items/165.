Harlan and I have discussed the issue.  For all long-form confirms, EOL and over-the-counter, please describe the commodity as follows:  Firm (LD) Energy, consistent with the terms of the "Firm (LD)" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00) including without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation attached as Annex A.

With the change to the commodity description to make clear that the Schedule P definition of Firm (LD) trumps the GTCs, we do not need to revise the GTCs at this point.  (I am updating the GTCs to conform to the EEI and will let you know as soon as the new version is ready for roll-out in the confirmation process.)

Leslie

Harlan,

Can you advise on the template?  Liz said you would also be working in ERCOT along with David.

Leslie,

Can you advise Sharen on the EOL GTC?

Thanks,
Genia

David Portz indicated that the long form would need to be modified to accept the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals that need to be confirmed on the long form with an ERCOT delivery point.  Can someone take a look at these and tell us what needs to be done, or do we send them out as is for now.

In addition, does the EOL GTC need to be modified to accommodate the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals to be confirmed on the EOL GTC in the ERCOT delivery points.

Thanks!
