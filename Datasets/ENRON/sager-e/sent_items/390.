Dear Ms. Sager,
 
This is one of the attendance of EEI Power Marketing Transactions workshop  on April 18, 19.  
Thank you for your presentation, it was very helpful to me and I  really enjoyed it.
I asked you to send me the documents of your presentation ( your first  presentation on April 18) 
by mail or e-mail, and you said you would do that.
I know you are so busy, but if it's possible, would you kindly  send them by mail or e-mail below?
I look forward to your kind reply.
 
Sincerely,
 
Kazue Tabo
