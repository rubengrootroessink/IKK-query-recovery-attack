Nothing to date has been communicated to PGE re settlement.  I'll keep you posted (that's a joke).

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John
