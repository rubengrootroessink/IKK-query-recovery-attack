Dear Pastor,

For the last few weeks I have been under all type of excessive work related stress.  I try not to bring any home but this last weekend I was at my wits end and it my family noticed my change.  The more I thought about my situation the more uptight I got.  I didn't know whether to quit or trudge on.

Then came Sunday morning.  I got to my 4 year old class and the troubles were all absent from my mind.  Teaching those kids got my mind off of all the troubles.  I got into the sanctuary and the first words of your sermon, concerning people with problems, were directed right at me.  In a matter of moments I realized I had been trying to deal with these situations on my own, asking no help from the Lord.  In an instant all my stresses were lifted completely.  It is so wonderful the way the Lord works.  He had you plan a sermon that was timed perfectly for the moment I could take the mess at work no longer.

The rest of my day was great!

I came into work this morning and some of the things that were causing stress turned around for the better.

The Lord is great at reminding us who is in charge at all times.

This is not the first time a sermon was perfectly timed.  Just after you joined us, one of your sermons was just what I needed to hear when I was at my wits end.

Thanks for a great sermon and hallelujah to the Lord for watching over his flock.

Sincerely,

Tom Donohoe
