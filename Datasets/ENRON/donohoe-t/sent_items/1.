I requested some birth certificates about 3 weeks ago.  Can you tell me if the request has been processed.  I faxed in the request with my credit card number.  The transmission came back that you received the request.

The request was for William Monroe Donohoe (3/14/96) and Claire Louise Donohoe(5/18/98).

They were to be mailed to Thomas C. Donohoe at
		4702 Gladesdale Park Lane
		Katy, TX  77450

Please call me at 713-853-7151 if there are any questions .

Sincerely,

Tom Donohoe
