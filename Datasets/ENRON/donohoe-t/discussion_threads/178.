Announcing Initiatives to Increase Domestic Energy Production
The Director of the Minerals Management Service, Walt Rosenbusch, announced=
=20
today several initiatives to increase domestic natural gas and oil producti=
on=20
to meet the nation=01,s energy needs. These initiatives are proposed for th=
e=20
next offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Central Gulf of Mexico schedule=
d=20
for March 28, 2001. The announcement came as part of the issuance of a=20
proposed notice of sale for Sale 178 in today=01,s Federal Register.
MMS designed two of these initiatives specifically to spur domestic natural=
=20
gas production during the years 2004-2006. Director Rosenbusch called the=
=20
changes "strong initiatives on the part of the MMS to deal with the large=
=20
projected increase in gas demand for the nation. Several studies, including=
=20
the report issued by the National Petroleum Council, indicate that the=20
nation's demand for natural gas will grow from the current 22 trillion cubi=
c=20
feet (TCF) of gas to 29 TCF of gas in 2010. These initiatives may contribut=
e=20
additional gas production, in the range of 500 billion to 1 TCF per year in=
=20
the period 2004 to 2006."
Rosenbusch noted that "there are predictions of serious shortages of natura=
l=20
gas this winter, including the northeast U.S. There have already been sever=
al=20
brownouts across the country this year because of the demands on electrical=
=20
production."
Included in the proposed notice are two initiatives for increasing natural=
=20
gas production:
? An incentive to drill for deep gas deposits located in the shallow-water=
=20
shelf area of the Gulf of Mexico by providing for royalty suspension for th=
e=20
first 20 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of production from a well drilled below=
=20
15,000 feet sea level.=20
? An incentive to drill for natural gas below the thick subsalt domes. MMS=
=20
proposes that lessees obtain a 2-year extension of the 5-year primary lease=
=20
term when an operator has drilled a first subsalt well and needs additional=
=20
time to image the subsurface data to determine the appropriate next drillin=
g=20
target. This will avoid premature lease expiration and the consequent delay=
=20
in exploration.=20
In addition, MMS proposes modified initiatives for deep water royalty relie=
f:
? An incentive to keep exploring and developing oil and gas deposits in the=
=20
ultra deepwater areas to replace the expiring provisions of the 1995=20
Deepwater Royalty Relief Act. A royalty suspension volume of nine million=
=20
barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is proposed for water depths from 800 meter=
s=20
to 1,599 meters, and a royalty suspension volume of the first 12 million BO=
E=20
in water depths equal to or greater than 1,600 meters.=20
? An opportunity to apply for additional "discretionary" royalty relief,=20
pursuant to new proposed rulemaking, if certain conditions are satisfied.=
=20
MMS will conduct public workshops to discuss the new provisions announced i=
n=20
the proposed notice of sale, as well as provisions of the proposed rule (65=
=20
FR 69259 published November 16), regarding discretionary royalty relief for=
=20
leases in water depths of 200 meters and greater. Details about the worksho=
ps=20
that will be held this December in New Orleans and Houston will be released=
=20
today.
Proposed Sale 178 encompasses about 4,366 available blocks in the Central=
=20
Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf planning area offshore Louisiana,=20
Mississippi, and Alabama. This area covers about 23.07 million acres. Block=
s=20
in this sale are located from three to 200 miles offshore in water depths=
=20
ranging from four to more than 3,425 meters. Estimates of undiscovered=20
economically recoverable hydrocarbons expected to be discovered and produce=
d=20
as a result of this sale proposal range from 150 to 440 million barrels of=
=20
oil and 1.53 to 4.39 TCF of natural gas.
MMS is the federal agency that manages the nation's natural gas, oil and=20
other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The agency also=20
collects, accounts for and disburses over $5 billion per year in revenues=
=20
from federal offshore mineral leases and from onshore mineral leases on=20
federal and Indian lands.
