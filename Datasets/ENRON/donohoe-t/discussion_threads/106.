																Total to Build Deep-Water Gulf of 
																Mexico Gathering System
																
																
																? ? TotalFinaElf plans to construct a natural gas  gathering project with its 
north American partners in the Gulf of  Mexico, enabling the development of 
three deep offshore natural gas  fields. The project consisted of a 56-mile 
pipeline with a  transmission capacity of 500 MMcf per day and a processing 
platform,  owned and operated by Williams.? Construction of the Canyon  
Express pipeline, in the Mississippi Canyon area about 120 miles  southeast 
of New Orleans, will begin next year. The gathering system  will begin 
operating in summer 2002, at the same time as the three  natural gas fields, 
Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden Hills. Canyon  Express was a major 
technological breakthrough for TotalFinaElf,  making it possible to undertake 
oil and natural gas operations at  previously untapped depths of over 6,000 
feet. The gas gathering  system will be operated by Elf Exploration and 
belong to the  companies who owned the Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden 
Hills  fields. Aconcagua is operated by Elf Exploration which has a 50%  
stake in the field. Enron affiliate, Mariner Energy, and Pioneer  Natural 
Resources each own 25%. King's Peak is wholly-owned and  operated by BP 
Amoco. Camden Hills is operated by Marathon, with a  50% stake. Total 
Exploration Production USA owns 16.67% and Pioneer  owns 33.3%. Aconcagua 
will own 45%; King's Peak, 35%; and Camden  Hills 20% of the Canyon Express 
pipeline.

																													undeveloped  frontier areas, he said. The highway route is being promoted by  
Foothills Pipe Lines while Arctic Resources is promoting the  Beaufort Sea 
route. The North Slope has natural gas reserves of over  35 Tcf, and many 
believe the potential reserves could exceed 100  Tcf. Currently, oil 
producers produce about 8 MMcf per day of  natural gas and re-inject almost 
all of it into oil reservoirs to  build up pressure there and enhance future 
recovery.
