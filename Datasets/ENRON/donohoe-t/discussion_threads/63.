																												financial  strength and keep up with the 3%annual growth in Wisconsin's  
electricity demand. The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to  build at 
least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and  at least two 600 
MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a  total of 1,700 MW. More 
units may be built after 2010, eventually  raising new generation capacity in 
the state to around 3,000 MW.  Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to 
the state's power grid  by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 
kilovolt  transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line  
would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North  Dakota, 
easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south.  Wisconsin imports up 
to 20% of its power.

																														Demand Exceeds BPA Supply BPA 
																														
																														? ? Customer demand under new 10-year wholesale  power contracts with the BPA 
is so strong that the agency must  purchase power on the open market to 
augment its supply. To recover  the cost of these purchases, it proposes to 
tack a 15% charge onto  wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an 
additional  charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale 
market  prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast.  
BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130  Northwest 
utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements  pushed its total 
firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is  almost 3000 MW more than the 
federal Columbia River Power System can  generate on a firm basis.
