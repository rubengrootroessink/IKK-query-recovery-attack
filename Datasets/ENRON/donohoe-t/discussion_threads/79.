																								AEC  Sole Owner of Express Pipeline 
																								
																								
																								
																								?  ? Standard & Poor's has issued a CreditWatch update  indicating that the 
rating on the $146.6 million senior secured  notes issued by the Express 
pipeline project could be adversely  affected. AEC has exercised its option 
for the purchase of  TransCanada's 50% interest in the Express Pipeline 
Project and  Marquest, a marketing vehicle directly and indirectly owned 
equally  by AEC and TransCanada. The project is a 1,717-mile-long pipeline  
that runs from Hardisty, Alberta to Wood River, Illinois.
