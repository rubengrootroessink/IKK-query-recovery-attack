																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.
