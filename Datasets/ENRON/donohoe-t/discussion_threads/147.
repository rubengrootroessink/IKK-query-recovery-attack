Tom,
I politely advised the lady with Spinnaker that she needs to get me the 
changes by 10:30 or I would have to make the change the following day.
Just a FYI....they called at 11:15 and just Emailed it to me.
Mark

This is to request that Spinnaker increase their nomination effective as
soon as possible from the current 9,100 to 12,600.  A spreadsheet is
attached showing the figures and method used to determine the requested
rate.  I will continue to monitor the well(s) daily for rate changes and
will advise of required changes in noms.

Please advise when you have increased your nom and the effective date -
either by e-mail or telephone (direct line 337/272-7403).  Thank you for
your cooperation in this effort to maintain a balance between noms and
delivery.
