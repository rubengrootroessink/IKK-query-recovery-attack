																													Alberta's Oil and Natural? Gas Revenue Doubles  
																													
																													
																													
																													?  ? Alberta's revenue from oil and natural gas will more than  double this 
year to about C$8.7 billion. It will use most of the  money to cut its debt. 
Alberta, the biggest international supplier  of natural gas to the US, will 
pay down its debt by C$4.5 billion  this year and give residents C$485 
million in tax and energy-bill  rebates. Alberta is expecting a C$4.2 billion 
budget surplus in the  fiscal year ending March 31. Alberta collects a 
percentage of  revenue from oil and natural gas produced in the province. 
The  province's debt, now around C$12.5 billion, rose when prices were  low. 
Alberta's low debt and its repayment program have earned it the  highest 
credit rating of any Canadian province.

																														Canadian 88 Losses Increase
																														
																														? 
																														
																														?  ? Canadian 88 Energy, which has put itself up for sale, says  its third 
quarter loss widened seven-fold because of production  problems and an 
ill-fated natural gas hedging program. It reported  the loss grew to C$5.2 
million. Cash flow, a key indicator a firm's  ability to fund future 
exploration, fell 64% to C$2.3 million from  C$6.4 million. The third quarter 
results reflected the one-time  impact of the upgrading program at the Olds 
Gas Plant, which  shut-in? 26 MMcf per day of natural gas and 770 barrels of  
liquids daily from September 5th until October 7th. Most Canadian  firms have 
been big winners in the natural gas market, but not  Canadian 88, whose 
natural gas hedging reduced cash flow by $26  million in the quarter.
