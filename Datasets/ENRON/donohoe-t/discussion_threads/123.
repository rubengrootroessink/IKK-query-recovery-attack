																																	Consultant Says Mexico to Pay Billions for Natural Gas  
																																	
																																	
																																	? ?  Mexico, over the next decade, will likely need to spend $40.6  Billion 
to import natural gas, given Pemex's failure to conduct  adequate capital 
investment, consultants Consultores Internacionales  have said in a report. 
The estimate assumes an average price for  natural gas of $4.50 per MMBtu 
over the period. In a more  conservative scenario, with the average price of 
natural gas at  $3.50 per MMBtu, the country over the next 10 years would 
need to  spend $31.6 billion dollars on natural gas imports, according to 
the  report. Under both scenarios, estimates expect that Mexico will need  to 
import 24.7 Bcf of natural gas during the coming decade.

																																				September Canadian Natural Gas Sales
																																				
																																				
																																				Natural gas sales totaled 4.22 billion cubic meters in  September, up 10.2% 
over September 1999. The increase was the result  of increased demand by the 
industrial and residential sectors. Use  by the industrial sector rose 11.7%, 
amid higher use of natural gas  for electricity generation and stronger 
demand by the chemical  industry. Year-to-date sales were up 7.1% over the 
same period in  1999. Industrial sector sales continued to grow strongly, 
posting an  11.1% increase. Consumption by the residential sector increased 
1%,  while the commercial sector decreased 1.1%.
