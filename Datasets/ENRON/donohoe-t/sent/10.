I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net 
advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 
4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does 
not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it 
appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to.  
This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If 
for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of 
my warrenty.

On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is 
a hill workout, time or what ever?

What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?

Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 
intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for 
an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?
