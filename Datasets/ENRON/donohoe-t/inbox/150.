Attendee:	Steven Shia, President
Background:	This is an existing customer, however, we are looking to expand the relationship while they are here.  We want them to buy into our financial risk management services.  Our goal, while he is in town, is to a.) Resolve existing credit issues, b.) Pitch our financial risk management services  as well as lock him into longer term deals and c.) to discuss terms and conditions of existing trade agreement.

**Your Role**  To prove to him that the business model we use is replicable across markets.  Since Pulp&Paper is not as established as other Enron businesses, we want his confidence that Enron can benefit his business.
