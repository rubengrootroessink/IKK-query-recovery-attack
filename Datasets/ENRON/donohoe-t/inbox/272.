I am working out of the Shreveport office this morning till approximately
9:30.  Please call me at 318-429-3832 for any IT rates for tomorrow.  AOL
IM is also up at JAFOGG

For gas flow for Thursday October 18, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10          Ruston Compressor
work cuts back on IT
Tetco Bald Knob                       50
Texas Gas Helena                      50
MRT Glendale                          10
Other Line AC points                        10
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     15
SBS injection space                   50           tomorrow in Dec out
SBS withdrawal space                        50          available for
withdrawal with Oct or longer payback
Backhaul to west                      50

Amber Station is flowing 353 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 121 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

MRT is taking its Unionville Storage field out of service for a couple of
days for maintainance.  During this time, REGT will be working with MRT to
balance service.  This will limit REGT storage space over the next few days
and may also limit IT at particular points.

Arkla is pulling over 300 Mdth with the cooler weather and peaked at over
600 Mdth/hr rate.  I do not have the power report.

Gas Prices     East  $2.375
          West  $2.290

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0386/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I will be back in the Houston office on Thursday.

Thanks
