Tom and Tammy,

	After talking with Dan Masters yesterday, I believe we have the Buy / Sale incorrect in our system.  In Sitarra, the deal (Sale side #672336) was set up for a monthly total of 10,920 (should acutally be 10,902) and was set up for March 16 - 31.  Being that the dates were set as such, a total was calculated for those days only producing a volume of 5,632 to sell back to Enron LNG.  Dan Masters says that the buyback contract was not supposed to be daily and should be for the full monthly amount of 10,902 mmbtu.  He says that they sold us the full contract amount and that they bought back the full 10,902.  Could both of you please look at this and correct the volumes in our system so that I can invoice Enron LNG for the 10,902 mmbtu instead of the 5,632?  Please let me or Dan know if you have any questions.
