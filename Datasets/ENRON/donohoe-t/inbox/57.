We will be upgrading the EnronOnline website tonight to include new functionalitysuch as Floating  the  Todays Transaction Window.

As our special group of select and distinguished users, you guys are going to get it before anyone else does.

This release has been tested and we are not expecting any problems, but if you encounter difficulties with your new website as a result of this upgrade, please call the EnronOnline help desk. Additionally we will have an EnronOnline person circulating on the floor to assist with any difficulties.

You will not have to do anything to receive the upgrade - it will happen automatically at your login tomorrow.
