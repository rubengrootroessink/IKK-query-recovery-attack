For gas flow for Thursday November 8,  REGT has the following IT capacity:

Other Line AC points                        20

SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit is now forecasted to come back sometime on
Friday.  I will let you know of any changes.  REGT has one storage field
(Koch Bistineau) and MRT has another field done for testing.  Storage
injection space remains tight today and will be through the end of the
week.

Amber Station is flowing 330 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 102 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 87 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.60
          West  $2.535

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.03546/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
