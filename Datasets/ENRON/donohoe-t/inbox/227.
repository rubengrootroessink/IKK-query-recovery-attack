Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 150 Mdth/d and are nominated at similar
levels for today.

Gas Prices     East  $3.075
          West  $2.995

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0499/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.  November FT
bids are due by 11:00 am on Monday.  November FT capacity has been posted.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
