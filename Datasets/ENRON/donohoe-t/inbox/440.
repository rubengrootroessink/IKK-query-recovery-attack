Hi Tom,
1. Deal 1025953, we were billed for the total deal volume 1,350, 000MMBtu but we only show receiving 1,347,167MMBtu.(diff of   2833 MMBtu).
2. Deal 778374, we are being billed on the deal volume and not the actual volumes. I could not find the contract in Sitara to verify if we are to be billed on deal volumes and not actuals. How are we to adjust the variances from the deal volumes to the actuals.

Could you please shed some light on these issues or at least guide me to someone who can.

Thanks,

Kay-
On # 2 below, Jared Kaiser had a deal with someone at ENA (it may have been Tom Donahoe) for the piece you are missing (Sept 1-6).  Please check with Tom to see if it didn't get into the system.

Hi Diane, I have some billing discrepancies

September.

1. Invoice EGK32, Deal 778374, the volume should be 1,103,881MMBtu. I have attached the printscreens from Sitara showing the actual volumes.The sheet is named invegk32.

2. Invoice EGK33, Deal 1025953, Sept 7 - Sept 30, the volume should be 1,077,952MMBtu. I have attached the printscreens from Sitara showing the actual volumes.The sheets are named invegk33a thru d.

July.

1. Invoice EGK25, Deal 778374, the price was NX1+0.01 USD/MMBtu. NX1 for July was 3.182 so the actual price should have been 3.192. You have billed us 3.748. 

Please let me know if these changes can be made and if you can send me corrected invoices.  << File: LNG_Diff_SeptInv01.xls >>
