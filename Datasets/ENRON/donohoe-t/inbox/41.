Tammy-

Since I never heard back from you I assume this is agreeable to you as well.  Please respond one way or the other so we can get the books closed.

Thanks,
Dan Masters

That would be fine with me to settle up in January, 2002. Thanks.

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.
Dan

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Here is a spreadsheet showing your ending balance as of 3/31/01.

Tammy-
Following up on the email below, I show that between the two cargoes we
delivered, Enron LNG Marketing will be billing Enron North America for a
total of 5,759,994 MMBtu on our various contracts.  CMS Trunkline delivered
5,776,300 MMBtu of gas through the pipeline, or 16,306 MMBtu excess. This
16,306 MMBtu is to be handled directly between Trunkline and Enron North
America.
Please let me know if you disagree with any of these figures.
Dan

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
between Enron North America and Trunkline.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters
