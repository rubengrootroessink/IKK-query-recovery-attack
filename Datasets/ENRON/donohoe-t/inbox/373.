Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly on Short-Covering=20




    Natural gas for October delivery on the NYMEX ended the day up $0.015 t=
o $1.915 as the market awaits the AGA storage data due out today. The Novem=
ber contract gained $0.025 to $2.30 per MMBtu. The market managed to recove=
r partially from Monday's sell-off in active pre expiration trading. Much o=
f the gain was due to a late session short-covering rally, and short term t=
raders expect a nominally higher open today. The locals are still wanting t=
o push prices lower to a target of $1.80. There is just a negative bias to =
natural gas, as well as all the energies right now. There is just no demand=
, and the long term weather forecasts are not promising. The October contra=
ct expires today and has lost 25% over the past 6 sessions. NYMEX continues=
 to hold abbreviated floor trading sessions this week. The natural gas open=
 outcry sessions runs from 10:30 AM to 1:45 PM EDT, except today when the c=
lose will be extended until 2:45 PM to allow trading after the release of A=
GA storage data about 2:00 PM. Look for and an injection of  70 - 80 Bcf to=
 be reported for last week. A year ago inventories rose 77 Bcf, and on aver=
age over the last 5 years, stocks have gained about 72 Bcf this week. Total=
 inventories of 2.757 Tcf are 432 Bcf, or 19% higher than a year ago, and 2=
48 Bcf above the 5-year average. NOAA expects 25 CDDs for this week, which =
would be 7 below normal and 9 below a year ago, and could mean another larg=
e build in next week's AGA report relative to the year-ago figure, particul=
arly with spreads to winter still encouraging injections. However, storage =
is about 87% full and will soon begin filling up. The latest National Weath=
er Service forecast for early next month calls for below normal weather alo=
ng the East Coast, extending into East Texas, and above normal from eastern=
 California into the upper Plains. Natural gas for next day delivery across=
 the US and Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 per MMBtu yesterday. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dipped $0.05 to a new 22-m=
onth low of $1.94 per MMBtu.=20

FERC ALJ Postpones California Deadline



    A FERC ALJ has postponed until March 8th the deadline for issuing a rep=
ort on whether California is entitled to refunds of $9 billion for wholesal=
e power purchases when prices soared in the past year. The judge abandoned =
his earlier plan to issue a final report in November. The report's recommen=
dations will be considered by FERC commissioners for any further action. La=
st July, the commissioners ordered a 45-day mediation period for California=
 and the power suppliers to negotiate a compromise. But the clock will not =
start ticking for that 45-day period on December 7th, when all evidence has=
 been submitted by the California ISO and the California PX, the judge said=
. He extended the deadline for finishing the case after agreeing to give th=
e California ISO, and the now-defunct California PX more time to analyze ma=
rket prices during the disputed refund period. The extension is needed by t=
he California ISO to use a sophisticated computer model to analyze and calc=
ulate wholesale power prices from October 2000 through January 2001.=20

Devon, Mitchell Deal Questionable




   The recent drop in Devon Energy's share price could place an obstacle in=
 the path of its planned acquisition of Mitchell Energy. Last month, Devon =
agreed to acquire Mitchell for $31 per share in cash and 0.585 of its own s=
hares for each Mitchell share, in a deal then valued at about $3.1 billion.=
 The companies agreed that the deal should be tax-free for Mitchell stockho=
lders. But, to qualify for tax-free status, the cash component cannot excee=
d 60% of the total offer. Yesterday, Devon's stock fell $0.17 to $32.93 per=
 share, down from about $50 just before the Mitchell deal was struck. Mitch=
ell's shares were also down yesterday, dipping $1.88 to $47.07, while Devon=
's offer for Mitchell was worth $50.26 per share, with the cash component n=
ow making up about 62% of the value. Both companies remain committed to the=
 deal, but realize that it could face problems unless Devon's stock price i=
ncreases by the 4th quarter when the deal is expected to close.=20

United Kingdom Offshore Wind Farm Development=20




  The Crown Estate, landowner of the UK territorial seabed, is granting app=
roval for 13 offshore wind farm sites to interested private companies. Bidd=
ing for licenses to build on the sites started in May and has had a large r=
esponse, as most energy companies are trying to produce environmentally fri=
endly power in response to tighter environmental controls worldwide. If all=
 the offshore wind sites are developed as planned, the power generated over=
 the next 4 years would be between 1,000 MW and 1,500 MW. Each offshore sit=
e will be 3 - 5 miles offshore and is required to have at least thirty 2  -=
 3 MW wind turbine generators with 200 to 250-foot tall steel towers.=20

FERC ALJ Recommends Denial of Pacific Northwest  Power Refunds
 =20
    A FERC Administrative Law Judge has recommended that the full commissio=
n deny the $1.9 billion in refunds requested by Pacific Northwest municipal=
 utilities and wholesale electricity buyers for power purchases last spring=
 when prices jumped sharply higher. The ALJ pointed out that the Pacific No=
rthwest market is very different than the California market, because Califo=
rnia state law prohibited utilities from passing higher power costs on to c=
ustomers, while the market worked properly in the Pacific Northwest when su=
pplies were tight. The Northwestern states rely heavily on hydroelectric po=
wer and suffered a draught situation which coincided with a shortage of ele=
ctricity supplies throughout the Western US. The ALJ contends that the Paci=
fic Northwest experienced a sudden and acute drop in available supply, and =
in that situation prices rose dramatically, as should be normal. Of the tot=
al $1.9 billion sought in refunds, California has laid claim to almost $1.5=
 billion. =20

Governor Expected to Order Lawmakers Back=20




    In attempt to prevent the bankruptcy of Southern California Edison, the=
 governor is poised to order lawmakers to return to Sacramento, after they =
adjourned last week without voting on a rescue plan for the utility. The go=
vernor is in the process of developing a proposal and is consulting with st=
ate senators and Assembly members to find an acceptable compromise between =
the two legislative houses. The new plan will probably allow SCE to sell be=
tween $2.5 and $2.9 billion in bonds which would be secured by existing cha=
rges to about 20% of its biggest commercial consumers. California's Senate =
has approved a version of the bill, voting for $2.5 billion in bond sales, =
but secured by the rates of 4,000 of SCE's largest customers. In addition, =
the state would have the option to purchase the utility's transmission line=
s at book value. SCE argues that the plan would not prevent its bankruptcy.=
 The Assembly version increased the bond sale to $2.9 billion and spread th=
e costs over 136,000 business customers. In addition, the lawmakers gave th=
e state the option to buy the transmission grid at double the book value or=
 at market value, whichever is less, and a provision to reinstate the retai=
l power market. However, when the Senate received the amended bill, it decl=
ined to vote on the measure, adjourning for the year instead. The governor =
is expected to limit the topics under discussion by the legislature when th=
ey return, in order to prevent lawmakers from discussing bills unrelated to=
 the rescue plan.
