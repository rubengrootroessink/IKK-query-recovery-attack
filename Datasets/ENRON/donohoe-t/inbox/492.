Subject: SBS/PALS Cycling Capacity


REGT is posting today its ability to offer discounted SBS/PALS rates for
deals starting in April 2002 for one year terms or longer.

REGT estimates that there could be as much as 2.0 Bcf available for SBS
cycling deals on a year-around basis starting in April 2002.
The daily deliverability associated with this volume will vary by deal but
is roughly based on:

               injection 3500 dth per every 100,000 dth capacity
               withdrawal     4000 dth per every 100,000 dth capacity

SBS/PALS is an interruptible service and REGT cannot guarantee its
availability everyday.  REGT is offering to enter into rates pertaining to
this capacity for a long term period should it become available.

REGT would be interested in entertaining a variety of deal structures or
proposals, including the traditional reservation/commodity setup.  Rates
may be posted as negotiated rate structures.

Written  requests  for possible discounted rates should be received by REGT
by  the  end of the business day on December 7, 2001.  You can email or fax
them into me at 713-207-9628 or jfogg@reliantenergy.com.

Please  contact  me  at  713-207-5183  concerning  additional  questions or
inquiries.

Thanks

JAF
