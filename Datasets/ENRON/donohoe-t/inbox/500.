east and Line 2 South is at 106 Mdth for today.  Be aware that REGT is not
offering any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of
Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless
of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.

Power plants burned 111 Mdth on Monday and noms are down to 75 Mdth.
Arkla loads are about 10% above normal (400 Mdth/d) for Wednesday but are
forecasted to drop back to about 1/3 warmer than normal for the weekend.

Gas Prices     East  $2.475
          West  $2.370

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0338/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
