Natural Gas Futures Continue Downward Spiral




    Natural gas for November delivery on the NYMEX continued decline yester=
day, dropping $0.036 to $2.208 after hitting a new contract low of $2.14. T=
he December contract dipped $0.02 to $2.602 per MMBtu. Prices opened sharpl=
y lower, but managed to stage an erratic rally to finish near the highs of =
the day. The mild weather and diminishing storage availability continue to =
pressure a weak cash market which in turns is dragging down futures prices.=
 As storage becomes less available more expensive, the differential between=
 cash and futures could continue to widen. Early injection estimates for to=
morrows weekly AGA storage report range between 75 Bcf to 85 Bcf. For the s=
ame week last year, stocks rose 78 Bcf, and on average over the last 5 year=
s, stocks have gained about 70 Bcf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad=
ministration reports last week's tally of 39 Heating Degree Days was 11 abo=
ve normal, but 5 less than forecast and 5 below the same week a year ago. N=
OAA said it expected 44 HDDs this week, or 6 above normal. In terms of cool=
ing degree days, NOAA said last week's tally of 18 was 13 less than the pre=
vious week, 7 below normal and 2 less than the same week a year ago. NOAA h=
as forecast 13 CDDs this week, which is 6 below normal. The latest NWS fore=
cast calls for normal temperatures for most of the nation, except for parts=
 of the Midwest, Northeast and South Texas which will be below normal. Manu=
facturing activity, which consumes about 45% of all natural gas use, contra=
cted for a 14th straight month in September but showed signs of improvement=
. The National Association of Purchasing Management monthly index dipped on=
ly slightly in September, slipping to 47.0 in its worst slump since the 199=
0-1991 recession. A reading under 50 indicates that manufacturing activity,=
 about one-sixth of the overall economy, is declining. The NAPM index has n=
ow held below that level since August 2000, but has been steadily improving=
 from January's 10-year low of 41.2. Natural gas for next day delivery acro=
ss the US and Canada was generally off $0.05 $0.10 yesterday. Natural gas f=
or next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.05 to $1.77 per MMBtu.

Restart of Dabhol Power Project Proposed



    A panel established by the Indian state of Maharashtra has suggested th=
at if all parties involved are willing to absorb the costs, the 2,184 MW Da=
bhol power project could be re-started. The panel suggested that if all the=
 shareholders were willing to absorb the costs, the tariff on Dabhol's powe=
r could be reduced. The panel has also proposed that Enron, GE and Bechtel =
absorb a huge loss on their investment in the project. After a acrimonious =
dispute with the local utility, Enron had said it would like to abandon the=
 project. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which had initially cont=
racted to purchase all the power from Dabhol plant, subsequently defaulted =
on payments because it didn't need that much power and claimed it was too e=
xpensive. Enron claimed the utility was in violation of its contractual obl=
igations. Dabhol took the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration=
 in London, but Enron has said it would settle out of court if it could rec=
over its costs.=20

Congress to Hold Hearing on Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline




    Congress plans to consider a multi-billion dollar pipeline project to t=
ransport natural gas from Alaska today. A consortium of oil companies last =
week released a gloomy report on the project's economics. BP, Phillips Petr=
oleum and Exxon Mobil unveiled a preliminary study on the project last week=
 that showed smaller investment returns than previously estimated. The proj=
ect is uneconomical at this point, but despite the study the project has no=
t been shelved. The consortium will likely make a decision on the project b=
y the and of the year. Depending on the route, it may cost between $15 bill=
ion and $17 billion. The 2000-mile southern route parallels the TAPS to Fai=
rbanks, then turns to follow the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Territory=
 and British Columbia, connecting with existing pipelines in Alberta. The 1=
,650-mile northern route runs east from the North Slope to the Mackenzie Ri=
ver delta, then south along the Mackenzie valley into Alberta. It would be =
cheaper, but would have to cross the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The S=
enate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a hearing today o=
n legislation that may be needed to move pipeline construction forward. The=
 hearing will  focus on ways the federal government can help improve projec=
t economics. The consortium has requested fast-track approval of FERC permi=
ts, but no direct federal subsidies for construction costs. The Bush admini=
stration says the project must be independently feasible and not rely on su=
bsidies. Natural gas from Alaska could make up 10% of nations energy suppli=
es by 2015, according to a study from the Interstate Natural Gas Supply Ass=
ociation of America.=20

California Has a Plan in Case Bond Sale Delayed




    Californias controller says that the state is on solid economic ground =
and is not facing a fiscal emergency, even if a proposed bond sale is postp=
oned. The state is attempting to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the =
general fund for $6.1 billion spent on buying power for Pacific Gas & Elect=
ric and Southern California Edison. The bond sale is being held up because =
state regulators have not approved the designation of a portion of the util=
ities rates to repay the bonds. Last month, the state sold $5.7 billion in =
revenue anticipation notes to boost the general fund and provide a buffer u=
ntil the bonds can be sold. Since revenue anticipation notes must be repaid=
 by the end of the fiscal year, California could issue revenue anticipation=
 warrants to repay the notes if the bonds are not issued before. The state =
treasurer has warned that the states budget deficit could rise to $9.3 bill=
ion by the beginning of fiscal year 2003 if the bonds are not issued by the=
n and state lawmakers would have to consider raising taxes or cutting spend=
ing. =20
