Tom:
I talked with Mary this a.m. and I don't understand why she is making this out to be so difficult but she didn't understand what we need re: Panaco.  I told her that Milton Bolanos ( Volume Mgmt) has the downloaded pipeline statements which show the daily cashout over the past year for each block on Hios and Larry Aguirre Has ANR.  All she has to do is apply the cashout price for each month and spit out the totals and add them together to see the net effect over the year and do the same for yr. 2001.   I asked her to get back to me with an ETA.   The Devon 2000 $$  are still not put into your book, this is the email that she forwarded to me.  I asked her to update you directly.  This is the message from her.

I have a meeting with Philip Love and Kam Kaiser Wed. 6/6/01 at 9:am
	1. How do they want to book in Sitara.
	2. Calculations of Panaco (Jan-March 01) complete. Using your "Hios Imbalance" graph Jan-Mar 01 had the biggest 	swing. I need to meet with the principles to discuss.
	4. It will be the end of the week before Devon 2001 penalties are complete. I'll be doing system testing this afternoon.

I hate to be a pest but, Tom really needs to get some answers re:

1.  Status of the Devon $$ for year 2000 that I think you were working with Philip Love in Risk Mgmt.  Did it get moved into ENA Central Gulf?
2.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2000.
3.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2001.
4.  The Devon penalties and cashout for 2001.
