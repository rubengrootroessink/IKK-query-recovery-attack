Tom,
I was talking to Tony Honings with Central Illinois Light this morning about doing some trades on EOL.  He said he calls you to do some of his physical deals and said he just likes talking to the traders.  He did say he needed to start doing some online trades.  He's close so next time you talk to him, see if you can give him a shove.
Thanks.
Bill
