Dear Tom,

Thank you for writing to Amazon.com.

I have sent a reply to your message to the e-mail address associated with
your account.  To protect your privacy, we can only send account
information to the e-mail address on file for your account.  We appreciate
your patience with our security measures.

I hope that this does not cause you any inconvenience.  Please note that
you may check the status of your account and orders at any time by
clicking on the "Your Account" link at the top of our web site.

If you have a time-sensitive concern, you can always contact us by
telephone.  Our Customer Service department is open 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week:

If you no longer use the e-mail address you used when you first shopped at
Amazon.com, I would strongly recommend changing the e-mail address on file
for your account.

As a security precaution, we ask that customers change their e-mail
addresses directly on our web site.  This ensures that the person
requesting the change knows the password for the existing customer

2. Under "Your Account Settings," click on "Change your name, e-mail
   address or password."

3. Enter your *old* e-mail address and password to sign in.

4. On the next page, enter your *new* e-mail address in the space provided
   and click "Submit changes."  You can also use the "Your Account" link
   to view and modify your orders at any time.
