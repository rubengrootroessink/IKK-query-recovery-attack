** Forwards and Swaps from the Flight Deck **
                Available May 14, 2001
You are the new Risk Manager for Lucky Seven Airlines,
and today's your first day. Join your new boss, pilot and
owner Bud Russo, and learn how Forwards and Swaps are
the financial instruments that can help keep Lucky Seven
in the air. On your first day on the job, you'll get an in-depth
look at how they work and some practical applications.

** Introduction to the Oil Industry **
               Available Now
The oil business is a huge global industry, encompassing
many specific activities. An Introduction to the Oil
Industry provides a sweeping overview of this fascinating
sector of the energy industry. You'll see it all, from
underground to the gasoline pump. Join oilman RJ Dewing for
the complete tour.

** Hedging With Futures and Options **
                 Coming in June
This course will provide an overview of hedging using exchange-
traded futures and options. It will cover key terms and concepts
and will review hedging strategies using futures and options for a
range of different participants. The course will contain practical
examples from various commodity markets.

** Understanding Value-at-Risk **
                Coming in July
Value-at-risk can be an important tool for measuring risk, but
it is often misunderstood.  Because of the complexity of
value-at-risk calculations, it's easy to become bewildered.
Professor Viktor O VerWrisck, the eminent statistician, is
ready to tackle this complicated subject and explain it in
simple terms so that you no longer need to suffer from
VAR anxiety.
