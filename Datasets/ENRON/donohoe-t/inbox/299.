Amber Station is flowing 377 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 115 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discount from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  Compressor
maintenance along REGT's mainlines also continues at this time.

Power plants burned at 163 Mdth/d yesterday and are nominated at lower
levels for today.     Arkla has been taking about 190 Mdth/d but this may
increase slightly for tomorrow with the cold fronts moving through the
region.

Gas Prices     East  $2.075
          West  $1.98

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0338/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
