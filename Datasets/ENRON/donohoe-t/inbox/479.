For gas flow for the Weekend Saturday November 10 through Monday November
12,  REGT has the following IT capacity:

Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10

Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0          testing two fields today
and tomorrow
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The factory is taking longer than hoped for on fixing the suction bottles
and the latest estimate of the return of the Delhi compressor is next
Friday.  Volumes are being held at 250,000 dth at CGT at this time.  Also,
REGT has the #1 unit at Malvern down for repair.  Storage injection space
remains tight due to two tests being run on REGT today and tomorrow.  The
Bistineau storage field is shut in for bottom hole testing and Chiles Dome
undergoes its annual 4 point withdrawal test tomorrow.

Amber Station is flowing 353 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 111 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning less than 200
Mdth/d but is forecasted to increase slightly for Saturday as a weak cold
front moves across the area but quickly return to warmer than normal levels
on Sunday and into next week.

Gas Prices     East  $2.595
          West  $2.535

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0354/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
