Tom or Phillip,

Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.  I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.  Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
