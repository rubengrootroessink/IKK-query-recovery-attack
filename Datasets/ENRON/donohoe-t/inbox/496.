REGT had an upset on its system yesterday.  The following alert has been 
posted:

The #2 unit at Chandler Station near Wilburton, Oklahoma has gone down for 
unscheduled repairs.  Estimated duration of downtime is ten to
twelve days.  Day trading IT capacity will be limited in the Quadrangle, Line 
AC, and Perryville Hub. Further IT and secondary firm
reductions in these same areas may be required at some point in time. REGT 
will provide as much advance notification as possible of further
reductions should it become necessary.

With a big unit at Malvern Compressor Station also down at this time, IT 
space is limited for tomorrow.

Power plants are still in the 100-125 range.  Arkla takes are expected up on 
Wednesday due to a fast cold front moving through the area but it will not 
have a major lasting impact beyond a day or two.

I am out of the office today and am sending this from home.  Marie Downing 
will be covering for any rate quotes.  You can reach Marie at 713-207-5194.  
I will be back in the office tomorrow.

Thanks 

JAF
