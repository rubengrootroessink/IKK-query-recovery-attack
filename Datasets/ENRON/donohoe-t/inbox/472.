REGT has the #1 unit at Malvern down for repair, the Delhi Compressor unit
looks to be out until late Friday and the Bistineau storage field is shut
in for bottom hole testing through Friday.   Storage injection space
remains tight today and will be through the end of the week.

Amber Station is flowing 338 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 98 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.    Arkla is forecasted to increase
slightly for Friday as a weak cold front moves across the area but quickly
return to warmer than normal levels through the weekend.

Gas Prices     East  $2.605
          West  $2.545

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0355/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
