The Delhi Compressor unit in NE Louisiana in the Perryville Hub complex
cracked a discharge bottle last Friday.  This limits our ability to
compress into CGT and REGT will be limited on deliveries into CGT.  For
Wednesday, CGT deliveries will be cut to the 250 Mdth/d level.  The cuts
will be pro-rata based on nominations.  The bottle will take at least 1 to
2 weeks to repair.   It looks like it will be into next week before the
compressor is fully operational.

Amber Station is flowing 361 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 109 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 148 Mdth/d level.  Arkla pulled over 345
Mdth/d and peaked at 680 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  n/a
          West  n/a

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on $3.05
= $0.0495/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
