Subject: REGT Capacity Report Monday Nov 26


Welcome back.   Hope everyone had a good and safe Thanksgiving.  For gas
flow for Tuesday,November 27, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0          CGT back on line at 326
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       15           TETCO pressures have
been up and down, limiting IT.
Texas Gas Helena                      85
MRT Glendale                          15
Other Line AC points                        15
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                   75
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      50

REGT is still having problems with several compressors including Malvern
#1, Ada, Round Mountain and Chandler stations.   Amber Station is flowing
295 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 99 Mdth for today.  Be aware that REGT
is not offering any general interruptible transportation discounts from
West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate,
unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD
and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.

Power plants only burned about 30 to 35 Mdth/d over the past few days.  I
have not seen any Arkla report for the weekend but the weather was mild.
Look for a pickup  with the colder weather hitting the system through
Wednesday but it may be just a quick hitting front

Gas Prices     East  $1.70
          West  $1.615

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0237/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
