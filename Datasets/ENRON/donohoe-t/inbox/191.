Tom:  This is the response I got for my request with settlements.....I will let you know what the word is on Monday.  Also, I have requested that she tell me when she can have numbers for this year Devon penalties/Cashout too.  Unfortunately, they act as though we are asking a lot.  They have the data in Excel and it is just a matter of sorting by counterparty and looking at the cashout total by month, then adding them together to see the net effect. I'll let you know asap.
Mark

Yes this is a lot of work. The original discussion, I thought,  was to so a sample month or two to see if there was  a trend.
I will work this weekend and see who far I get. I'll let you know Monday morning.

I was talking to Tom Donohoe, the Central Gulf trader, today and he said he needs to know the net effect of cashout for all of the past months together in order to determine if we should make waves and force Panaco to pay for Cash Out.  I realize this is a lot of work but, we are running out of time and I just need to get word back to him as to how long it will take.  I don't think it would be a good idea to pick the months that are beneficial to Enron since Panaco will  do the same to us.  Please let me or Lisa Kinsey know what can be done.
Thanks,
Mark
