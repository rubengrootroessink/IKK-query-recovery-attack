Amber Station is flowing 368 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 133 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

MRT is taking its Unionville Storage field out of service for a couple of
days for maintainance.  During this time, REGT will be working with MRT to
balance service.  This will limit REGT storage space over the next few
days.

Power plants burned at 125 Mdth/d yesterday and are nominated similar for
today.

Gas Prices     East  $2.125
          West  $2.020

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0346/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.  I will be traveling to the REGT
Shreveport office this afternoon and will be working out of Shreveport for
tomorrow.  I will let you know the telephone up in Shreveport in tomorrow's
email.

Thanks
