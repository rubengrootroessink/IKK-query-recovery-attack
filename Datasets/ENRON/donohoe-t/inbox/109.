I have nominated 16,646mm at 368 on the 10th and taken it to 1mm per Charlene on the 11th. As of the 12th, I took it to "0".   Our trader, Tom Donohoe,  has told me that since you have a force majure there as of the 12th. we can not take the well to 1 and it will be at "0" till you are flowing gas to us again.  If you have gas that flows onto the system we will discuss buying it from you later in the month.   Please have your  marketer  call Tom Donohoe if you need to discuss this at 713-853-7151.

Mark-  HIOS just called and asked that Enron nom a 1 for HI 351/368 beginning May 10 instead of 0.  The reason for this is that their system needs this to allocate correctly.  Please advise if you have any questions at 405-228-4298.  Thanks!
