Hello

Thanks for the quick response, if you wish to pay via visa I personally 
can't process your card you would need to either open an account with 
www.paypal.com or www.bidpay.com  -both of them take about a minute to set 
up, but please note paypal is a free service while bidpay charges (but is 
easier to use).

All prices are in US dollars. Please e-mail me your shipping address for 
faster order processing, and include your e-mail address or auction info 
with your payment to avoid processing delays.

Item of purchase : NANCY DREW COMPLETE 54 HARDCOVER BOOK SET NEW
Price : $165.00
Surface shipping (5-10 days) : $30.00  - For faster shipping options see below
Total : $195.00

- For Insurance ADD $2.00 - (if nothing arrives I will send another one no 
hassles)
- For airmail shipping ADD $10.00  - (4-5 days delivery time on average)
- For express shipping ADD $20.00  - (2-4 days guaranteed with tracking and 
is insured)

Payment options:

(1) Pay by credit card: through www.paypal.com (see end of e-mail for more 
info) or  www.bidpay.com and the item will be shipped out as soon as 
possible - note: paypal is a free service while bidpay is not
(2) Pay by money order: Upon receipt of the money order I will ship the 
item out asap.

Please send you payments and make payable to:

Ms. Liz Olsen
22773 Reid Avenue

V2X 4G7
Canada
*PLEASE remember it costs 60 cents (not 34) cents to send a letter to Canada


Paying with Paypal:

If you do not have a paypal account you will need to open one here is the 
link: https://secure.paypal.com/refer/pal=onservice@telus.net

Just click on the "sign up" button on the top right corner. Please enter 
your information about your self. Paypal is the most popular online payment 
service available, and most auction sellers accept it. I also recommend 
paypal because you can pay via credit card or bank account (takes a while 
with a bank account) and they do not process your credit card on-line as 
most web sites do, thus your information is not stored on the internet and 
not readily available to hackers.

If you have a paypal account or have just finished signing up go to 
www.paypal.com and sign in. Then click "send money" at the top of the main 
page. On the next screen you need to enter info about the auction, my 
e-mail address is onservice@telus.net and my last name is Olsen. If you 
wish the item to be shipped somewhere besides your billing address please 
make that clear under the section where you can leave a note.

It takes about 30 seconds to send money via paypal, and when you have 
finished sending it paypal will send me an e-mail, upon receipt of 
confirmation of payment being received I will ship the item asap.
