FERC Wants to Increase Industry Monitoring





    The new chairman of the FERC wants to increase the Commission's ability=
 to monitor energy sales in order to prevent abuses rather than just react =
to complaints. The commission has asked Congress to approve over $1.3 milli=
on for the addition of 10 senior level officials to monitor energy sales an=
d actively look for market abuses. The agency currently has 50 people assig=
ned to enforcement. The chairman says that even though the market has been =
moving towards deregulation for 10 years, the commission has not adjusted i=
ts examinations. The FERC is asking Congress to give it more authority to i=
mpose fines of up to $10,000 per violation, per day. Violators could lose t=
he ability to base rates on market prices and be forced to charge only appr=
oved rates. The Electric Power Supply Association says members aren't afrai=
d of additional market monitoring so long as it doesn't cross the line into=
 political interventions every time there is a market fluctuation. High pri=
ces don't necessarily mean markets aren't working and can provide signals t=
he market needs more power supply or a demand response.=20

Midwest Utilities Combine into Transmission Entity



     Six Midwest power companies have applied with the FERC to form a new e=
ntity to merge their electric transmission systems. The new transmission co=
mpany will be called Translink Transmission. It will be a for-profit compan=
y set up as part of FERC's 1999 order that investor-owned utilities join a =
RTO by the end of this year. The FERC has made RTOs a top priority since th=
e California power crisis.  RTOs establish common rules that allow utilitie=
s to smoothly trade bulk power across the borders of their own local transm=
ission systems. Applicants for Translink Transmission consist of IES Utilit=
ies and Iowa and Interstate Power; Iowa's Corn Belt Power Cooperative; MidA=
merican Energy; Nebraska Public Power District; Omaha Public Power District=
; and Xcel Energy. The utilities will participate in Translink through a co=
mbination of divestiture, leases and operating agreements.  Translink will =
manage 26,000 miles of transmission lines and about 35,500 MW to about 6.9 =
million utility customers in 14 states. It expects to be in business by the=
 end of next year. The new transmission company will also contract with the=
 Midwest ISO for RTO services.  Separately, a Canada's Manitoba Hydro has j=
oined Midwest ISO. The agreement is the first international extension of a =
US based ISO. Manitoba Hydro has 5,200 MW of mostly hydroelectric power gen=
eration and provides energy to all of Manitoba except central Winnipeg. The=
 coordination agreement allows the utility to participate in the ISO withou=
t violating Canadian law, which prevents Manitoba Hydro from signing the Mi=
dwest ISO's transmission owners' agreement. Manitoba and the Midwest ISO ar=
e both part of Mid-Continent Area Power Pool.=20

California Generators Want Payment Plan=20



    Five large power generators have contacted Southern California Edison i=
n an attempt to find out how much, when and if they will be paid for electr=
icity sold to the utility. Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron and Puget Sound E=
nergy say they have received little assurance that the SCE intends to work =
out a payment plan with its creditors if the California legislature fails t=
o pass a rescue plan. State senators adjourned last month without approving=
 a $2.9 billion rescue package. The governor has called special session lat=
er this month to consider a bail-out, however it is unlikely the lawmakers =
will pass the measure in its present form. The current version of the plan =
does not allow SCE to use bonds sold under the measure to pay the generator=
s. Since SCE supported that version of the plan, the generators want to kno=
w how they will be paid. An attorney for the companies says they want a sim=
ple yes or no to whether or not SCE is interested in negotiating a forbeara=
nce agreement. The generators contend that SCE can take steps to ensure tha=
t all creditor classes are treated equally, and payments can be made from e=
xisting funds or from a sale of secured bonds.=20
