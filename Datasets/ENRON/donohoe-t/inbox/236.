Amber Station is flowing 330 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 129 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

Power plants burned at 155 Mdth/d and are nominated at similar levels for
today.

Gas Prices     East  $2.61
          West  $2.55

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0424/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.  I will be
sending out an email on November FT capacity to you later today

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.
