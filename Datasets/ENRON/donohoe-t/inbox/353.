Natural Gas Futures End Flat=20




Natural gas futures for November delivery on the NYMEX went nowhere yesterd=
ay, failing to break above $2.30 per MMBtu and settling at $2.253 per MMBtu=
, unchanged from Wednesday. Trading was thin as many traders were out of th=
e ring for a religous holiday. On the positive side, the first month of the=
 winter strip's support held at $2.21 per MMBtu and did not gravitate towar=
d the October futures expiration or physical prices, as volatility has abso=
lutely fled the market. The December contract lost $0.009 to $2.624 per MMB=
tu, trading within a narrow $0.075 range. So attention remains fixed on the=
 $0.42 differential between the October expiration and the November contrac=
t. With $2.21 setting up to be a pivotal support level, a breakdown below $=
2.20 could be deemed a failure. If the market sees no strength today ahead =
of a low-demand weekend, expect another sell-off ahead of what happened las=
t Monday when the October contract sold down $0.20 to 30-month lows. Extrem=
ely bearish fundamentals remain in place, from weather, to storage, to lack=
 of industrial load and hurricanes. So look for the November contract to tr=
ade downward in the next few days in an effort to resolve that high spread.=
 However, trading for today into the weekend remains a tough call as the ma=
rket has not shown a willingness to go anywhere lately. Next week, the NYME=
X extends energy trading from 10 AM to 2 PM EDT, except for Wednesday, whic=
h will trade 10 AM to 2:30 PM to accommodate trading after the AGA storage =
report. The latest NWS forecast for next week calls for below normal weathe=
r for the Eastern half of the US, from Texas into the Northeast, and above =
normal in most of the West. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US=
 was generally flat to $0.05 lower yesterday. Canadian spot prices were up =
$0.05 $0.10 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub d=
ipped $0.01 to $1.89 per MMBtu.=20

Reliant Acquires Orion=20




Reliant Resources will buy Orion Power Holdings for about $2.9 billion in c=

W to 25,100 MW, either currently in operation or under construction. Orion =
operates primarily in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The move will provid=
e Reliant with some strategically placed assets in the transmission-challen=
ged New York City market. Reliant will pay $26.80 per share for Orion, whic=
h is about a 40% premium based on its current NYSE price of $19.20 and woul=
d assume $1.8 billion of Orion's debt. The purchase will be paid for by cas=
h on hand, $400 million of current credit and a new bridge loan of $1.6 - $=
1.8 billion. The acquisition would give Reliant a $7.7 billion market capit=
alization. With deregulation and growing demand for power, it is estimated =
that at least 180,000 MW of generation capacity will be needed in the US by=
 2002. The onset of the retail power market resulted in 16% of the nation's=
 generation capacity changing hands, and the other 84% may change ownership=
 over the next 10 years.

Former Trinity CEO Pleads Guilty




Sidney Sers, Trinity Gas former chief executive, has pled guilty to money l=
aundering and obstruction of justice charges and could face life in prison =
and a $15 million fine. Sers admits to transferring $800,000 made in violat=
ion of 1997 and 1998 court orders. The charges stem from a SEC probe of Ser=
s and Trinity. Both were charged with bilking investors out of millions of =
dollars by issuing a number of false and misleading statements intended to =
boost the company's shares, allowing officers to sell stock at inflated pri=
ces. A sentencing date has not yet been set. Sers transferred Trinity share=

Exelon Lowers 3rd Quarter Earnings Forecast=20




Exelon said 3rd quarter profit will be about 25% below forecasts due to low=
er demand for electricity. With the downturn in the nations economy, electr=
icity usage by manufacturers has dropped, and with milder temperatures than=
 expected, air conditioning use slumped during the summer. Exelon was forme=
d when Peco Energy merged with Unicom. The company's ComEd and Peco Energy =
utilities have about 5 million electricity customers in northern Illinois a=
nd southeastern Pennsylvania. Peco also sells natural gas to 425,000 custom=
ers in the Philadelphia area. Since Exelon has few plants that burn natural=
 gas, it has not been able to take advantage of falling prices. Exelon expe=
cts to earn $1.10 to $1.20 per share, lowered from predictions of $1.35 to =
$1.80 per share. Analysts had forecast a profit of $1.57. Exelon stock fell=
 $5.95 to $44.50, dropping about $1.9 billion from its market value. Its sh=
ares have dropped 37% this year.=20

Williston Basin Plans New Pipeline



Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline plans to file for FERC approval to buil=
d 245 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline across parts Wyoming, Montana a=
nd North Dakota. The pipeline, expected to begin north of Gillette, Wyoming=
 and end south of Killdeer, North Dakota, initially would be capable of tra=
nsporting from 80 - 120 MMcf per day. Additional transportation capacity co=
uld be added incrementally as natural gas production grows. Initially, the =
pipeline is expected to have 3 large compressor stations - one on the south=
 end of the route in Wyoming, another in eastern Montana and the third in N=
orth Dakota. Additional transportation capacity through the pipeline can be=
 made available by adding more compression facilities. The pipeline would t=
ransport volumes from developing coal-bed and conventional natural gas prod=
uction in central Wyoming and south central Montana to interconnecting pipe=
lines that will transport it to large Midwestern markets. The selection of =
the pipeline's route is nearly complete and initial surveying work has begu=
n. After FERC approval, construction could begin in third quarter of 2002, =
with transportation service slated to begin in late 2002.=20

Gulf of Mexico Natural Gas Volumes Declining



The Gulf of Mexico will remain an important source for natural gas, but is =
unlikely to meet projected soaring demand in the next few years. Since the =
mid-1980s the focus has shifted increasingly to deeper waters which yield m=
ore oil than natural gas. While the shallow water of the continental shelf =
contain twice as much natural gas as oil, that is reversed in water depths =
of 1,000 feet or more. The National Petroleum Council forecasts annual dema=
nd will rise to 29 Tcf by 2010 from about 23 Tcf now. According to the MMS,=
 natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has fallen steadily from a pe=
ak of 5.14 Tcf in 1997 to 4.9 Tcf in 2000. During that period ,deepwater na=
tural gas production actually rose to 980 Bcf from 380 Bcf, but not enough =
to offset the larger drop in shallow water production. The MMS forecasts a =
wide range of possibilities for the future, with total Gulf of Mexico outpu=
t possibly falling up to 16% by 2005 or rising as high as 24%. In an effort=
 to increase production, the MMS has introduced royalty relief for companie=
