For gas flow for Thursday, November 1,  REGT has the following IT capacity:
Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Thursday, same as before
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       30
Texas Gas Helena                      75
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                   10           warmer weather expected
on system, limits injections
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit in NE Louisiana in the Perryville Hub complex
cracked a discharge bottle last Friday.  This limits our ability to
compress into CGT and REGT will be limited on deliveries into CGT.  For
Wednesday, CGT deliveries will be cut to the 250 Mdth/d level.  The cuts
will be pro-rata based on nominations.  The bottle will take at least 1 to
2 weeks to repair.   It looks like it will be into next week before the
compressor is fully operational.

Amber Station is flowing 345 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 109 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  Arkla pulled over 380 Mdth/d and peaked
at 650 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.995
          West  $2.925

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.0406/dth, almost a penny
drop in fuel costs.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.  I will be out of the office for
the next two days at the SGA Gas Transportation Roundtable in San Antonio,
Texas.  There will not be a morning capacity email for the next two days.
If you need information or a rate quote, you can call Marie Downing at
713-207-5194.  I will be somewhat available to Marie and will be checking
in with her from time to time.

Thanks

JAF
