For gas flow for Wednesday  November 7,  REGT has the following IT
capacity:    Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Wed
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       30
Texas Gas Helena                      90
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit is now forecasted to come back sometime on
Friday.  I will let you know of any changes.  REGT has one storage field
(Koch Bistineau) and MRT has another field done for testing.  Storage
injection space remains tight today and will be through the end of the
week.

Amber Station is flowing 335 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 104 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 75 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.705
          West  $2.63

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.03677/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
