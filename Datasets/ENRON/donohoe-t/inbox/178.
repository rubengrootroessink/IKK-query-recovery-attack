Here is what Trunkline sent us as what was over scheduled (it's from Lotus Notes so I had to copy and paste):


"Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance."

Thanks,
Dan
