Mary:

I hate to be a pest but, Tom really needs to get some answers re:

1.  Status of the Devon $$ for year 2000 that I think you were working with Philip Love in Risk Mgmt.  Did it get moved into ENA Central Gulf?
2.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2000.
3.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2001.
4.  The Devon penalties and cashout for 2001.
