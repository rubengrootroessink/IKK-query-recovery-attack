Tom,

I am the executive recruiter you spoke to today about your trading
background.  Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my
contact information for your records and a couple of resume examples to help
in constructing yours.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies in North America
enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.

Please send your resume back to me so we can talk further about your
background and interests in new opportunities.
