However, West 1 receipt capacity is limited to 7,000 dth.  South receipts
are not available on a FT basis but are available on a secondary basis.

You can email them to me at jfogg@reliantenergy.com or use AOL IM jafogg.

In addition to the FT space, REGT will have capacity for SBS injections in
November, with December withdrawals.  There may be some capacity for
withdrawals next summer but I am still in the process of comfirming that
space.  REGT has up to 1.5 Bcf of November injection space.

call me at 713-207-5183 if you have any questions.

thanks JAF
