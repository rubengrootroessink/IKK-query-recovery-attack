For gas flow for Tuesday, November 6,  REGT has the following IT capacity:
Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Tuesday
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       10
Texas Gas Helena                      90
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit may be back on line in a day or two.

Amber Station is flowing 334 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 98 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 75 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  I have not seen Arkla stats for the
weekend yet.

Gas Prices     East  $2.78
          West  $2.71

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.0374/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

JAF
