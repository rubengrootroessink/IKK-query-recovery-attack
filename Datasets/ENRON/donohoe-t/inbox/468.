Good day all:

I am working to coordinate the weekend.  If you could tell me the time that we can start taking apart PC's and move.  You will need to speak with your managers and find the times that this will be possible.  The earlier the better, but we need to know a time.  You will need to notify everyone of when it will start so they can leave, if a few have to stay we can work around them, but if anyone needs to be here extremely late we will need to know.

Currently we have people starting from 2:30 to 6PM.


Let me know and thank you for all of the help.
