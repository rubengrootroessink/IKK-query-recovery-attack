Good news, Delhi compressor is back on line and seems to be running ok.

Amber Station is flowing 338 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 108 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 150 Mdth/d level yesterday and are nominated
at similar levels for today.  Arkla burned around 200 Mdth, lower than
normal for this weather.  There no major changes are forecasted for this
week.

Gas Prices     East  $1.875
          West  $1.795

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.02456/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
