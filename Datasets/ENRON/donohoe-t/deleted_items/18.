Subject: REGT Capacity Report November 14


For gas flow for Thursday November 15,  REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Thursday
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       20           TETCO pressures have
been up and down, limiting IT.
Texas Gas Helena                      90
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         20
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0          warm weather and high
line pack
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

There has been no update in the estimated date of return for the Delhi
compressor.  The suction bottles are due back from the factory tomorrow and
the Perryville team is planning on having them installed by late Friday,
barring any last minute gliches.   Volumes are still being held at 250,000
dth at CGT at this time.  I will let you know of any updates as soon as I
get them.  Also, REGT has the #1 unit at Malvern down for repair.  Storage
injection space remains tight due to warmer weather and high line pack left
after the tests this past weekend.

Amber Station is flowing 340 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 112 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 149 Mdth/d level yesterday and are nominated
at similar levels for today.  Arkla bumped up to about 321 mdth on Monday
but no major changes are forecasted for this week.

Gas Prices     East  $2.23
          West  $2.14

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0306/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.  However, I will only be around
till 8:45 or so this morning.  If you are looking for IT capacity after
that time, please call Marie Downing at 713-207-5194.

Thanks
