Good news, Delhi compressor is back on line.  The suction bottles were
installed yesterday and the unit tested all night.  REGT is taking CGT back
to its full 326,605 dth capacity.  This will be available for Friday gas
flow and for intraday noms on Thursday.

REGT still has the #1 unit at Malvern up and down for repair.

Amber Station is flowing 348 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 112 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 149 Mdth/d level yesterday and are nominated
at similar levels for today.  Arkla burned around 240 Mdth, normal for this
weather.  REGT is watching this west Texas system for any increases in load
but no major changes are forecasted for this week.

Gas Prices     East  $2.15
          West  $2.08

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0296/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks
