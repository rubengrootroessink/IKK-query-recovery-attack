As you are probably aware, if the voting results in Florida stand as they  
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President. This will have  
Catastrophic results in our vital, no, indispensable entertainment Industry. 
? 
?Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, Whoopie Goldberg, Alec  
Baldwin, Martin Sheen, among many others have sworn to leave the country if  
George W. Bush is elected President. 
? 
?And this is where YOU can help. We need volunteers to help pack and to load  
moving vans. We also need volunteers to provide airfare for these  
irreplaceable national treasures so they can relocate before they can change  
their minds. For the cost of a small SUV you can sponsor one of these  
celebrities and their unfortunate relocation. You will know that your 
efforts  
are helping when you receive postcards, letters and pictures from your 
chosen  
?"refugee" as they learn to become a useful citizen in the third world  
country of their choosing. 
? 
?You will help, won't you. It costs so little, but it means so much. 
? 
Call 1-800-deport-a-lib. Operators are standing by. Major Credit cards are  
Accepted.
