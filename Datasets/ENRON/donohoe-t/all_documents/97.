																					US  Negotiates at Climate Meeting 
																					
																					
																					? ?  At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing  
the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference 
opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere. 
One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against 
their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other 
countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse 
gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some 
developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest  
polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the 
most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse 
gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to 
cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats, 
scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That 
number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the 
arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations. 
Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto, 
governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases 
but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%, 
the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make 
the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is 
among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification 
of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before 
it will  come into force.

																									Allegheny to Buy Power Plants from Enron
																									
																									
																									
																									?  ? ?Allegheny Energy plans to buy three natural gas fired  power plants in 
the Midwest from Enron. Terms have not been  disclosed. The plants, which 
opened in June, are in Wheatland, IN;  Manhattan, IL; and Gleason, TN. They 
can generate a total of 1,710  MW of electricity. Allegheny plans to pay for 
the plants with stock  and debt. The purchase is expected to close in the 
second quarter.
