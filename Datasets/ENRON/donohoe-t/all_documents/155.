																	PG&E Reports Defective Steam Tubes 
																	
																	
																	
																	?  ? PG&E has reported to the NRC that 65 steam generator  tubes in its 
Diablo Canyon 1 nuclear unit in California were  defective but have been 
plugged and pose no safety threat. The  tubes, made from a special metal 
alloy, showed cracks from corrosion  and stress and were no longer in 
service. The tubes are part of the  No. 2 steam generator in Diablo Canyon 1. 
There are four steam  generators in each unit of the two-unit Diablo plant, 
and each  generator has 3,300 tubes. The tubes carry reactor coolant from 
the  reactor to the steam generators. If tubes are cracked, a small  amount 
of radioactive materials could leak into the unit's steam  cycle. The NRC 
limits the number of defective tubes to 15% of the  total in the steam 
generator, but a nuclear unit will begin to lose  power if the total reaches 
10%. Diablo 1 is in cold shutdown, but is  expected to link back up to the 
transmission grid in about a week,  when it will be at about 15% capacity. 
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																																				
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												BP  Buys Alliance Pipeline Capacity
																												
																												
																												? ?  BP Amoco has been acquiring transportation capacity on the Alliance  
pipeline as a prelude to shipping Arctic natural gas through Canada  to the 
US market. BP's Canadian unit was not one of the original  natural gas 
producers to back Alliance, the 1,900-mile?  pipeline set to transport up to 
1.325 Bcf per day to Chicago from  northeastern British Columbia in two 
weeks. But, over the past few  months, it has assumed the transportation 
responsibilities of eight  shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total about 
250 MMcf per day,  and it plans to increase that amount. Construction of one 
or more  pipelines connecting those Arctic pools across Canada's far north 
to  either Alliance or TransCanada PipeLines Alberta system is expected  to 
take at least five years. BP says that gaining capacity on  Alliance will 
eventually play into its Arctic natural gas strategy,  but in the short term 
it is broadening its asset management service.

																															Tnpc  Applies to Sell Power in Texas
																															
																															
																															
																															?  ? Tnpc, formed by Enron, is seeking approval from the Texas PUC  to sell 
power in the state. Tnpc's New Power wants to start  marketing to homes and 
small businesses early next year. Texas  hasn't deregulated yet, but is 
planning a pilot program next year  and will open its entire market to 
competition in January 2002.  Enron formed New Power in May. It has 285,000 
natural gas customers  and 20,000 power customers, mostly in Georgia, Ohio, 
and  Pennsylvania.
