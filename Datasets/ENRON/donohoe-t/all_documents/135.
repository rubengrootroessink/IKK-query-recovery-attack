																									CFTC  Report Shows Speculators Neutral on Energy Futures 
																									
																									
																									
																									?  ? ?Speculators maintained a neutral position on crude and  heating oil 
futures for the week ending last Tuesday, having cut  bets on rising prices 
they made a few weeks ago, according to the  CFTC report. The neutral posture 
helps to explain why the market has  had trouble getting out of the recent 
price range. As a group, the  hedge funds are not looking for a rally or a 
big decline, they're  just watching for fresh indicators. Crude oil prices 
have been  between about $32 and $34 per barrel on the NYMEX since 
mid-October,  after a brief rally to $37. Prices closed Friday at $32.71 per  
barrel. Speculators had bought 39,480 crude oil contracts and sold  40,373 
contracts, giving them a net short position of 893 contracts.  The funds held 
net-long positions for most of the year, with a peak  of 47,171 lots in 
February. Similarly, speculators' heating oil bets  were almost neutral. Net 
long positions were 1,436 lots after  declining every week from a high for 
the year of 25,780 lots on  September 12th. The following table shows the 
changes.
