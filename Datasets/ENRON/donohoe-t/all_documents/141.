Hi Tom,

I need your Help!

 Wisconsin Gas Company invoices us for 236,646 mmbtu for Sept. production on 
ANR pipe.
However, the deals in Unify totalled 209,600 mmbut for ANR pipe, Sept. 
production a difference of 27,035 mmbtu.

It appears that volume purchased at the following points is not reflected in 
unify:
 
 Burlington  3,370
 Centerville             45
 Menominee Falls    605
 Milwaukee              13,725
 New London                2,605
 Southeastern    900
 Steven Point                2,730
 West Bend    855
    _____
    27,035

Please advise of a Sitara deal number.

Thanks
Valerie Curtis

P.S. I faxed copies of p/L support supporting the above 27,035 mmbtu, 
11/03/00.
