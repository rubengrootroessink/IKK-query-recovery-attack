Tom,

I am an analyst with Metals Origination in London and got your name from 
David Oliver.  Enron Metals is in the process of dealing with White Pine 
Copper Refinery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  One of the options we 
are reviewing is returning a dormant generator to operation and selling the 
excess power.  Natural gas is delivered to White Pine through an Enron 
pipeline.  The generator can run on either natural gas or coal.  Several 
years ago ('96 or '97), Enron contacted White Pine (previously owned by BHP 
Copper White Pine Refinery) on numerous occasions about running the 
powerhouse on gas and they would get the excess power to market.  The idea at 
the time was they had excess natural gas and wanted White Pine to run the 
generators on gas.  Would you know anything about this deal or who the 
originator was?  If so, could you or the originator please contact me 
regarding the details.  If not, could you please direct me to someone who may 
know about the original proposal?

Regards,

Bucky Dusek
