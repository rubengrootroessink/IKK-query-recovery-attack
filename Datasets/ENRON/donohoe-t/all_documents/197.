Charlene:
Please forward to Victor also but for next month I'll need the first of the 
month nominations asap in order to confirm all locations / total Index and 
Gas Daily volumes for both HIOS and ANR.  Please let me know as soon as 
possible and also send final revisions directly to me.  I will also need to 
confirm totals verbally after you have send the final nominations for June 1.
Thanks,
Mark
