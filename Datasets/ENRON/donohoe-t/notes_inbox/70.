Mark - I will call you to figure this out. Meanwhile, I think Marilyn

This is to request that Spinnaker's nomination for the VR 375 well(s) be
lowered from the current nom of 11,728 mmbtu to 7443 mmbtu, effective start
of day on 11/21/00.

The reduction is necessary as a result of the SI of the well on Friday,
11/17/00, through the current time, Monday, 11/20/00, combined with shut-ins
that occurred on 11/13 and 11/14.

This nomination volume is based on an assumed rate of 12,700 through the end
of the month.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Marilyn Gullette
337/272-7403
