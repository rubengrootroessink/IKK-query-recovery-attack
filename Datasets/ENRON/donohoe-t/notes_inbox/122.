Mark Schrab -  

???????We received a call today from Petroquest demanding we increase our 
nominations to stay in balance. I have been forwarding you noms daily but PQ 
says you are not changing your nom with ANR.  

??????We (SEC and Cheyenne) are 9,600 mmbtu behind on a month to date basis. 
Please increase our nomination immediately and stay on top of it. As I sent 
you earlier today, current volumes are over 14,000 mmbtu/day which generates 
11,900 mmbtu/day for our share on a current basis. The addition of 9600 over 
20 days adds 480/day for a total nom of 12,380 mmbtu/day (SEC/Cheyenne) 
subject to daily change of production.
