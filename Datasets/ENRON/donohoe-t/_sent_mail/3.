I am in need of several more contract copies.  Could you please forward me 
contract:
 96037261
 96049419
 96001003
 96045391

Also, you had mentioned earlier that GISB contracts should not have been used 
on some of the contracts I earlier received.  Are the appropriate contracts 
going to be sent out,  or are we stuck with the ones in place. 

Call with questions.  3-7151

Sincerely 
Tom Donohoe
