Louis,

A Demand Letter did go out to EOTT yesterday, March 20th.  This letter was sent by fax yesterday afternoon (March 20th) as well as having gone out by UPS last evening (March 20th).

In our Wednesday morning (3/20/02) meeting we discussed sending a demand letter to this CP.  Did that letter go out?  If not, let me know what the hold-up is and I'll do what I can to help move things forward.

Thanks
