Bridgette, 

As discussed, I will provide to you today those recently executed Master Netting Agreements, so they can be placed in "electronic/pdf format". 

However, at present could you advise if the following counterparty (a) Master Netting Agreement, and (b) Amendment(s) were ever placed in electronic form:

	1.	New Power Company (The) 
		a.  Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement 
		b.  First Amendment
		
	2.	PG&E
		a.  Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement
		b.  First Amendment
		c.  Second Amendment
		d.  Third Amendment

	3.	Koch-Entergy Trading, LP
		a.  Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement

	4.	Florida Power & Light Company
