Michael,

I will add these counterparties to the Demand Log -- as they may eventually become a defaulting party down the line.

Thanks for sending me the demand letter log.  Going through it, I found three companies that are on our live list, however, not in your demand letter log.  The three are live and performing so no demand letter is necessary (thought you might want to add them).

Belco Oil & Gas
DTE Energy Trading
Texland Limited Partnerships
