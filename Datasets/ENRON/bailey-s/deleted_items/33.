Susan, can you give me some more specifics on this request.  I can send you a spreadsheet to show you who we net with.   This request is very broad and hopefully we can refine it.  Let me know.

Rhonda,

Thanks for the Southern document.  

Have you any word on the VEPCO document?

Also, please furnish a list and copies of those agreements for Power relating to your arrangements concerning  "payment & close-out netting"

Thanks.

Susan

Here's Southern.  I never received a copy of the Virginia Electric Master Netting.  We do have netting within the EEI.
