Cutiest,

Sorry for my absence -- but we have both been extremely busy lately with all the meetings going on.  However, I just wanted you to know that you are always in my thoughts, even though we may not see each other.

I have wanted to contact you for days, but there was never a free or good moment.  Most of my group is gone this afternoon, so I had a chance to drop a line and check on  how you are fairing.

I have received the news on the Boss and hope you are being taken care of -- since you have been a team for almost 25 years.    Please lets not lose touch -- you & I have shared many good & bad times together and I do not want to lose my only "sister".

Love you,

Sciullo
