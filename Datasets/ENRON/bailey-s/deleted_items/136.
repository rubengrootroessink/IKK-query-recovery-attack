Patrick,

Please furnish a hard copy of each of the swap confirmations for:

		Deal Nos. V48090.1 & V48242.1 

These deals were referenced by the Counterparty.

However, there may be additional confirmations for other financial transactions, therefore, please those confirmations as well (if any).

Thank for all the help.

Cordially,
