The multi-page printout titled "Bankruptcy Book Exposure - COB 2/1/02," which contains exposure broken out by power, gas, and all other products shows exposure as gas-physical only.  

The same is true for:
National Fuel Marketing Company LLC
Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp.
San Diego Gas and Electric Company

Can we remove all of these from our "financial" list?

Eric Boyt: Note that the above listed companies might get shifted to the physical book.

We cannot locate any financial contracts for this counterparty.

Please verify that this party belongs on the ITM Non-terminated financial gas list.
