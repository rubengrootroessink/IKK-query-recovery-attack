The above attached file contains validation of payment from:

Cross Oil's on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
San Diego Gas & Electric on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
Stone Energy Corporation on 3/6/02 for the full demand letter amount
Williams Production RMT on 3/5/02 for an amount considerably larger than the demand letter amount ($0.75M paid vs. $0.64 demand)

Please update the Demand Letter Log to reflect that their payment was received.  No termination letter will go to these CPs at this time.  

Thanks
