Tami,
 
During the last week in January, I delivered to your League in-box the quarterly minutes for the "The Periwinkle Foundation", as well as my OBR questionnaire.

Subject: JLH--OBR Evaluations Due!


Hello Ladies- 

Please fill out and turn in your OBR questionnaire/evaluation located in your OBR notebook as soon as possible.  I need your input in order to recommend or not recommend sending an OBR to agency for next year.  You are my best source of information. 

If you want to fill out the questions and email me, that it FINE. 

If you have trouble finding the eval., please call or email me.  My tel. no. is 281-277-6292. 

Many thanks, Tami Grubb, Comm. Ext. Aff. Coor. JLH
