dona,

your welcome!! when writing my card I could not seem to put better words together -- but you surely are "one cool chick".

i will ask steve about the Phillips and Akers firm, but i believe the Akers is Brock Akers "a former VE lawyer".

hope your week is going well.  i am looking forward to the weekend, as i am scheduled for a facial on saturday.

take care, and lets get together soon -- maybe the weekend of march 9th.

susan
