Susan,

You should have access to those folders and files. I have called the livelink support team to check on your permissions.  
If you don't know where the files are, please send an email to this email address stating what files or folders you are trying to get to.

They will respond to you as soon as they can get to your email.

The email address is Livelink Admin Users@Enron.com or just type in Livelink Admin Users.

Let me know if this helps.  

Thanks, Kien

Kien,

Thanks for the follow-up; however, no Tech has called me nor reported to my desk.
