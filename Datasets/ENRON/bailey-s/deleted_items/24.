Jennifer,

I have reviewed your list of counterparties and have determined which we have ISDA Master Agreements.  I will review those agreements this afternoon.

However, we do not have a master agreement in place for the following counterparties:

	Rand-Whitney Container Board, L.P.
	Pacifica Paper (n/k/a Norske Skog Canada Limited)
	Lin Packaging (Lin Pac, Inc.)
	Dial 
	Master Packaging  (Master Packaging (N.B.) Inc.
	Sodra (Sodra Skogsagarna)
	Appleton Paper
	Boise Cascade
	
Further, the following master agreements were negotiated out of London with the Enron affiliate -- Enron Capital & Trade International Corp. ("ECTRIC"):

		Caima (Companhia de Celulose do Caima)


Let me know if you have any questions with the foregoing.

Susan Bailey

Susan,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Thanks for your help,
Jennifer Adams
