Hi ladies,

I'm hoping you can help me with a little information on the terminations on the Master Log.  Can you provide any further information on the CNR gathering agreements being terminated for Walker & Associates?  Is ENA the agent in those agreements or the shipper? 

Any additional info will be appreciated.

Thanks,
