on and send them to the ladies of the SWAP group.  If I may be of any assis=

Subject:=09Mirant Canada's purchase of TransCanada Pipelines trading busine=
ss

On October 11, Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. purchased a substantial =
portion of TransCanada Pipeline's trading and marketing business. As a resu=
lt, Mirant will be purchasing the entire business of TransCanada Energy Fin=
ancial Products Limited, and will be taking assignment of the physical gas =
transactions/contracts of TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and TransCanada Gas=
 Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.

As a result of this transaction, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. will be termina=
ting whatever credit support they provided for these entities and that cred=
it support will be picked up by Mirant Corp, depending on the arrangements =
that we have negotiated. With respect to TransCanada Energy Financial Produ=
cts Limited, it was agreed that the ISDA that is currently between Enron Ca=
nada Corp. and TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited will be assign=
ed to Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd under the same credit terms as cur=
rently exist.  Mirant Corp will issue a $30 million USD guaranty to provide=
 the credit support for this document, the same dollar amount that TransCan=
ada Pipelines Ltd was providing.  They have also agreed to provide whatever=
 necessary collateral to cover their exposure, over the threshold, as a res=
ult of their purchasing this entity.

With respect to TransCanada Gas Services Inc., the only outstanding gas tra=
nsactions are with Enron North America and these all relate to physical pro=
duct. There is no contract between TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and Enron =
North America, but TCPL is currently providing a guaranty for this business=
. This guaranty will be terminated, and these transactions will be covered =
under a current Mirant Corp guaranty covering Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=
g Ltd. for physical gas transactions with Enron North America. This current=
 guaranty is for USD $10 million and is of a sufficient amount to cover the=
 current exposure as well as the exposure being brought over from TransCana=
da Gas Services Inc..

Finally, with respect to TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanad=
a Energy Ltd, there is currently a physical gas master with Enron Canada Co=
rp. However, this was executed in 1993 and is outdated with respect to cred=
it provisions. I have been working with the credit contact at Mirant Canada=
 to get a new physical master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=
g Ltd. This new master would govern all existing trades between ECC and Mir=
ant Canada, as well as those coming over from TransCanada Gas Services, a d=
ivision of TransCanada Energy Ltd. However, in the interim, the TransCanada=
 trades would still be covered by the existing master. TransCanada Pipeline=
s will terminate their guaranty of this entity with respect to these transa=
ctions.  Alternatively, Mirant Corp has agreed to amend their existing guar=
anty covering physical gas transactions between Mirant Canada Energy Market=
ing Ltd. and Enron Canada Corp by increasing the coverage from USD $30 mill=
ion to USD $50 million. This entity also has some exposure with Enron North=
 America, which will also be covered under the existing Mirant Corp. guaran=
ty for USD $10 million.

A contract between ENA and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. would also b=
e an ideal outcome out of this; however, the first priority is getting a ne=
w physical gas master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd.

If there is any other information that I can provide on this matter, please=
 do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks
