Ellen,

I have just found out that US Brick may also transact business under the name Tiffany Brick Company, L.P.

So please conduct another search under that name.   And if there are confirms, please furnish the hard copies to me.

Thanks,

Susan

Susan,

Is "US Brick Co." the actual name of this counterparty ? I have just searched for any physical gas transactions under this name and got 0 results.

Ellen,

Please check to see if there are any "live" physical deals with the captioned counterparty.  If so, please provide a hard copy of the confirmation(s) evidencing such deals.

I wuld appreciate receipt of such confirmations by Wednesday, February 6th.

Many thanks for all your help.
