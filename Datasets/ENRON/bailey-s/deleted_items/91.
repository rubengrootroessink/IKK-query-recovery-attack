Can one of you attend a meeting at 2:00 that Ed McMichael has called to discuss the Financial Book status?  He may have some questions about the termination log.  The meeting is tentatively in the new building, 5th floor - you can check with Sara, she will also be attending.  I'm not feeling well and going home for the rest of the day.  If you need me for anything, my home number is 713-807-7242.

Thanks,
Stephanie
