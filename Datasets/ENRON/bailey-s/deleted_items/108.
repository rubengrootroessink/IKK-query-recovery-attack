Susan,

BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. was marked as a "Y" for termination on the latest Letter Log and Master Termination Log we received from Stephanie Panus....so do we include them in the list or not?  I was in the process of sending their list of deals over to Risk to be swung into the Bankruptcy books.  

Melissa - can you run this query for Power and send me a spreadsheet?  I'll merge it into whatever we find for Gas, Crude, Paper, Weather, etc...  for each counterparty?

Bob - can you do physical gas?  

Thanks,
Diane
