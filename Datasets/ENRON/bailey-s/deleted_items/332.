I received a voice mail from Leo Radkowski (phone: 303-978-4965, fax: 303-978-3563, email: radkowsk@jm.com) today.  Johns Manville is in receipt of our termination letter and wishes to pay past due amount and discuss prospect for settlement.  

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log with the above note.

Sara: I'm inclined to reply that we are going to stand by or termination and will be happy to discuss settlement down the road.  What do you think?  

Thanks
