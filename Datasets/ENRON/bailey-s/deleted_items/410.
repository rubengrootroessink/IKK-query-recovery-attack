Clement,

Brent Hendry has been working on an Enron Corp Guaranty, which would guarantee the physical and financial trading obligations of various Enron affiliates with that of various Duke affiliates.

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a "redlined" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfaced font.

Please let me know which changes you will or will not approve.

Thank you in advance for your help.
