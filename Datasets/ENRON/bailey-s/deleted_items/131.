Susan,

I don't remember if I sent this to you already - so
here's the spreadsheet....there are almost 9,000 RMT deals.

 
Do you need these confirms too?  Please say no.  :)

Diane

Diane,

My request was for the financial deals.  But if you have access to the physical RMT/Intercompany -- I would like those too.

Ok.

And regarding the Risk Management deals......I forget what we decided....what "begin" date do you want on the query......deals from 12/1/01 forward or was in sometime in November?

Diane,

Thanks for confirming that the trades were with ECTRIC and not ENA -- thats what I had thought.  

Yes-- please furnish copies of the confirms for the 2 deals to me.

Thanks,

Susan
