Diane,

My request was for the financial deals.  But if you have access to the physical RMT/Intercompany -- I would like those too.

Diane,

Thanks for confirming that the trades were with ECTRIC and not ENA -- thats what I had thought.  

Yes-- please furnish copies of the confirms for the 2 deals to me.
