Susan,

Is "US Brick Co." the actual name of this counterparty ? I have just searched for any physical gas transactions under this name and got 0 results.

Ellen,

Please check to see if there are any "live" physical deals with the captioned counterparty.  If so, please provide a hard copy of the confirmation(s) evidencing such deals.

I wuld appreciate receipt of such confirmations by Wednesday, February 6th.

Many thanks for all your help.
