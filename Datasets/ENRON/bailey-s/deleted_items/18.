Susan:

I just received a return of my mailing of your Christmas gifts to you. The forwarding order expired, which means I mailed the box to the wrong address.  I am such a jerk after all!

Susan is addressing it, so you and Steve can use the gifts as Orthodox Christmas gifts now, since late.  Sorry.

We didn't forget you guys.
