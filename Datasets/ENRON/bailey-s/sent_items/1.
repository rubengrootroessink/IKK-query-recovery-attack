Tom or Veronica,

As you know, prior to the bankruptcy filing ENA and/or EPMI entered into agreements with some of their trading counterparties, whereby the parties agreed to mutually terminate contracts and/or transactions, and wherein the parties agreed to termination amounts to be paid.

In light of these pre-petition arrangements, please confim if the following termination payments were received by ENA or EPMI:
