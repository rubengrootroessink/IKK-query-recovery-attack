John,

Attached are the Demand Notes prepared for the following Project NOL vehicles:

1.	FS 360 Corp.
2.	Mangas Corp.
3.	Tularosa LLC.
4.	Chiricahau I - XIV.

Please be advised, Deb Korkmas prepared the Demands Notes, and forwarded same to Stephen Douglas for his further handling and execution.

Deb does not know if the Demand Notes were ever executed.

Let me know if I may be of further assistance.

Regards,
