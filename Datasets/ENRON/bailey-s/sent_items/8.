Gentlemen,

Attached is an electronic version of the "proposed" First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement, which was directed by FED EX to Gareth Krauss @ Merced on October 11, 2001.

On November 5th, Gareth mentioned to me that their lawyer would be contacting Sara Shackleton (ENA-Legal) with any comments to the proposed First Amendment.
  
 
Let me know if I may be of further assistance.
