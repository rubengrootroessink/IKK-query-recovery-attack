Bob,

Here is the transfer form to request files to be transferred.  Please have 
everyone fill it out by June 12th and email it to me.  I will call to set up 
an appointment at each person's desk to transfer the files.  I will then 
review them and burn the CD.  You will have the CD by June 15th.

Thanks,
Heather
