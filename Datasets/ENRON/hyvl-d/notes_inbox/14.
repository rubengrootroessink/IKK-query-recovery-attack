	Jokemaster's Note
	
	
	As of this writing, it is pre-Lakers vs. Sixers. A friend is having a bunch 
of guys over his place for the first of, most likely, four games. I feel a 
"Guys Night Out" is necessary once in a while. It's going to be a much needed 
neathrdral-like night of cold beer, hot wings and yelling at the television 
set. The JockMaster from SportsJokes will be there as well. You would think 
the guy would have an interesting take on a big sports series but the last 
time I pinched his brain about such a thing, he simply belched. Go figure.

	Today's Joke
	
	
	
	
	BORN TO SELL
	
	A young guy from Texas moves to California and goes to a big mega- department 
store looking for a job.
	
	The manager says, "Do you have any sales experience?"   The kid says, "Yeah, 
I was a salesman back home in Texas."
	
	Well, the boss liked the kid so he gave him the job.  "You can start 
tomorrow.  I'll come down after we close and see how you did."?
	
	His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it.  After the store 
was locked up, the boss came down.
	
	"How many sales did you make today?"  the boss asked.?
	
	The kid says, "One."?
	
	The boss says, "Just one?  Our sales people average 20 to 30 sales a day.?
	
	How much was the sale for?"
	
	The kid says, $101,237.64."
	
	The boss says, $101,237.64?  What the hell did you sell?"
	
	The kid says, "First I sold him a small fish hook.  Then I sold him a medium 
fish hook.  Then I sold him a larger fish hook.  Then I sold him a new 
fishing rod.  Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down 
the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the 
boat department and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft.  Then he said he 
didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the 
automotive department and sold him that 4 x 4 Blazer."
	
	The boss said, "A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat 
and truck?"
	
	The kid says, "No, he came in here to buy a box of tampons for his wife and I 
said, "Well, your weekend's shot -- you might as well go fishing."
