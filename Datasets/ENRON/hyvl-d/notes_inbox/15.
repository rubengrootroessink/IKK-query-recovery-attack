Sorry, Dan.  I have no earnest money contract.  I'm taking this on cold
turkey as no one else has worked on this sale with Earp.  I need everything
from the get go.

Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I
was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.
