Russell,
 It is time for a master with this counterparty.  Please send the credit 
sheet to Debra so that she can prepare the master.

We do not have any master type documents with Sempra Energy Solutions, LLC.  
I will send out the GTC confirm where both enron and sempra have to sign.
Thanks

Richard,
 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.  
Thank you.
