Sergio,

Attached is the referenced Fuel Supply Agreement which has been redlined 
against the June 5, 2000 draft to show changes requested by you in Sections 
9.3 and 9.5 (per your discussion with Doug Leach).  We will be couriering 
execution versions of this agreement to you in the morning.

Best regards,
Diana Parker
