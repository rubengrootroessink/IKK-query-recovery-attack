I guess saving PQP LLC $14 million through the renegotiated fuel supply 
contract is not on the level of your highly complexed project financing 
mindset.

  Thank you for your e-mail with the draft of the amendment to the fuel 
supply agreement.  I disagree that the amendment has nothing to do with the 
1996 letter.  It is correct that the 1996 letter was superseded by the 
amended and restated fuel supply but the situation created by the 1996 letter 
was not contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  The lenders 
were not given a copy of the 1996 letter until recently and naturally asked 
to be in the same position created by the 1996 letter which was not 
contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  Notwithstanding the 
lenders strong case, I am still trying to argue this and many other issues 
and there is a slight possibility we may be able to convince the lenders they 
do not need this document.  

We will continue to do our best to protect Enron's interests (at all levels) 
in this highly complex and difficult financing.  As always, constructive 
criticism and suggestions to improve our work are very much appreciated.

I will keep you informed of further developments

Thank you

FPL

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist 
PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally 
superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

Why is this necessary when we just executed a reduced price fuel supply 
contract with PQP LLC and we are in the process of trying to sell the asset 
and transfer the fuel contract to the new buyer and Glencore?

Doug:

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks



FPL
