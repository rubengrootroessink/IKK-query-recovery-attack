As referenced below, if you are available, we can conference with the Quantum 
/ Enernet folks and (ideally) put this deal to bed.  I will be in a meeting 
until 10:30am central, so I'll call you then.  Thanks.

Dan,
Mr. O'Bannon and I are ready to conference.  Any time Wednesday, 2-2-2000,
(preferably in the morning around 10:30 central time) just email us both
with a time that is good for you.
Thanks,
Doug
