Yates asked us to prepare amendments to the referenced agreements to include 
their West Kitty prospect under the current agreement.  (Of course, if its 
easier, you could create another document).  Here are the particulars:


Reserve Commitment Area  --  Section 36 of 51N/74W 

Gathering Services Fee = $0.21 per Mcf

Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) = 6,000 Mcf/d

Purchase Price  (i) baseload  IFGMR CIG Index less $0.04
  (ii) swing  Gas Daily CIG Index less $0.04

Let me know how you would like to proceed (amendment v. separate contract) 
and if you need additional info.


Thanks.
