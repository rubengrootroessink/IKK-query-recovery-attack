Dan--

Good job with Quantum / Enernet...we're finally close (i hope).

Attached is the Coleman Purchase Agreement  --   I have included their wiring 
instructions which I just received.  After Howard Hertzburg calls you, we can 
incorporate his comments, if any, and generate final drafts.

Thanks

D
