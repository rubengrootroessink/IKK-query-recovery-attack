You are not going to believe this.  I have yet another change!  Pursuant to
recent changes by the United States General Services Administration, the
standard language we currently use in the Utilization of Business Concerns
requires updating.  The new language is provided in red in the attached file
below.  Could you please update the provision in our contract to reflect the
new language?  I guess it's good that it happened at this time.  Otherwise,
I would have had to issue an amendment.  Thanks ...

Christian,
     I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached
contract document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended
that the Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on
any invoice that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way
that we have to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.
Therefore, i have not removed that line from the address,  At such time as
the Purchase Order Number is available, please send a revised address
notice to the company containing such number.  Until that happens, it will
be understood that no number has been provided.  Please call if you have
any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed
a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...
