Mike,

Please see the attached L/C format to cover physical delivery of natural gas 
for one month.

As discussed, the L/C amount should be $1.6 million to expire Oct. 15, 2000.  
In addition the L/C should be in the name of Hilcorp Energy Company.  I also, 
left you an additional voice mail, stating that once we have received a faxed 
copy of the L/C from your bank, we will then be willing to flow gas.

Regards,
Russell
