Would know anything about a physical foward between HPL and Hilcorp Energy 
Company, confirmed by Legal in April-2000?

Unfortunately, there are no comments as to who prepared the confirm.

Let me know
thanks
Jennifer

Do you know who in Legal confirmed the first leg?  I did not.  I think that 
you should go back to the original attorney.
