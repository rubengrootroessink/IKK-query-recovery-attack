Dan -

I accept the terms of the confidentiality agreement, so please feel free to 
execute so that we can see the Ormet financials.

With respect to the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, I realize that we 
have yet to determine the final collateral threshold amount (hence the need 
for Ormet's financials).  However, I would like to point out that Paragraph 
4.3 has a typo with respect to the Customer's threshold.  The figure should 
be "$1,500,000" but currently reads "1,5000,000" (with an extra zero).  Just 
in case we should settle on a $1.5 MM threshold, we need to ensure that this 
is corrected.


Thanks,

Jay Williams

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mike
