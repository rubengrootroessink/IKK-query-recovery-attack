Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Regards,
Bridgette Anderson
