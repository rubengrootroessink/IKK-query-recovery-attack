At Craig's request, I am forwarding the final revsion to the Ormet Firm 
Purchase/Sale agreement.  The last change is additional language in Section 
4.3 and is the result of discussions between Enron and Ormet credit.  The new 
language is in blue.

Please get back to me with any comments as quickly as possible so that Enron 
can move forward with Koch Gateway.

Ina, Craig asked that you forward a copy to Jay in credit so that he can 
review the new language as well.

Thanks to you both,
Mike
