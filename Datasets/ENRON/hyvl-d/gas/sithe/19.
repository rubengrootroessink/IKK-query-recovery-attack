Sithe had one last change to make under their signature block.  Could you add 
to our document
and initial 2 originals again.  I will pick up the originals as soon as you 
are done.

Thanks,
Ruth

I have attached a corrected version.? The only difference is having the 
correct date in the header of pages 2 and 3 and adding "By:? 
Sithe/Independence, Inc. its General Partner" in the signature section under 
"SITHE/INDEPENDENCE POWER PATNERS, L.P."

Regards,

Jason
