Mr. McCullough --

Attached is a Word file setting forth our comments on Mr. Hyvl's draft
Amendment to Master Gas Purchase Sales Agreement, which was sent to us last
year.

 <<EnronOnline Confirmation Amendments.rtf>>

I trust that you have a copy of what Mr. Hyvl sent to us.

Please let us know your thoughts on this.  (We will need to discuss the form
of exhibit B, as referred to in the amendment.)

Thank you,

Dave Anderson, PG&E Law, 415-973-6659
