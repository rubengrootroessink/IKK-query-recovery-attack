I do not know the origin of the Btu factor as stated on the annual report.  
Can you respond to Dan on this?

Steve,  
 Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of 
the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work.  
The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the 
measured mcfs including both purchase and transport?
