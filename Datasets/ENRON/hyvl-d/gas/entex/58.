Gregg,
 I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the 
credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the 
ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by 
Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell 
Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant.
