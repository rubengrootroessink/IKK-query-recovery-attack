Dan, 
As we discussed.  

I am not sure what my new e-mail address is going to be - during the AEP 
setup my name was mispelled (easy to understand).  I'll give you the address 
as soon as I get it fixed.  In the meantime, if you send out paper would you 
please hard copy me at  1201 Louisiana, Suite 1520, Houston 77002.

Thanks,
Greg

Seller:  HPL R
Buyer:  Entex Gas Resources
Location: Clark meter 1511
Date:  June 2001
Volume: 5,000 a day
Price:  HSC -.015
Final price with swap pay out of 208,875 equates to:

HSC minus   -  .015 (location diff)
  -1.3925 (swap value)
  
  -1.4075

HSC minus $1.4075 = final price.  


Ed, would you please put this in your system, I won't do a deal ticket for 
obvious reasons. Greg, you will need to get with legal to get a contract to 
Entex.  We do have an Enfolio in place.

Thanks all,
Janet
