Dan-

Please confirm that you have received the executable copies of the Wisconsin
Public Service contracts and Enron Corp guarantees.

Also, could you please give me an estimated date that Enron will mail the
partially executed contracts and executed guarantees to WPSC?  We would
appreciate them being sent by overnight mail.

Thanks,
Kim
