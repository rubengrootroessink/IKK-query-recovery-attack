I forgot to give you her number in the last email.  It is 53218.  I apologize 
for her not calling you as well as myself.  I talked to her immediately after 
we spoke and she assured my she was going to call immediately.  I did not 
spend much time on the phone with her but the little bit I did get was that 
she did not see that meter on any of her nomination reports and was not aware 
of any gas from them.  Also, generally, if a producer does not agree with a 
nomination from their supply points, they just don't confirm it.  If it was 
suppose to be confirmed, the phone calls will start at that time.

 Again, I apologize for not giving you her name immediately.  Hopefully the 
problem is or will be resolved quickly.  Let me know if there is anything 
else I can help with.

Steve

No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

Steve
