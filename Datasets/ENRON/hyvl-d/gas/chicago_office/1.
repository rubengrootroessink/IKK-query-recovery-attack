Dan,

Attached are the details for the enovate transaction(s)/purchases of physical 
gas from Reliant @ Trunkline Stx pool.  I received your draft of the agreed 
Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day 
parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the 
Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement 
past our partners PEC legals folks.

Thanks,

If you have any questions please call me at (312) 541-1226
