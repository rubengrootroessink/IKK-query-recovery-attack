Dan - I just received another inquiry from Reliant regarding the status of 
the Master Purchase/Sale Agreement with enovate.  Can you provide me with the 
current status.  Although the deal doesn't start until December, there seems 
to be a heightened interest of late.

Thanks for your assistance,

Gregg
