Jeff,
Attached are the terms for the two natural gas balancing deals for the period 
of April 2001 through March 2002. Please review them for clarification and 
call me with any questions you might have. If you need definitions or to 
clarify the language please call me at 312-541-1233. Also, let me know when 
the confirmations will be generated and, if possible, copy myself with one. 

Thanks
Steve Richman
