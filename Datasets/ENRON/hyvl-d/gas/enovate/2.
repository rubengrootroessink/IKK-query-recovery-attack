Dan,
I understand that Jeff Hodge has forwarded the terms of the storage exchanges 
to you for confirmation. There may be a couple of item to clarify within the 
terms. First, under the "late notification" section please change the forst 
sentence to read: Late nominations available by 3:30 pm on the nomination day 
prior to gas flow. Also, change the last sentence under 'Payment Terms" to 
read: Oneok will pay each month $72,916.67 to enovate by the 25th day of the 
month following the service month.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks
Steve RIchman
