We had a brief meeting w/ Joe Dephner on this deal yesterday.  Apparently, 
Enron probably only company that could get bonds for this deal (5 years 
only).  Joe will be calling PEAK to discuss the lack of 10 year bonds and 
some of our proposals for alternatives.  based on their response we will 
decide to Go or NO GO.  I will keep you informed.
