The information for Enron Canada Corp. - Engage Energy Canada, L.P. ("Engage 
Canada") looks correct with respect to the Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  We are in the process of revising the amended and restated 
agreement between Enron Canada Corp. and Engage Canada.  It should be out 
shortly.

  NOTE:  I think Enron North America Corp. still needs a guarantee from 
Westcoast Gas Inc. to guarantee the trades done on the East desk between ENA 
and Engage Canada.  I believe you wanted that guarantee to be for US$5million 
and I assume that Dan Hyvl is taking care of it.

Thanks,

Mark
