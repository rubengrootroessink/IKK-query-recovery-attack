Debra, Stacy

Please read this long winded message:

Attached is a new credit worksheet for Engage Energy.  Please resend them the 
Master draft with the correct Guaranty amendments as I noted in the comments 
on the worksheet.  Debra, you commented in the Master Gas Lotus Notes 
Database that their legal is unwilling to sign a Master Firm.  I have talked 
to thier contracts person (the contact person listed on the credit w/s)  and 
I want this to get executed. Please proceed with this.

Thanks
Russell
