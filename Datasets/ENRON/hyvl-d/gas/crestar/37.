Dan and Michelle;

Further to Bruce's note the other day,  could we use something like the
following in the two Enron/CEMC agreements? - to be inserted in Other
Conditions immediately following the para. providing for the 9:45
notification.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Enfolio Spot
General Terms and Conditions each party shall, in addition to the other
remedies hereunder, be liable to reimburse the other for any imbalance
charges, loan costs, or similar charges reasonably incurred by the other as
a result of the failure:

a) in the case of Enron, to provide the delivery information required by
9:45 am on each Nomination Day; and

b) in the case of Customer, to forward such information to Alliance Pipeline
on each Nomination Day in a timely manner.
