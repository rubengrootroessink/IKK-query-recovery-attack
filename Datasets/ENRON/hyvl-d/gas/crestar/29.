I just confirmed with Dan at Enron that clause #5 can stay as is. I
verified that Crestar will notify Enron by 9:00am of the volume to be
supplied by both Crestar and Enron and Enron will notify both BP and
Crestar by 9:45am in a single e-mail of the contracts to nominate to with
the applicable volumes.

So the assignment can be sent out with Dan's other changes incorporated.

Thanks everyone,

Michael,

     I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following
comments.

1.   Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:

Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office
located at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as
"Consenting Party")

2.   Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some
applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment,
however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for
making its own nominations each day.

3.   Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and
Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.

     Please call if you have any questions.

                                   Dan Hyvl
