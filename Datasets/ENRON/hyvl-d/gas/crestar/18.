We have attempted to operationalize the Alliance - AOS contract between Enron 
North America and Crestar (now Keyspan) as follows:


8:00 am - Alliance announce the % of AOS that will flow the next gas day 
(weekend)

9:00 am - Crestar (Keyspan) determines economic viability and informs Enron , 
by phone, of AOS volumes to Enron's central cash desk 
               (Patrice Thurston)
  *** The deal will be 'done' at this time as per the AOS contract.
 
  (Note --  Crestar is in the process of assigning a portion the AOS contract 
to BP.  After this assignment has been approved by Enron, 
   BP and Crestar will notify Enron of daily AOS volumes)
  
9:45 am - Enron informs Crestar (Keyspan)   { and BP after contract 
assignment}  the contract numbers, volumes, pipelines, and other required 
 nominations information
 - Crestar (Keyspan) {and BP after contract assignment}  will nominate on 
Alliance to ENA

10:30  - Nominations deadline (1st cycle)

12:00 - Pipelines will (should) confirm all nominations

(all times are MST)
