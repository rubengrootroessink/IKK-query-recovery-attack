Dan, Keyspan / Gulf  bought out Crestar - Crestar holds the Alliance 
capacity.  BP is taking assignment of only a portion the volume of the 
contract with Enron.   

Dan, can you call Bruce Kohrs @ Keyspan for final clarification and 
confirmation.  403-205-7684

Thanks

Grant

Grant,
 Question?  What is Gulf doing in these transactions.  Is it in place of 
Crestar or BP or what?  Who can answer?
