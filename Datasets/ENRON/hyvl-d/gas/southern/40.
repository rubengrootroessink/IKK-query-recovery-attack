Alan, here are clean and redlined versions of the above agreement.  The only
thing in here that we have not discussed  is language obligating Enron to
provide us with copies of their LNG agreements with El Paso so that you have
an opportunity to evaluate them before having to decide whether to take
assignment of them.

Call if I failed to capture everything we discussed correctly.
