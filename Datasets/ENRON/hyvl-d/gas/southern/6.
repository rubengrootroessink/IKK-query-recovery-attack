Subject: Southern Company Services Contract

Attached is the only CES contract with Southern Company Services as "true" 
counterparty (listed on the contract instead of having a letter issued later 
naming Southern Company Services as Agent). I could not find any specific 
deal data; but the contractual provisions should give you what you are 
looking for. Please let me know if I can help with anything else or if we 
need to dig deeper (into CES non-listed data hopefully with Porter & Hedges).
