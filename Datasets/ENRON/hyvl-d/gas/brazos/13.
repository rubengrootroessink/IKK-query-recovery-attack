As I made Alan Aronowitz's changes yesterday, I also generated a
non-Enfolio form of Gas Contract in case we need it.  A clean version of
this is attached, as well as a copy marked against the second draft of the
Oil Contract distributed last night.  There are three kinds of changes: (1)
additional recitals to make it clear that this is an output contract, not a
firm contract, (2) modifications to reflect the fact that the gas will be
sold on a daily basis, and (3) various additional provisions from the old
Cactus gas contract.

Perhaps this will be helpful.
