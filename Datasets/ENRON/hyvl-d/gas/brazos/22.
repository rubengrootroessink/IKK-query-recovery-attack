With respect to the ECT Merchant Investments Corp. and ENA contract and the 
St. Mary's Production, LLC and ENA contract (Gary Bryan's "Preston" deal), 
Melissa Graves and I will assume responsibility for having our records and 
deals properly updated.  We would also be happy to perform the same task for 
the Entrada/Crescendo contracts if you wish.

In any event, we need copies of the conveyancing documents for at least the 
"Preston" deal and, if you wish us to update the Entrada/Cresendo deal also, 
the conveyancing documents for that deal too.

When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

thanks
