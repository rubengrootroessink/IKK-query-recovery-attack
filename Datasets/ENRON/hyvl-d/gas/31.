Sorry that you did not receive my e-mail of Sept. 9th with the attached
addendum.  We have reviewed the draft of the Enfolio Master Firm
Purchase/Sales Agreement and find it generally to be a good agreement.  The
attached file contains an addendum with three changes that we would like to
make to the contract.  The first item is merely a grammatical clarification.
The second relates to the fact that we typically do not get the annual
report out within 120 days.  This year, we got it out in about 180 days.
The third item relates to a requirement that we must follow as a municipal
corporation.

Although the purchase process has not yet been approved by executive
management, we wanted to get the contractual issues resolved so that the
agreement could be immediately put in place once the approval occurs.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at (210)353-3725 if you have an
questions about the addendum.
