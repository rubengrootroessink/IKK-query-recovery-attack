Dan, Please prepare amendment.  This new pricing overrides all the amendments 
you have worked on in the 
last month.  

O'Neal, please change pricing in system.  This pricing overrides the pricing 
I gave you a month ago.  

Paul, please review San Jac. contract and new pricing spreadsheet and we will 
meet when you are ready.

Thanks everyone!

New Pricing begins in August 2000.
See worksheet "Pricing  HL&P".  Also, sheet 3 has actual swaps with swap 
values.
