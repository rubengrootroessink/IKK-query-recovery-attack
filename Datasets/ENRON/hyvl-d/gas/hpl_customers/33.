Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.
