I'm not sure what a traunch is but according to Mick Walters this deal has 
been in evergreen and this deal is a firming up (renegotiating) of the 
contract.  That said, it is basically a new deal to us.  We have newly marked 
volumes.

Contract 96001783

Sandi,

The deal David is referencing relates to an unbooked traunch under contract 
96001783.   This traunch had not previously been booked because the contract 
had had a price re-opening provision.  I'm fairly certain contract 96001783 
is already included in the data room documentation.

George and Dan,
Do either of you have documentation on this deal? Niether Shawna nor myself 
have any knowledge of it, and, as you can see, Patrick would like to include 
it in the data room--let me know please

Thanks,
Sandi

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

Dave
