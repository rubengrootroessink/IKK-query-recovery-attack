Janet, here is the latest draft with all the changes previously agreed to
incorporated.  The green hi-lited portions are additions as a result of
Enron's last language addition.  I will be in a meeting until 4:00pm. I will
give you a call at approximatedly 4:15 to see if we can finalize today.
Thanks
