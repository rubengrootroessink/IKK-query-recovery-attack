Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.
