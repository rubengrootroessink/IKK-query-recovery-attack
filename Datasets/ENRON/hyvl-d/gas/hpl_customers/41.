Bob,
 My contract admin approached me today and asked why we had no paper on UDS 
and I realized we have never completed paperwork on our agreed to 
transaction.  Here is what I will have prepared for you today:

Term:  August 1, 2000 - July 31, 2001
Price:  9,000 mmbtu per day priced @ IF-HSC less (.01)
  excess over 9,000 mmbtu per day priced at Gas Daily less (.01) two days 
after flow
  less than 9,000 mmbtu per day bought back @ Gas Daily Katy low two days 
after flow



Let me know,

Gary

Bob, 
Hope your vacation was great.  I was up in Michigan and had a great time.  
There are a couple issues still to be worked out on the contract.  Please let 
me know and I will get an agreement drawn up.  

1)  Baseload Volume -   Based on historicals your average is roughly 9,000 
mmbtu/d with swing from 6,000 - 12,000
 We can work this two ways: 1)  Use 9,000 per day as baseload with swings 
priced @ a GD and undertakes bought back at a GD
     2)  You can nominate some number between 6,000 and 12,000 prior to bid 
week and this becomes your baseload        number.  With swings priced @ a GD 
and undertakes bought back at a GD
2)  Gas Daily price - 
 Since this is no notice swing we use HSC GD mid less (.01) for all takes 
over baseload quantity two days after flow.
 If  you take less than baseload quantity we buy this back at Katy GD low two 
days after flow.
 The two day after price is used in order to line up volumes with cash 
price.  I would find out on the day after flow of your excess take and then 
pay the next  days price to meet your needs, hence two days after.

3)  Term would be one year out of August 2000 with evergreen clause 
(automatically extends month ot month) with 30 day written notice of 
cancellation during evergreen term

Give me your input.

Thanks Again!

Let's go with the IF baseload/GD swing formula approach for July forward.

I am on vacation; will talk to you week of July 3 to finalize any details.
