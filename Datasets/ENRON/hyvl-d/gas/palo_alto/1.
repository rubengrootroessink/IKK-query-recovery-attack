Dear Mr. Hyvl: I'm re-sending the e-mail, because I had used
dan.hyvl@enron.com <mailto:dan.hyvl@enron.com>  and it came back
undelivered.  I received your correct e-mail from Robert Bruce later.  Grant
Kolling.

Dear Mr. Bruce and Mr. Hyvl:

In response to Mr. Bruce's telephone call of this morning, attached for your
consideration is a draft resolution, which the City proposes to substitute
for the opinion of counsel letter in connection with the Enfolio contract
with Enron North America Corp.  As I have mentioned to both of you, the City
Attorney is not inclined to execute the opinion of counsel letter as
proposed.  The City does not issue such opinions whenever it has negotiated
energy contracts in the past.  Whenever the City Attorney has issued
opinions of counsel in connection with revenue bond issues, those opinions
of counsel have been quite limited in scope.

I had asked my legal assistant to fax this document before I spoke to Robert
Bruce this morning, but this e-mail may arrive before the fax.

Please note that the City's staff has not reviewed or commented on this
draft resolution, so there may well be changes.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

s/

Grant Kolling
Senior Asst. City Attorney
