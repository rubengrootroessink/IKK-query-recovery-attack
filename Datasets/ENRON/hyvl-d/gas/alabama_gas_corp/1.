Subject: Alabama Gas Corporation

Per my rambling voicemail: Alagaso (Alabama Gas Corporation) has sent two 
termination letters requesting termination of two of the 3 CES contracts 
(sorry for the confusion on the voicemail - - -- brain starts to slip after 
lunch). All three of the contracts aren't our favorites per our earlier 
conversations/e-mails dating back to the beginning of round 2, duplication 
clean-up. The largest problem; the 1991 contract that they are terminating 
has the greatest Max. Daily Quantity (20,000/day) (this was the one we were 
favoring out of the three). However, the combined daily quantity on all the 
outstanding deals by far exceeds the MDQ. A schedule of the outstanding deals 
on the 9/1/91 (96029223) is attached. If we have the new contract in hand, I 
can enter the new contract & hopefully move these deals over (the ones for 
which gas has not yet flowed) - - - - - - we can split & move any deals for 
which gas is currently flowing - - - - - - - we will need the Confirm group 
to reconfirm. This is assuming that we do indeed have the new agreement 
executed by both parties.

Back to the letters, they want our signature to waive the 90 day notice. The 
1990 contract have been on trading suspended status since 7/18/00 & has no 
outstanding deals. So, if we are 'okay' with that - - - - - there are no 
loose strings (if okay, do you want to sign?). However, on the 1991 contract 
there are LOTS of loose ends - - - - - -- what is your recommendation? 

Fun stuff eh? I've left messages with Tammi DePaolis, the trader working with 
Alagaso, about the above referenced scenarios. Apparently Alagasco was wanted 
these letters back tomorrow (9/26/00).

I've attached copies of all of the contracts in question for your review. I 
have the letters in hand.



Thanks!!
Cyndie
