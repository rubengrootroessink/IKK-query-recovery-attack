Dan:

Citizens has come back with some questions on the amendment you drafted.  I 
have discussed these changes with them and redrafted the agreement to adopt 
some of their ideas but in a manner to make it more acceptable to us.  This 
is attached.  Please review and edit this document and return to me so I can 
forward to Citizens.

My number is 503/464-3822.


Chris
