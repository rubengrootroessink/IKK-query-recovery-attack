Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the 
deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.

Hello Gentlemen,

This is another contract that I have been requested to extend past the 
original term of  deal #222899 entered into Sitara.  Again this Counterparty 
does not have an executed Master.

Thank you again,
Bridgette Anderson
