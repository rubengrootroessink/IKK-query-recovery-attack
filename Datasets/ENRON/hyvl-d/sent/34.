Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price?
