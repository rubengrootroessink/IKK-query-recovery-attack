Dan, is Tammi Price someone at Enron or at Gibson?  I'm just looking to get a 
sense of where things stand and whether the ball remains in our court or 
Gibson's...

Walter

Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential 
Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is 
in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and 
forwarding to Gibson.
