Dave,
 As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the 
applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the 
Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery 
point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please 
finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by 
Enron.

Dan -

Per our conversation today, I made a change to the "exhibit B" confirmation.
If you could let me know that it's OK, we will make change and execute.

Thanks,

Dave Anderson 415-973-6659
