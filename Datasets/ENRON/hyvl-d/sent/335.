Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.
