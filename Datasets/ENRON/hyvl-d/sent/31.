Irene,
 These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As such 
I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment 
date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract 
file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree?

Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you!

In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have 
encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in reference 
to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales.

What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date?

 What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date?

What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the 
assignment date?
