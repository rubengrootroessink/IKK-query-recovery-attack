Ellen,
 As we discussed, please change the Special Conditions: to read:  
 
 In consideration of the delivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas by Customer to 
Company pursuant to Part A above and the redelivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas 
by Company to Customer pursuant to Part B above, Company will pay Customer 
the sum of US Dollars $123,070.00 on April 25, 2001.  Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.2 of the Base Contract, a 
party's delivery obligation pursuant to Part A and Part B above shall

 I have discussed the above with Deirdre and she is okay with the language.  
Remember to  add signature lines for each party and provide Deirdre with a
