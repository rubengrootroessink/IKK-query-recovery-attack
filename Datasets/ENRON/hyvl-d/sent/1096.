It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

Actually, our subdivision streets flooded a little, but that was all.  How 
about you?

And how did you fare in all the rain.  I guess you went boating Saturday.
