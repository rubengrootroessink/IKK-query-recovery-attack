If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then 
that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business 
with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same 
contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.

Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do we 
have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example, 
if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a 
separate contract or do we use the same contract?

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

Dan,

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA?  

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?
