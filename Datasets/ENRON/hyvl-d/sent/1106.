A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her 
first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and 
begin eating a fine meal.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness 
and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. 
Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out 
a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. 
Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked 
over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a 
rather stern voice, "Skippy!"

The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A 
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, 
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The 
father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"

Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman 
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let 
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit 
Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!"
