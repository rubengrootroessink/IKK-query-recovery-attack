Christian,
 I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
(see message below)

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be
made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for
such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we
sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Christian,
     Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.
Please print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the
purchase order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If
the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring
the number from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed
copies to me or Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.
