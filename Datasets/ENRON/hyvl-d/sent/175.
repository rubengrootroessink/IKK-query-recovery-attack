Brodgette.
 Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the 
confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by 
the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he 
would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed 
agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to 
Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?

******************************************************************************
**************************************************************
The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal 
express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am 
sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented 
by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.

Mike,
 I have added the language as item 4 under Other to the Transaction 
Agreement.  If okay, please accept the changes, print, have signed and 
forward to me for further handling.

Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Regards,
Bridgette Anderson
