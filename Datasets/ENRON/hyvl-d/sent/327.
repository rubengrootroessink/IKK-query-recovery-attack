Mark,
 I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff.  If the 
contract is acceptable, please print off 2 originals and have them signed and 
forward to Jeff for signature by ENA.  Once the contract is finally executed, 
Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files.
