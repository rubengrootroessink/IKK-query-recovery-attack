Phil,
 Please review the attached and let me know what other changes need to be 
made.  I have added a sentence in Other of each to provide for the Force 
Majeure Language to be attached as Exhibit A.  Please let me know if you 
think this will work.
I will be out Monday, but in early Tuesday.  Please call my assistant to set 
up an appointment for Early Tuesday.
