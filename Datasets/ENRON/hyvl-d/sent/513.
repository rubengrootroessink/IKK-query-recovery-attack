Jeff,
 We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks 
ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it 
to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of 
compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also 
assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 
9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation 
plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I 
will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will 
need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date 
that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated 
that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit 
in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan 
which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see 
no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP 
appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the 
case?
 Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand 
how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for 
a career opportunity with HPL.
