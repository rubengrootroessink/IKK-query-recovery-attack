Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP 
who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties, 
Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount 
that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at 
5-3595.  Thanks for your help.

Walter
