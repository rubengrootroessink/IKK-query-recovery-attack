Linda,
 Try the transport group, Steve VanHooser, Gerald Nemec, Eric Gillaspie, and 
maybe Shonnie Daniel.  I did not assign any transport contracts, especially 
from HPl to ENA.

Dan,

In the Global Contracts database, reference is made to an assignment letter 
from HPLR to ECT eff. on 10/1/98 for a transportation contract with Texas 
Utilities Fuel Company.  However, we have been unable to locate the paper 
document.

I appreciate your help in locating this document.

Linda
