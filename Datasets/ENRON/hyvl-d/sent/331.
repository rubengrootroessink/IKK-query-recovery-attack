Travis,
 Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract 
in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments 
proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the 
proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to 
trade on Enron Online.  
Please let me know if you need anything further.

PG&E made a proposal to John Lavorato and Bill Bradford today to secure some 
additional gas supplies from ENA and Enron Canada.  I am faxing a copy of the 
presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a 
deal that we are interested in looking at.

John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are 
the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E 
claims there are none (of course).

Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you 
review the proposed amendments to that Master?    

Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you 
take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron 
Canada couldn't execute the same form?

Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I 
understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended 
to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on 
our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months 
ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave 
them into these amendments?
