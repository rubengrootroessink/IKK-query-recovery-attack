Enjoyed having lunch.  I got back and Time Warner was available for my zip 
code, so I signed up for Time Warner Road Runner internet service.  The price 
is $15.00 per month plus installation.  I will let you know when it is hooked 
up.  Are you sure that you want to come back to the rat race.  It has to be a 
lot of fun staying home and playing with the baby.  That will all change if 
you decide to come back to work.  See you.

Is there an estimated rollout date on the Internet Service portion of the 
pilot program?  If it is going to be awhile do you recommend subscribing to a 
service during the interim period? 


Thanks


Stacy
