I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract 
provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed 
is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois.  
This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming 
party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can 
agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please 
get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed.
