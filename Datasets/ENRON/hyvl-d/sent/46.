Dave,
 I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the 
agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for 
this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a 
credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract.  
Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components 
is proceeding.
