The GTC confirm that we sent to them did not require them to sign.  It is 
month to month until cancelled by either party.

My understanding, after discussing the matter with Jim Carr, is that the 
debtor is going to enter into an agreement  which Enron is preparing.  
Regarding Court approval neither of us believe it is reguired.
