Walter,
 The document is okay if you put it on ENA letterhead, and add the 
counterparty's name in the blank in the signature area.  Please call if you 
need anything futher.

Dan, could you please take a look at this confidentiality agreement that I 
received back from GWF?  The attached version below was changed only to add 
their name and commodity; otherwise it's identical to the version I sent them 
(and that I had gotten from you).  Please let me know if it's acceptable and 
I'll get it signed.  Thanks!

Walter

Here is a marked up copy.  Essentially we just added the name, address and
the trade commodity.

Robert, attached is a draft confidentiality agreement.  Please take a
look at it and let me know if it will be acceptable or if you have
changes that you'd like to make.  Thanks for your cooperation and your
interest in EnronOnline.
