Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.

Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I 
bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.
