Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had 
a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers 
Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on 
the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many 
things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed 
confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, 
what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of 
memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back 
please.
