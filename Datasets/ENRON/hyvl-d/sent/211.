Dave,
 Spoke with credit and they are permitting us to go forward without adding 
credit provisions.  In reviewing your email, are both of the existing deals 
being modified for the period Feb  through July.  your chart says half for 
each deal.  I will do a new GTC confirm that terminates the old and rolls the 
old volumes and new pricing for the period FEb 01 through Jan O2.  Please 
give me a call (713) 853-6895.

That's great Dan, the extension is actually only 6 months (Aug 01 - Jan 02).  
Also, can we make it an "ammendment" to the existing deal?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,
