Note that the previous contract is terminated 8/31/02 in the new agreement 
and the new confirm is attached at the end of the new agreement.  Any

Please allow me to review the terms of the Master before we send the draft.

Darren,
Haldor Topsoe has agreed to terms of 110% of IF-HSC through August 31, 2004.  
I will have legal prepare the Master physical and the confirmation.

As long as we have the Master executed, you can do the extension.

I understand the physical agreement is a must.  However, my real question is 
regarding a two year extension.

Gary the ONLY way that we can do these deals is AFTER the signing of the 
Master Physical Agreement.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.


-Darren

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.
