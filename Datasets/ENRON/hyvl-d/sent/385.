My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim
