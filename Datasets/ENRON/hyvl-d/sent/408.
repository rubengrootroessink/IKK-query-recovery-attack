Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I 
was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would 
want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the 
attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to 
putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and 
Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them?
