Why couldn't this be done with a new GTC confirm for the extension period?

Dan,

I have inserted a screen print of the deal from Sitara, this should give you 
the information that you are seeking.  Please let me know if this isn't 
sufficient information.

Thanks.  
Bridgette Anderson

Can you give me any more information.  What type of deal is it.  Who did the 
deal.  How was it documented.  Where is the paper work.  etc.

Hello Gentlemen,

This is another contract that I have been requested to extend past the 
original term of  deal #222899 entered into Sitara.  Again this Counterparty 
does not have an executed Master.

Thank you again,
Bridgette Anderson
