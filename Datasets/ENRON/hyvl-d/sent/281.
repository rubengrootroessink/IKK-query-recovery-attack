Susan,
 I agree with you. Use the CES GISB for EOL transactions.

Not sure who's available for this, but here goes.

Mississippi Valley Gas Company has shown up for review in EOL.  There are two 
executed masters.  One is a CES GISB (96028960) dated 1/1/98.  The other is 
our MPSF (96001043) dated 1/1/93.

My vote is for the CES GISB.  Can I please get an official call on the best 
one for EOL, including collateral language?  They are attached for your 
review.

Thanks!!

Susan
