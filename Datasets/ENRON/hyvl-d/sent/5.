A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have 
anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.  
Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him 
after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he 
might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect 
to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He 
reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she 
faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the 
class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!"  
All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension 
appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.  
She committed suicide!"
