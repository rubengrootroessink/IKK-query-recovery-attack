Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave 
for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it 
is now your watch.  The only thing that might occur is Mark Breese.  I have 
placed a voice mail to him in response to his Detroit rfp but he is out.  The 
deal should be okay assuming Mark can make the prices work.  Anyway, I will 
handle with Mark.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  I will be back Friday to 
resume the watch.  See ya!
