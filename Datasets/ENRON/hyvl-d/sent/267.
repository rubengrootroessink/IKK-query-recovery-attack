Cary,
 Jeff Hodge asked that I incorporate the agreed to items from their request 
which was forwarded to Jeff by Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001 into a 
document.  I have taken the document that Jeff forwarded to Sherry Brinkman 
on December 7, 2000 and included the acceptable changes that Jeff indicated 
were acceptable in his email to Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001.  If this is 
your understanding, please let me know what else needs to be done to finalize 
the documents.
