Christian,
 Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.  Please 
print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the purchase 
order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If the number 
is not available, them please delete the information requiring the number 
from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed copies to me or 
Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.
