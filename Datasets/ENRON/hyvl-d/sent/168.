The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal 
express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am 
sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented 
by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.

Mike,
 I have added the language as item 4 under Other to the Transaction 
Agreement.  If okay, please accept the changes, print, have signed and 
forward to me for further handling.
