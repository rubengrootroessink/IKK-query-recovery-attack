Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Dan:

Can you handle this for Mark?  I have taken a quick run through and one thing 
that I know will cause us problems is the posting of a bond.

Thanks,

Jeff
