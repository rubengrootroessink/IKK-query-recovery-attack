Veronica,
 She did not make the changes you requested to cover both contract and 
non-contract transactions.  What do you want me to do.  Her language works so 
long as we have a written contract covering each of the physical obligations.

Carol and Dan--

Per the message and attachments below, please take a final look to see 
whether their comments to our proposed revisions are acceptable to both of 
you.

Thanks again,

Veronica Espinoza

Veronica - As I mentioned on the telephone, I have revised the AGL Guaranty 
Agreement to Enron and it is attached.  Also attached is a highlighted 
version showing the changes.  To the extent your lawyers have further 
comments, I would be happy to talk with them directly.  I understand that you 
are revising your proposed Guaranty Agreement to AGL to include both 
financial derivatives and commodities (both of which will be executed with 
Enron North America Cop. as the counterparty) and to add a $50,000,000 
limit.  We look forward to getting that from you.  Maggie
