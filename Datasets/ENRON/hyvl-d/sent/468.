Okay,
 Stacy and you can go tommorrow, I cannot make it.   Maybe you can ask Jeff 
to drive you and Stacy tommorrow.   The only time I have next week is Monday.

Okay, how about this...

If Stacy goes tomorrow, we'll go.  If Stacy can't go tomorrow, we'll go 
somewhere else one day next week since next Thursday is out for you.

Has Jeff been good?  Should we ask him too?

It appears that tommorrow is out.  Next week is definitely out.  The 
following week is iffy.  I am leaving it to you to set something up with Mrs. 
Granmayeh.
