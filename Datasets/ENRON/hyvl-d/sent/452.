Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

Clement

Clement,
 Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable 
in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.
