Ruth,
 Please review to verify that I have included all of your changes.  I believe 
that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, 
otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you 
concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to 
deliver to you originals on ENA stationary.
