Paul,
 You say 5,000/day plus fuel.  The delivery point is in the south texas 
pool.  Where does the fuel come in and how is it determined?  Also, did we 
ever determine the name of the Reliant Energy entity that was doing the deal?

Dan,

Attached are the details for the enovate transaction(s)/purchases of physical 
gas from Reliant @ Trunkline Stx pool.  I received your draft of the agreed 
Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day 
parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the 
Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement 
past our partners PEC legals folks.

Thanks,

If you have any questions please call me at (312) 541-1226
