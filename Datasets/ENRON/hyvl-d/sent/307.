> Top 10 Most Brilliant Marketing Screw Ups
>
> 1. Coors put its slogan, "Turn it loose," into Spanish, where it
> was read as "Suffer from diarrhea."
>
> 2. Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux used the following in an
> American campaign: "Nothing sucks like an Electrolux."
>
> 3. Clairol introduced the "Mist Stick", a curling iron, into
> German only to find out that "mist" is slang for manure. Not too
> many people had use for the "manure stick."
>
> 4. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same
> packaging as in the U.S., with the beautiful Caucasian baby
> on the label. Later they learned that in Africa, companies
> routinely put pictures on the label of what's inside, since most
> people can't read.
>
> 5. Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a
> notorious porno magazine.
>
> 6. An American T-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the
> Spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of "I saw the
> Pope" (el Papa), the shirts read "I saw the potato" (la
> papa).
>
> 7. Pepsi's "Come alive with the Pepsi Generation" translated into "Pepsi
> brings your ancestors back from the grave", in Chinese.
>
> 8. Frank Perdue's chicken slogan, "it takes a strong man to make
> a tender chicken" was translated into Spanish as "it takes an
> aroused man to make a chicken affectionate."
>
> 9. The Coca-Cola name in China was first read as "Ke-kou-ke-la",
> meaning "Bite the wax tadpole" or "female horse stuffed with
> wax," depending on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000
> characters to find a phonetic equivalent "ko-kou-ko-le",
> translating into "happiness in the mouth."
>
> 10. When Parker Pen marketed a ball-point pen in Mexico, its ads
> were supposed to have read, "it won't leak in your pocket and
> embarrass you". Instead, the company thought that the word
> "embarazar" (to impregnate) meant to embarrass, so the ad read:
> "It won't leak in your pocket and make you pregnant."
