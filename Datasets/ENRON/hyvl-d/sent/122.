Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting 
?ready for his annual trip...but there were 
?problems everywhere. 

?Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves 
?did not produce the toys as fast as the regular 
?ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure 
?of being behind schedule. 

?Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming 
?to visit. This stressed Santa even more. 

?When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that 
?three of them were about to give birth and two had 
?jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. 
?More Stress. 

?Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the 
?boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground 
?and scattered the toys. 

?Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for 
?a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went 
?to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the 
?liquor and there was nothing to drink. 

?In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot 
?and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all 
over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom 
?and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made 
?from. 

?Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed 
?on his way to the door. He opened the door and 
?there was a little angel with a great big 
?Christmas tree. The angel said: "Where would you 
?like to put this tree fat man?" 

And that my friend, is how the little angel came 
?to be on top of the Christmas tree
