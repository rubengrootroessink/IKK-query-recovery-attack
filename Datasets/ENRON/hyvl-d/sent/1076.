Lee,
 Please have these printed on the new HPL letterhead.  Please correct the 
addresses and phone numbers.  Ask Janie to attach the current GTC to the 
letters.  Call if you have any questions.

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee
