Cathy, 
 I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a 
limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.

More pipeline transportation agreements.  These do not need to be processed
immediately, but I would like to have them done as soon as we can.  Thanks.
