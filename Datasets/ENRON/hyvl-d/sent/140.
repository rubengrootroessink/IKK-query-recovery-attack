So you do check your mail.  Yes, I am doing this.  I ordered my equipment 
yesterday.  I went with the Advanced Desktop.  The difference was $333.  I 
also paid for additional upgrades of speed and memory.  Call me if you want 
specifics.  It works best if you use the telephone line when ordering, at 
least that is what the Dell representative sold me on.
