copy finals and send to the Calgary Office. To the attention of Grant Oh. He 
will attach a cover sheet and issue to the customer and get signatures.

 Please review the language in 87crfm.  Call me after you have had a chance 
to read.  If okay, I will print on letterhead so that it can be resent to the 
counterparty.
