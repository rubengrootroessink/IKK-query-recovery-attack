Grant,
 The only change of any significance that Anne requested is the deletion of 
the words "and Enron confirms the nomination," that was previously in the 
first line of the third paragraph under Other of the Spot Confirmation.  
Please confirm if this deletion is okay.  If not, please let me know and I 
will put the words back.  The other changes were form type and did not change 
the document.  Please call me asap.
