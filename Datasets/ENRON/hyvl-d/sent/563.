Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 
copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have 
reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they 
are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they 
negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 
713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke 
documents for you to print off and have signed.
