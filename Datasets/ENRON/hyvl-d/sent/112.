Ellen,
 You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you 
execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the 
information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan

Dan, the only thing I'm missing on the Enovate contract is the
notices/billing/payment page.  If you want to just email me the info, I'll
plug it in.

Thanks so much for your help.

Ellen Dailey

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.
