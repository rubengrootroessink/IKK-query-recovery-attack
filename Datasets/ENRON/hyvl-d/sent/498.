Okay with me.  Go ahead and make your arrangements for the headset.

I would like to order a headset for my telephone, much like the ones that 
Taffy, Mary Helen and Carlos have.  Are you open to that and if so, will you 
approve it?  It is just a matter of ordering it through Superior Headset 
Service, Inc.
