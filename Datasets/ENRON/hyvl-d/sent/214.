Want to verify your vacation carryover?  Beginning January 22, 2001, all

were carried over from the previous year by going to the eHRonline website.

1. Navigate to the eHRonline website:  http://ehronline.enron.com.
2. Read the disclaimer; click Accept.
3. Enter your User ID and Password; click Logon.
4. Select Time Management from the menu at the left.

To see specific types of vacation (accrual, lump sum, vacation), click the 
radio button below "All types" and make your selection from the drop-down 
menu.
