Jason,
 Please change "Enron Corporation" to "Enron Corp."  and let it fly.

Dan -

I have revised the Velsicol confidentiality agreement per our discussion 
earlier today.  Could you please take a look at the attached and let me know 
if it meets your approval?

Please give me a call at 53923 when you have had a chance to review.



Thanks,

Jay
