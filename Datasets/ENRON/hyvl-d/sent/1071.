I am unaware of any physical trading constraints relating to doing business 
with a cooperative.  We have been doing business with such entities for 
years.  Can he be more specific about where the restriction is concerning 
financial trading for a coop.

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Thanks
