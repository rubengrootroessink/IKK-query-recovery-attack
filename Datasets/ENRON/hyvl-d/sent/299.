If the deal is to be a fixed volume, I would prefer to use the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement and document the deal thereunder.  Please let me 
know.

Russell, Have you sent me a credit sheet on this?

John!

We are ok with the structure of the deal as discussed ( Purchase 4000 @ day 
MichCon @ NYMEX + 0.21(0.20) with an option to fix the price -  APR - OCT).  
However we would like to have this done under a contract. 

Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or a 
"Master Purchase, Sale".  


Thanks
Rudwell.
