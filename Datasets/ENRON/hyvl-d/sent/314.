Sandi,
 As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I 
believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts 
that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in 
place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also 
wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA 
wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think 
that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are 
certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, 
these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also 
wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need 
a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

Dan,
I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well as 
those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco. 
Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also, 
is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather 
than Lodisco? Let me know--

Thanks,
Sandi
