Christian,
 I spoke with Janet Wallis this morning and she said she was fine with the 
redlined changes.  Accordingly, please print 2 originals of the contract, 
have it signed and forward both signed contracts to Janet Wallis for ENA's 
signature.

communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.  If she notifies
