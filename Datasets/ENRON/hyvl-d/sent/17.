Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell
