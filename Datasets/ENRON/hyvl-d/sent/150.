		 Subject: East and Upstream Origination Christmas Lunch

The East and Upstream Origination Group Chrismas lunch will be Wednesday, 
December the 20.  I am trying to get an approximate count of all employees 
who will be attending.  I realize this is short notice, but in order to make 
reservations, please RSVP to me today.  You can contact me via reply e-mail, 
or at extension 5-3317. Later today, I will send an e-mail with the details 
of the event.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Regards, Keegan 
Farrell
