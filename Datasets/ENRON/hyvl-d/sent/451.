Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and
went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, "Since you've
such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is,
you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it
for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St.  Peter took 
Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God, 
"Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said 
Arthur,"professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in 
your invention. 
1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 
2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds. 
3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 
4.  The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.  And finally, 
5.  The maintenance costs are outrageous." 
"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on." God 
went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the 
results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.  "Well, 
it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but 
according to these numbers,more men are riding my invention than yours."
