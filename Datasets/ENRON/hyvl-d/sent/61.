Barry,
 Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this 
confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 
and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu 
of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant 
by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market 
price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?
