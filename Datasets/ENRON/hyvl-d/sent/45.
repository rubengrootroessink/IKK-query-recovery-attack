Russell,
 Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as 
necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas 
under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated 
the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this 
agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was 
requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the 
purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements 
as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me 
with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I 
can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further 
negotiation later today.

Lee,
 Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes 
have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick 
points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 
1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 
except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them 
their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their 
request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded 
slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do 
request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; 
gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the 
"as is, where is" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do 
their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added 
their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the 
contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company.  
Anything else?
