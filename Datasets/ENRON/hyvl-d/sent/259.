Michael,
 Grant Oh of the Calgary office seems to be okay with your requested 
modification of the interrruptible spot confirm.  As such, please prepare an 
amendment document to add your language as an Appendix to the terms of the 
spot confirm, have it signed and forward to Grant Oh and myself for 
approval.  Thereafter we will have it signed and by Enron and will return a 
fully executed copy to you.

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Grant

We are wondering if you received our fax of January 30, 2001 and if so
whether you have had an opportunity to consider it.
