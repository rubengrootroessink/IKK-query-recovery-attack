Tanya,
 I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office.  
The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is 
guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and 
the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's 
subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The 
Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice.
 Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for 
which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can 
forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature.
