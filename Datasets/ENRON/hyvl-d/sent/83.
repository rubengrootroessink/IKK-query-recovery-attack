The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:

Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered 
into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; 
John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as 
Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of 
William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; 
Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred 
Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et 
ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris 
Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  

First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation 
in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in 
Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.

The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage 
covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do 
not have copies of these 2 amendments.  

At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged 
into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL 
Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.
