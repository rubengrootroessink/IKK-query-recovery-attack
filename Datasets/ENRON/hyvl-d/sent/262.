Fran,
 I understand from John Blaylock that I am to direct an email to you 
regarding the treatment of certain vested Enron benefits.  My name was 
included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to 
regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for 
HPL's business lines.  I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know 
whether AEP will or will not make an offer.  However, in the event they elect 
to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my 
vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings 
Plan.  Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in 
the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll 
those amounts into a rollover IRA?  What actions would I need to take 
regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan?  

 Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services 
through Time Warner Roadrunner.  Will these costs continue to be subsidized, 
and if so, by whom?
