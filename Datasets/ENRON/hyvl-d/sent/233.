Thanks Dan,

As soon as you locate the document, let me know and we will be glad to 
reassign the contract back to HPLC.

Thanks,
Linda

I think that the reassignment should be August 1, 2000 instead of August 1, 
1999, however, I will confirm once I find the executed assignment.  Am still 
looking.
