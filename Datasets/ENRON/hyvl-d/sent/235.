John, 
 You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
back to me.

Charles,
 Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
was to redo the termination payment amount.

Dan - can we apply this amount to prepetition gas.  Unfortunately, I do not 
think we can?  Please advise.

John,  FYI - Heartland made a $63,000 payment yesterday.  The total credit 
for them now is $308,940.12.
