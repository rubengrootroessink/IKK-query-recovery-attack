Chuck, 
 Another matter to deduct from the payments to be credited as a result of 
Heartland's deficiency receipts.
Let me know if you have any problems getting the info from Patrice.

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .
