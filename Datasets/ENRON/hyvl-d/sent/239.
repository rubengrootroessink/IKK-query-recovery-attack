Troy I assume that Enron has a standard confidentiality agreement and if you
would E-mail a copy to me I will try to get it in place so that we can begin
sharing information.

Larry,

Thank you to you and your team for allowing us the opportunity to come and
present.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt to
track down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as of
yet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).

Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, risk
management strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's risk
appetite and hedging objectives,  I offer the following questions:

1.  Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have you
hedged?  Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposure
hedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons?
2.  What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respect
to hedging instruments?
3.  What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counter
swaps and options?  Is their any policy which requires you to transact on
the exchange?
4.  How far out on the curve can you hedge?
5.  What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculate
natural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)?
6.  What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tied
to?  If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is the
normal term of such contracts?  If sold on spot, to what index(es) are they
tied?
7.  What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for the
next year, 2 years, etc?

Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.  I do
realize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protect
the transferral of sensitive information.  Please let me know how to
proceed.

Best regards,

Troy Black
