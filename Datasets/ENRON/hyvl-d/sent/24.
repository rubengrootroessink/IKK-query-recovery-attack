		 Subject: Litigation Unit In-house Ethics CLE Seminar

SENT ON BEHALF OF BRITT DAVIS:

This is to invite you to the annual Litigation Unit In-house Ethics CLE 
Seminar, which we have scheduled for Thursday, November 9, 2000, at the 
Doubletree at Allen Center.  As in the past, we are proud to present as our 
speaker Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University of Texas School of Law.  An 
open bar will be available from 4:30-5:00 p.m.; the presentation will take 
place from 5:00-6:00 p.m; and there will be a post-presentation open bar 
(with plenty of boiled shrimp and other finger food) available from 6:00-7:00 
p.m.  We anticipate obtaining one hour ethic's credit from the Texas Bar for 
this presentation.  We will be videotaping it for the use of those whose 
schedules do not permit them to attent.  As always, this is at no cost to you.

If you plan to attend, please RSVP to Deborah Shahmoradi by e-mail as soon as 
you can.  

We look forward to seeing you there!


Britt K. Davis
Enron Litigation Unit
