Ellen,
 One more thing, when the deal is confirmed, it should be confirmed as an 
Houston Pipe Line Company deal.  If you have any questions please call me, 
Barbara Gray or Jeff Hodge.

Dan & Janet,

Is this a confirmation of a deal or just an offer ?
Have you got a deal number ? 
Our systems can not generate a confirmation without a deal number, so if this 
is just an offer, can we just send out Janet's attached document ?

Regards
Ellen

Ellen,
 With this added information, can you generate the contemplated confirmation?

Forget the greenhouse requirements and  just make it requirements up to 50 
MMbtu a day.  The meter number is #1598.  
Also, the GTC method is fine with me.

Thanks,
J

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.
