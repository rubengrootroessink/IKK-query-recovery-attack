Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  The marked 
form is now in black.  I made the requested change in the Term section.  That 
section defines a Early Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 
contract years.  As such no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract 
section.  Please call if you need anything further.  

        Thanks, Dan
