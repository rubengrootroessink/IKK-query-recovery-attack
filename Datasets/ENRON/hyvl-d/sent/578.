		 Subject: Contract Alteration

This is the first of several contracts I need you to alter to make specific 
between HPL and a third party counterpart, taking out the Enron and its 
affiliate spin.  Please forward your altered draft back to me when 
completed.  Send to SSchneider@aep.com with a copy to MLCarriere@aep.com.
