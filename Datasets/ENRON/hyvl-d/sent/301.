Just to confirm what Dan Hyvl told me:

Use GTCs on both those deals until he can review the Single Transaction 
Purchase Firm contract (96005067).  Based on preliminary information, he 
feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master.  If Dan later 
determines that those transactions should indeed be under the contract, we 
can change the contract and inform the Confirms group (and Logistics if 
necessary) accordingly.  

Please keep Elizabeth informed of what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do.

Thanks,
SBR

Stacey,

FYI

I had to go ahead a set up a GTC for this deal and another deal just like it 
with the same cp and term dates 643625.

Maybe we can go over these today.

Thanks,
Sharon

Remember I have to leave early today, so if we don't get to it today then 
please remind me first thing tomorrow and we'll finish our review of it.  If 
Elizabeth calls you regarding the deal, you can set up a GTC if necessary but 
I'd rather be sure before we do anything else.  Since gas doesn't flow on 
this deal until 03/01/01, it shouldn't be an issue today.

THANKS!
SBR

Hey Stacey,

Thanks for the clarification, no problem......I just want to make sure you 
know this is the committed reserve contract that you said we will research 
later, that is why it is still there.

Sharon

Sharon,

I'm not trying to make a big deal of it.  I also think that Elizabeth would 
let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.  

This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see 
when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read "added user tag").  I just 
realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't 
subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.

I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a 
Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have 
to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that 
already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same 
thing.

I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs. 
face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our 
policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your 
portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.

Hope this clears everything up!

Thanks,
SBR

Hi Stacey,

I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on 
Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have 
two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after 
being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary 
deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the 
portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that 
portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure 
they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi Sharon,

I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday 
around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too 
many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your 
portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal 
won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO 
outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every 
day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or 
requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I 
also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have 
attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached 
(non-problem) deals each day.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular 
deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make 
sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy 
handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.

Thanks!
SBR
