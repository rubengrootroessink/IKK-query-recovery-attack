   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
 wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
 faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q:  Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A:  You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you find
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.
