Russell,
 I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to 
have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the 
master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical 
guaranty that you currently have from coastal.

Dan,

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell
