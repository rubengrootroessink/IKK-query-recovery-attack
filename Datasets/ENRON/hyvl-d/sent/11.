Paul,
 Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the 
Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some 
other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We 
probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the 
fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to 
___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant 
Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a 
Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior 
deal.

Dan,

The company is Reliant Energy (wholesale trading group) at this point and the 
fuel is handled the same as the 30,000/d deal that you wrote up. (See 
attached) 

thanks,
