This is to close out Vanessa's records with the temp agency.  You'll probably 
be receiving another request for the temp that sat at Vanessa's desk while 
she was out.

Explain?  We hired Vanessa to take Jenny's place.  What is all of the below 
about?  Shouldn't this be for the temp who was their last week when Vanessa 
was out for her son's surgery?  If so, what was her name and I will complete.

 Would you request this person again Y/N?  Maybe, most likely, yes.

Comments: Liked this one enough to recommend that she be hired to permanently 
fill the position.
