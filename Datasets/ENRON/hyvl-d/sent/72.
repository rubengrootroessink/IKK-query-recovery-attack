Ellen,
 We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications 
after that date.

Dan,

I've had a look into this, and my system show that Jennifer Blay sent the 
confirm to the counterparty October 2, after it was revised by Stacy Dickson.
I will confirm this with Jennifer in the morning.

Would you like a copy of what was sent out ?

Regards
Ellen

Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy 
Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which 
had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions?

Barry,
 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please 
advise.
