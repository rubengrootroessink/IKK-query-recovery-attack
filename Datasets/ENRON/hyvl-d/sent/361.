Walter,
 I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They 
just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language 
makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and 
the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As 
redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to 
go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank 
you.

Dan, here is the reply from Gibson Petroleum regarding the confidentiality 
agreement required for us to obtain their financials.  Could you please take 
a look at it and see if this will suffice?  Thanks!

Walter
