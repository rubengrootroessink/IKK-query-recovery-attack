Dan,

How about meeting around 3pm on Wednesday afternoon?  This will give me time 
to send comments to you and Les on the letter agreement/Exhibit A.

Dan, 

We need to set up a time next week to discuss the attachment with you.  What 
looks good for you?

Phil,

At the request of Alan Kilpatrick I am forwarding to your for your
review and comment a proposed letter agreement relating to the sale of
regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in
McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the
terms of such sale.  The latter has been modified from the version you
last reviewed to add certain additional provisions we felt necessary and
to flesh out the unique force majeure provisions that we felt should
apply to this transaction.
