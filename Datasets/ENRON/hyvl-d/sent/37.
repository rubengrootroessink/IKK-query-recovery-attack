Based on Stacy's comments yesterday, I have changed the last sentence of 
11.1.  Her comment was that the last sentence of 11.1 said events of force 
majeure may inclucde and 11.2 said events of force majeure shall include.  
Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of 
11.1.
