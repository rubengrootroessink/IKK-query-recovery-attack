I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made 
certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement 
presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.  Since the new agreement is to 
cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's 
financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term 
references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until 
such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next 
week.  The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will 
receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.   Please have your 
attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of 
the changes noted in the document.
