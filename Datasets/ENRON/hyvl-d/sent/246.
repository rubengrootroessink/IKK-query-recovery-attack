Grant,
 I received a fax from Michael Kleiner with Gulf Canada Resources Limited in 
behalf of Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. suggesting certain changes to the 
OTHER section of the existing transaction agreement.  I do not see that he 
copied you with any of this.  Do you know anything about it.  If not, I can 
fax you a copy.  Please call. (713)853-6895.
