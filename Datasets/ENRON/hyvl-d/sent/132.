Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.
