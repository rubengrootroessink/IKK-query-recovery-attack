Kim,
 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice 
period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the 
greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days 
prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss.

Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - "subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements."

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Thanks,

Kim
