Troy,
 It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the 
proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to 
their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things 
don't happen.

FYI,

It is unfortunate that we lose business due to a simple confidentiality 
agreement.  Dan, I do appreciate your efforts with this matter.

Troy

Troy -

I appreciate the time you took to have Enron's legal department review the 
non-disclosure agreement.  Unfortunately, Silgan cannot accept the requested 
changes, and specifically the deletion of paragraph 5.  As a result we have 
decided not to pursue a business relationship with Enron.

Thanks again for your time.

Michael Vogt
