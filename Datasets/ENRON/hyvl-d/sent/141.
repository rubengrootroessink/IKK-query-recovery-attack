Debra,
 Please prepare another Master.  Deal should be identical to the one we did 
for your buddy.  That one was between ENA and ECT Merchant Investment Corp. 
This one should be with Brazos VPP Limited Partnership, a Texas limited 
partnership, and ENA. Check with Teresa regarding the ownership of Brazos.
