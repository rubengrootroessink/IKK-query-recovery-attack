Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

Dan,

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks, 

Kim

Kim-

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.

Calvin,

     Attached is a draft copy of our Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement.
Please let me know what I can do to help facilitate the process required to
get this in place.

Thanks,

Kim
