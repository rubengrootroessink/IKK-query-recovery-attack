Jim,
 I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales 
Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on 
your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start 
on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the 
Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several 
omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will 
not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed 
out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub 
first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's 
discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.
