Don't know what you are talking about.  They gave Sylvia their form with 
their view of how the world should revolve around their wishes in October 
2000.  She sent it up here is late January for Legal's initial review.  I 
understand it mimics the Utilicorp agreement.  If you have some incite that 
would lead you to believe that they would sign our Master, please send me a 
credit worksheet so that I can prepare a Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  Also please give me a contact so that we can forward the new 
contract to that person for execution.

To All:

Please provide myself and Sylvia updates on the ISDA and Master Firm Purchase 
Sale contract negotiation with EnergyOne Ventures LP.  Sylvia is looking to 
transact with this counterparty and they are willing to sign our contracts.

Thanks
Russell
