Jared,
 The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed 
their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why 
should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the 
other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and 
their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances 
together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed 
Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and 
forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call 
me and we can discuss.

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle
