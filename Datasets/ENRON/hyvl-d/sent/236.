The November 2000 contract is the new deal with reliant.  We need to verify 
that we have a master between HPL and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  If not, 
the old contract needs to be assigned to HPL.  Certain deals that were shown 
to the purchaser of HPL included business being done with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  That means that if we don't have an HPL master, we need to do 
one for them.  Two deals were shown as HPL, however, they may have been GTCs, 
if so, we would need to create a master, and if the old master still exists, 
i would like to assign it to HPL so that they would have a contract to use 
after July.  Call me if you have any questions.
