Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to 
BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the 
entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.
