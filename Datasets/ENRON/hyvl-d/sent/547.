Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these 
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.
