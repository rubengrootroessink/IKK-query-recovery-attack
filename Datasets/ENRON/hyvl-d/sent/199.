I believe that the attached is ready.  I have printed 2 copies and have 
initialled those which are in my office EB3878.  Please send someone up if 
you need to sign first.  Otherwise if they are signing first, forward the 
above document to them, have them print it, sign it and forward it to ENA for 
ENA's signature.
