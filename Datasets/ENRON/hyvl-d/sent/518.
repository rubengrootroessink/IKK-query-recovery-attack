Cheryl,
 I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the 
deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew 
that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post 
of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or 
Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the 
confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting 
you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group 
has already indicated that they did not have it.

I just wanted to let everyone know to please call Amelia Alland 
(713-571-3271) or myself (713-571-3187) with any issues regarding HPL 
contracts, deals, etc.
We will be very glad to help in any way possible.

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
SBR
