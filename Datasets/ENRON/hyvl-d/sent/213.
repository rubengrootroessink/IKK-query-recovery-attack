Christian,
 I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract 
document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the 
Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice 
that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have 
to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have 
not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order 
Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company 
containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no 
number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...
