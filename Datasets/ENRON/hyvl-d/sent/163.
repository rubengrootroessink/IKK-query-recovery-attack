Send me the contract so that I can determine if we guaranteed no free liquids.

I was informed of a situation where Ameripol was receiving liquids in our 
gas.  They claim they suffered losses of $180,000 in equipment and product 
damage.  They are asking for reimbursement.  Please let me know what happened 
Gary and Dan what damages they could collect.
Thanks,

Gary
