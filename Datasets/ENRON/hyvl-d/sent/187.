Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Thank you for your participation in our first two pilots.  Your effort, time

We are excited to announce the beginning of Internet Service Ordering today, 
Wednesday, January 10.  Many of our vendors are ready to begin providing

internet service are

MSN will be available in late February, providing both dial-up and DSL
