Brent -

Attached are the spreadsheets proposed by HoustonStreet for the short 
descriptions.  The concept with the attached is that HoustonStreet will post 
the spreadsheets to the website and use them to ensure that customers can 
identify - by cross-checking the spreadsheet - the description applicable to 
the price/product.  In other words, this spreadsheet is intended to give the 
customer a cross-reference list between our description and the matching 
HoustonStreet description.

Please take a look at this at your convenience and let me know your 
thoughts.  I understand through Bob Shults that there is some urgency to this 
review.  Any assistance is appreciated.

Mark:

Per Bob Shults' request, attached please find a spreadsheet comparing HSE's
short product descriptions to EOL's.  Also included in the spreadsheet is a
screen shot of HSE's gas trading floor to put the descriptions into context.
Please review this information purusant to Exhibit I, section 4 of the
Amended and Restated Posting Agreement.  Feel free to call me if you have
any questions.

Regards,
John
