Bob -

Thanks for the information and access id's. 

As I indicated in my voice mail earlier today, the standard process is to run 
these deals through one central point and to ensure that a review of all 
descriptions and information related to each respective product to be traded 
is undertaken by a Legal Dept. member.   As you will note from the list of 
cc's, I have included legal dept. members involved in the physical power, 
physical gas and financial products areas.  These people will need to review 
the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Tradequote site, as 
well as any other items associated with these products.  Accordingly, each of 
these individuals also needs a password/user id for due diligence purposes.

I have almost completed my review of the Access Agreement and the other 
documents on the site (available without a password).  I can complete the 
review process only after Brent, Dan and Shari have completed their on-line 
product reviews and provided any comments.

We can further discuss this at 3:30.
