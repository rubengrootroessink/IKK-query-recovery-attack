Dan, Brent, Shari -

Please let me know as soon as possible what the status of your review of the 
True Quote site is as we are getting closer to the anticipated completion 
date of March 12 - Monday.

I have already prepared comments to the access agreements for the site, but 
need to have your comments, if any, to present all Enron comments.

Thanks for the assistance.

Dan, Brent, Shari - 

We have been asked to review the provisions of Truequote - a third party 
trading platform - on which Enron may possibly trade.  I have requested 
access for each of you to the site (www.truequote.com) and hope to have this 
for each of you a bit later today.  In order to get you started, I have 
provided the general product descriptions below.

The use of this system is in conjunction with another deal we are currently 
working on with Truequote which will enable counterparties to hit Enron 
posted prices and transact with Enron through the Truequote site.  

Timing on this matter is rather tight as we need to finalize all agreements 
and be ready to begin using the Truequote site on Monday, March 12.  
Therefore, please initiate a review of the descriptions pertinent to your 
area as soon as possible so that I can coordinate any comments you may have 
with my general comments to the access agreement.  Travis is also working on 
a piece of this deal and will be interested in your comments.

Thanks to each of you.  If you should need anything further, please do not 
hesitate to call me.
