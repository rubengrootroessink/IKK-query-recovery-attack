Tom, it appears that the ENA - IM Texas Desk is currently booking the 
Guadalupe Power Partners LP deal on a month to month basis only.  As such, it 
doesn't strictly meet the Material Contracts definition requiring that the 
deal be booked to flow more than 2,500 Mmbtu/d after 5/1/2001 or booked to 
flow more than 1,000 Mmbtu/d after 5/1/2002.  Is it still Enron's intent to 
deliver the Guadalupe Power Partners LP deal to AEP?  If so, I believe the 
contract pursuant to which the deal is done should continue to be included on 
the Mateiral Contracts list.

Patrick, I will assemble a list of ENA contracts that contributed to the 
financials that were presented in the data room.   This list will include any 
ENA contract that flowed between 5/1999 and 4/2000 and contributed to the 
HPLC financials.  If there are any ENA contracts that did not flow during 
that period, such as the Guadalupe Power Partners LP contract, it will be 
necessary to add them to the list of contracts to be moved from ENA to NEWCO 
if our intent is to include those contracts in Triple Lutz.

Jim, the Guadalupe Power Partners LP contract (96029942) was not included in 
the data room since, having no flow, it did not meet the minimum 3,000/d flow 
requirement to be included among contracts comprising the top 80% of the flow 
on HPLC.  Global Contracts indicates that the contract is dated 8/23/99, but 
has an operational effective date of 3/1/2001 with a primary term ending on 
3/31/2003.  Notes indicate that a daily flow of 80,000 Mmbtu is expected.  
The contract has not been scanned into the Global Contracts System.

Can we determine this?  I also forwarded a phone message to you from Brenda 
Herod on this.

Was there a deal with Guadalupe Power in the data room?  I have recently 
heard about the deal and Tom is concerned about it.  From what I can gather 
it is a Gas Daily priced deal (so I haven't marked it) so it hasn't shown up 
in my calculations.  I guess we just want to know that Duke/AEP where made 
aware of this contract.  Please let me know.

Dave
