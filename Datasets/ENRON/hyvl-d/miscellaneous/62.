  Really Bad Day

  There was this little guy sitting inside a bar, just looking at his
  drink. He didn't move for a half an hour.

  Then, this big trouble-making truck driver stepped up right next to him,
  took the drink from the guy, and just drank it all down.

  The poor man started crying.

  The truck driver said, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy
  you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man crying."

  "No, it's not that." the man said. "Today is the worst day of my life.
  First, I overslept and was late for an important meeting. My boss became
  outraged and then fired me.

  "When I left the building to go to my car, I found that it was stolen.
  The police said they could do nothing. I then got a cab to return home,
  and after I paid the cab driver and the cab had gone, I found that I left
  my wallet in the cab.

  "I got home only to find my wife was in bed with the gardener. I left
  home depressed and came to this bar. And now, when I was thinking about
  putting an end to my life...

  "... YOU show up and drink the poison."
