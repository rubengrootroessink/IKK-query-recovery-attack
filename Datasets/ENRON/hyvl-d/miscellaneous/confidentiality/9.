Debra & Dan -

I just spoke to Craig Breslau, who asked me to send the Master Physical email 
directly to the counterparty, with a copy to him.  So, would you please email 
the counterparty contacts, with copies to Craig and to me.

The counterparty contacts are:

Mr. David Lin
Formosa Plastics Corporation, U.S.A.
dlin@fpcusa.com


Mr. Larry Karl
Neumin Production Company
larrykarl@ftpc.fpcusa.com




Thanks again,

Jay
