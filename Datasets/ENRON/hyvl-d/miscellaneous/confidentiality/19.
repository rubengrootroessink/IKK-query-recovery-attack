Thanks for the help Dan.  I didn't know if Jeff was in today or not.  I will 
forward Jeff's version to you for reference purposes.   I think the best 
course of action is to mark up their form with the changes we would need and 
add whatever you think is necessary.  Then we'll just e-mail it back to them 
for comments.  It seems to me they are trying to drag their feet, so if we 
can push them a little that would be great.

George,
 I am not sure what language Jeff had proposed; however, I would note that 5 
years from disclosure is too long.  I would suggest that the period be 
shortened 3 years from the date of  the agreement or 2 years from 
disclosure.  The choice of law as New Jersey is also a problem, I would 
prefer Texas or New York.  Also, the correct name for ENA is Enron North 
America Corp.  Please let me know how you want to respond to their draft of 
the document.

Dan,
Can you compare this CA sent to us by PSE&G to the standard one Jeff had sent 
them?

Thanks,
George

Mr. McCormick,

As the request of Dave Wohlfarth, I am forwarding to you a proposed form of
confidentiality agreement to govern the exchange of  confidential
information in connection with a proposed transaction between PSE&G and
Enron.
