Dan, is Tammi Price someone at Enron or at Gibson?  I'm just looking to get a

Gibson's...

Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential 
Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is 
in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and 
forwarding to Gibson.
