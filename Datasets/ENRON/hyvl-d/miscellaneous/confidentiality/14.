Dan,

Attached below is the confidentiality agreement from Coral.  If you may 
recall, you mentioned the last time that it would be best to simply execute 
the document that we had already executed previously.  Give me a call once 
you have reviewed.

Thanks--Veronica

Subject: CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT


Attached is the file for the confidentiality agreement we discussed
yesterday.  This is the CA that was signed by Enron Capital & Trade
Resources Corp. signed back in 1997.  I did change the entity from ECTR to
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries and affiliates as you requested yesterday.
Please review and let me know if this is acceptable.  If so, please execute
2 documents, return them to me and I will have them executed by Coral.
After they have been fully executed, I will return one original to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
