   Thanks for the heads up.  You can e-mail a copy of the CA to me.  I will
   have legal review it and if ok, execute it.  Give me your fax number and
   I will fax you a copy of the executed CA and you can either e-mail, fax,
   or overnight the f/s.  Provide an address and I will send the hardcopy
   by overnight courier.  Thanks again for the heads up.

     Brant, TIL is an eligible swap participant. I will be pleased to have
     the
     financials forwarded to you. Please give me the full contact details
     (name
     - if not you, and full address details) to have a confidentiality
     agreement
     sent to you, to be duly signed. TIL's financials will be disclosed
     upon
     receipt of this confidentiality agreement duly signed by Enron.

     Also, are the deals under consideration LPG deals?

     Thanks for your reply.

     Noubi

        Thanks for the quick response.  The issue under consideration is
     one of
        eligibility.  The risk profile of existing trades is not a primary
        concern. Under US derivative law, customers must have $10MM total
     assets
        or $1MM shareholder equity or be guaranteed by such an entity or
     post
        cash/LCs in amounts reasonably approximating risk potential.
     Because
        ENA is a US registered company and its subsidiary, Enron Capital &
     Trade
        Resources International Corp. is a US registered company and both
        entities are trading derivatives with Total International, we must
        establish eligibility under one of the above criterion before
     trading
        any futher.  Again, credit risk of existing trades is not
     considered the
        issue.  Satisfaction of eligiblity criterion is the issue.  To this
        point, Total International has not guaranteed this entity and no
        financial statements have been provided. We must somehow work
     together
        to satisify these eligibility concerns.  Let me know what you
     think.  Or
        better yet, give me a call, 713-853-9897.

        thanks
        brant

          Further your e-mail, can you please indicate to me the details of
     the
          deals
          in consideration?
          I'll revert to you ASAP with the split of the trading activities
     vs.
          the
          main legal entities involved.

          Thank you for your co-operation.

          Noubi
