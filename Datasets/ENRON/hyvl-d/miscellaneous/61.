    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"
