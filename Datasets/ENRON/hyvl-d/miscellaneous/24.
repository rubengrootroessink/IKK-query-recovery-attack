> Two priests were going to Hawaii on vacation and decided that they would
> make this a real vacation by not wearing anything that would identify them
> as clergy.  As soon as the plane landed, they headed for a store and
> bought some really outrageous shorts and shirts, sandals, sunglasses,
> etc..
>
> The next morning, they went to the beach, dressed in their "tourist" garb
> and were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine, and the
> scenery, when a "drop dead" gorgeous blonde in a tiny bikini came walking
> straight toward them. They couldn't help but stare and when she passed
> them she turned to them, smiled and said, "Good morning father, good
> morning father" nodding and addressing each of them individually, then
> passed on by.
>
> They were both stunned - how in the world did she recognize them as
> priests?
>
> The next day they went back to the store, bought even more outrageous
> outfits - these were so loud, you could hear them before you even saw them
> - and again they settled on the beach in their chairs to enjoy the
> sunshine, etc..
>
> After a while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a string bikini this
> time, came walking toward them again.  (They were glad they had
> sunglasses, because their eyes were about to pop out of their heads).
>
> Again, she approached them and greeted them individually, "Good morning
> father, good morning father." and started to walk away.
>
> One of the priests couldn't stand it and said, "Just a minute young lady.
> Yes we are priests, and proud of it, but I have to know, how in the world
> did YOU know?"

> The woman replied, "Oh father, don't you recognize me? I'm Sister
