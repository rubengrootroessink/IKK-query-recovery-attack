Dan:

Could you print two of the attachment, get Phillip Allen to sign them and 
forward onto SoCalGas?  You can put my initials on the document.  I will 
leave Phillip a voice mail.  Once signed, please forward both to Angie 
Ishikawa.  You should probably call her to get the address.

Thanks, Jeff

Per your discussions with Mike Tierney, attached is the Master Netting 
Agreement (pdf file) in final form between our companies.? Based on my 
conversation with Mike, our companies have agreed to the following change: 
delete the definition of "Firm Transaction" in Paragraph 1.? Consequently, 
the references to "Firm Transaction" in Paragraph 3 (c) have been changed to 
"Transaction."

If this agreement meets with your approval, please have ENA's authorized 
representative sign two originals and mail to my attention for SoCalGas' 
completion ASAP.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (213) 244-3862. 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
