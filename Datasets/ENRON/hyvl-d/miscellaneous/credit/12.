Clement,

As a follow up to Veronica's e-mal to you a few days ago regarding the review 
of this guaranty, can you please let me know the status of your review.  
Please make note, the redline version attached below (enronredline112900.doc) 
was originally drafted by Dan and yourself as an attachment to an Enfolio 
Master agreement.  We are anxious to exchange guaranty's to cover exposure in 
this volatile price market.

Thank you,
Russell

Clement,

Attached below are Coastal's (formerly Engage Energy US) comments to our 
outgoing gty format.  The ISDA was recently amended due to Guarantor changes 
on their end, so now gty's are also being negotiated.  Please review their 
comments and forward either me or Russell your comments to forward on to 
Coastal.

Thanks again Clement,

Veronica

Veronica,
?
As  discussed, I am forwarding my recent email to Russell Diamond on the 
proposed  Enron Guaranty for our physical business.? The draft of the 
proposed  Guaranty from Coastal Corporation was approved, but Russell wanted 
me to send a  copy of that as well.? So, both the documents are  attached.
?
Please?let me know the status earliest  convenient.
?
Thanks!

?Russell,
?
Please find attached  a revised redline Guaranty which incorporates changes 
to Enron's standard  format.? In addition, we request??the following 
important  changes:
?
(1)???The proposed Guaranty?shouldcover all Obligations and not be  Contract 
specific.? Therefore the language in the second paragraph  beginning with the 
word 'WHEREAS' needs to be suitably amended by your Attorney  to reflect that 
all Obligations??of the  Obligors?are covered and?the 
Guaranty??obligations?are not tied to specific  contracts.
?
(2)? Under  Section 2, titled 'MAXIMUM LIMIT',?the Maximum Limit?should notbe 
capped for each entity at a  specific amount.Conversely, the limit on  
the?Guaranty?shouldbe a  'Unified Maximum'.??Please request your attorney to 
make suitable  language changes for this change as well.
?
Please send me a  revised redline earliest convenient for our review.
?
As requested  by you, I am resending the draft for the proposed Coastal 
Corporation Guaranty  that Dai Nguyen had?originally sent and on which you 
had indicated  acceptance(It is the second attachment from the  left).?
?
?Thanks??
