Dan--

This is the only form of netting that Credit provides counterparties.  I'm 
not sure whether Settlements could systematically net certain payments with a 
particular counterparty (and not net the other amouts owed pertaining to 
differing contracts).

Attached below is the generic ENA Netting document that we issue for your 
information.
