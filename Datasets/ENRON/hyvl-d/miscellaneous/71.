A young Marine and his commanding officer board a train headed through the
mountains of Switzerland. They can find no place to sit except for two
seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother.

After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young soldier
are interested in each other because they are giving each other "looks."

Soon, the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a
sound of the smack of a kiss, followed by the sound of the smack of a
slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without
saying a word.

The grandmother is thinking to herself: "It was very brash for that young
soldier to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."

The commanding officer is setting there thinking: "I didn't know the young
Marine was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't
missed him when she slapped and hit me!"

The young woman was sitting and thinking: "I'm glad the soldier kissed me,
but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"

The young Marine sat there with a satisfied smile on his face, thinking to
himself: "Life is good. When does a fellow have the chance to kiss a
beautiful girl and slap his commanding officer, all at the same time?"
