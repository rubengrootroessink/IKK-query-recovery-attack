A husband and wife  were having dinner at a very fine 
restaurant when this absolutely stunning  young woman came over to 
their table, gave the husband a big open-mouthed  kiss, said she'd see 
him later, and walked away. The wife glared at her  husband and said, 
"Who 
the hell ?was ?that?" 
"Oh," replied  the husband, "she's my mistress." 
"Well, that's the last straw," said the  wife. 
"I've had enough, and I want a divorce!" 
"I can understand that,"  replied her husband, "but 
remember, if we get a divorce it will mean no more  shopping 
trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados, no more summers in  
Tuscany, no more Infiniti or Lexus in the garage, and no more yacht  
club. But the decision is yours." 
Just then, a mutual friend entered the  restaurant with a 
gorgeous babe on his ?arm. 
"Who's that woman with  Jim?" asked the wife. 
"That's his mistress," said her husband. 
"Ours is  prettier," she replied.
