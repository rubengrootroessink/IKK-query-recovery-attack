George, Melissa has already gathered this info earlier. It may need to be 
update, but please check with her first. Thanks.

Subject: Gas contracts for the listed meters

George,

The meters listed below flow into a section of line in East Texas that feeds 
a paper mill.  The gas currently being produced is rich, if we lose the 
market the gas production will have to be processed.  Processing will cost 
HPL a minimum of $250k.  Here's the kicker, need this ASAP becase the market 
wants to pull the trigger by Friday.

Here are the questions by meter, (this is important because processing 
options are different for every meter:

1. who are the supply contracts with
2. can HPL terminate the contract for gas quality or did we waive the quality 
requirements
3. what is the status of each contract, when does it terminate, is it in 
evergreen, what are the notification procedures
4. what is the price on each contract
5. what did the wells produce in the latest available month
6. last but not least, do the contracts let us charge the producer for costs 
incurred to bring the production up to pipeline quality

4112
9650
6027
5189
6411

Jim, are these meters correct?

Are there any questions I did not address?
