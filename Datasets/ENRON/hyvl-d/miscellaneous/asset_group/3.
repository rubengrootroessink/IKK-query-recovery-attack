		 Subject: MUD 23 Access & Maintenance Agreement

Dan,

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan
so he can make these changes (I was only provided
hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

r
