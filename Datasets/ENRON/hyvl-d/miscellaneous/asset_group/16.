I have made some changes in the attached draft.  I do not think there should 
be another entry relative to the data room or divestiture, as it would 
certainly put a damper on the celebration.  Brian, I am sure that will be a 
topic of potential discussion, one that you need to be prepared to address.

Good Morning - As you're aware, we will be producing a  souvenir booklet on 
HPL for the anniversary party and I want to include another  entry under 2000 
that indicates the start of a new era since HPL has a data room  open.? I 
would appreciate your thoughts on how to word that.? Thanks,  Elaine
