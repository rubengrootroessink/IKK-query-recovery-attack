Dan,
Formosa has received the contract and asked to use "day of flow" Gas Daily 
rather than two day after for both excess and buy back gas.  Can you please 
make this change and I will resend?
Thanks,
Gary

I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary 
Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you 
know if they get executed.
