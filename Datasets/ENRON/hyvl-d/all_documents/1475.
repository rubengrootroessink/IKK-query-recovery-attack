Do you have a specific answer to the franchise question below?  I remember 
that it was an issue in the Baytown lawsuit, but did not hear the final 
aspect of that argument.  In light of the final decision, is that an issue 
today?  Please keep Candy in this loop, so that she can understand which 
options we might have.

I am familiar with the ultimate customer, NGO and know their buyer, as they 
are wholly owned sub of OxyChem.  They would be more than happy to discuss a 
direct connect to HPL. 

BUT, I recollect from a couple of years ago the possibility of franchise 
problems .... i.e. that our position was NOT to pursue a direct connect to 
NGO as this might place HPL in a position of exposure with respect to the 
franchise tax to the City of Baytown.

Steve - comments??

We discussed this project in our staff meeting today.  I will be talking to 
Lee and getting his thoughts on the matter.  Early on, it was mentioned that 
we should make an effort to serve this customer directly without Entex 
involvement.  Exxon advised that we would need to move our line by Sept. 2001 
+/-.

Will do, not much new happening.  I have notified Entex that HPL is not 
replacing the line, Danny says that the project is beginning to move a 
little.  I'll touch base with him again.

Steve advised me in our staff meeting today that you and Danny Cosby are 
working together on  the subject topic at Baytown concerning an Exxon and 
Entex involvement.

Please tell me where you are on this and include me in your work on this 
project as Steve has requested such.

Thanks, guys!


Candy
