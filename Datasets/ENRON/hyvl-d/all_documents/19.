I would like to visit with you next week regarding the final structure (e.g., 
the put details) agreed. Please set up some time on my calendar. Thanks for 
your help.

Alan, Doug signed the fuel agreements for Nicaragua last friday.  We are 
waiting for Glencore to sign the contracts, at which time all of the 
documents will have been signed and delivered.  EI has agreed to indemnify 
EFI and reimburse any out of pocket costs should EI elect to take EFI out of 
the fuel arrangement.  EFI has a put to the project and Glencore if Enron 
elects to get out of the project.
