Debra & Dan -

Attached is a worksheet for a new Master Firm Purchase/Sale agreement, with 
Public Utility District No. 1 of Clark County.

Dave Fuller in the Portland office is working on a long-term gas supply deal 
with this counterparty, with a total value of $500 million.  We need to get a 
draft agreement to him ASAP.  Please make every effort to get this out at the 
absolute early possible opportunity!!!

Sorry for the rush, but thanks in advance for your assistance,


Jay
