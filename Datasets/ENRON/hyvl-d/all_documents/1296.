> "I'll have a beer, too," says the ostrich.

> The bartender pours the beer and says, "That will be $3.40 please," and
> the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out exact change for payment.
>
> The next day, the man and the ostrich come again, and both order a beer.
> Once again, the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact

> again and the bartender asks, "The usual?"
>
> "Well, it's close to last call, so I'll have a large scotch," says the
> man.
>
> "Same for me," says the ostrich.
>
> "That will be $7.20," says the bartender. Once again, the man pulls exact

>
> Well," says the man, "several years ago I was cleaning the attic, and I
> found an old lamp.  When I rubbed it, a genie appeared and offered me
> two wishes.  My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I
> just put my hand in my pocket, and the right amount of money will
> always be there."
>
> "That's brilliant!" says the bartender.  "Most people would wish for a
> million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want
> for as long as you live!
>
> "That's right!  Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the
> exact money is always there," says the man.
>
> The bartender asks, "One other thing, sir; what's with the ostrich?"
>
> The man replies, "My second wish was for a chick with long legs."
