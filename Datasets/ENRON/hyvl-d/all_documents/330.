Hi Kiran,

Russell, 

This is regarding our agreement to do a reciprocal US$ 25 million guaranty to 
cover Engage US only for PHYSICAL transactions.? Please let me know which are 
the Enron entities that need to be included in the Guaranty.? As soon as I 
have that information, I will forward the request to our Treasury, who will 
then arrange for internal approvals and then send you a draft guaranty for 
approval.

Thanks, 
Kiran Parthasarathy
