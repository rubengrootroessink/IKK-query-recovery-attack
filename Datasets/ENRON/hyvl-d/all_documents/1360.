Don't know if this is true but it's still funny!

alone

>  Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the
barrel

in

seemed

bricks

> however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I

> lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.
> This explains the two broken legs.
