Re; 0:/Legal?DHYVL/DJH/2001/Ltr/2001-005crfm.doc
I just did a deal with Panther and I would use the same contract with this 
additional language.

Period of Delivery: April 01, 2001 - March 31, 2002


add that either party can terminate with 30 days written notice
add evergreen language so the deal will roll after the one year term.


Thanks,
J


Is the commodity price at Katy tail gate or HSC?  It looks like the contract 
says both?
