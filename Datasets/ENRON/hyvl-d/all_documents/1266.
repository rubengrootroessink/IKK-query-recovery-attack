They want to do another transaction through March 02. Credit is not willing 
to enter into this transaction unless we have an executed Master Physical 
Agreement that gives us collateral rights.

darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?
