Dan,

We have a customer - True Oil Company - that would like us to gather and buy 
their gas in the Powder River.
They do not want a gathering agreement. They only want a purchase agreement. 
They are willing to commit that the reserves will flow through Enron's 
facilities but do not want to sign a gathering agreement.
We do not want to purchase their gas for an agreed to rate for more than one 
year.
We want the reopener in the purchase agreement.
Their idea is that we would purchase the gas at CIG index minus $0._____ and 
if Enron is not purchasing the gas that a third party will have to 
pay/negotiate with Enron for the gathering.

The minus would include all gathering - field and Ft Union, fuel, shrink, 
margin, etc.

Do you have any thoughts on this??

Mike

Also, on the Appendix 1 of the purchase agreement - Force Majeure - I think 
we can take out the last line that talks about Y2K related problems.
On Exhibit D for Scott Sitter's address, the street number should come before 
Denver, Co - I know I did this!!!
