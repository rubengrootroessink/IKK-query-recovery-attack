Subject: Electronic Version of Final Gas Purchase Agreement



     Attached is an electronic version of the final Gas Purchase Agreement
     between ECT and FPL.  As I explained to Ozzie, this version is for
     your own internal purposes only.  Due to past experience with
     different printers causing a difference in pagination in the document,
     this electronic version should not be printed out and used as a
     version of the Agreement.  Two copies of the "official" document are
     being sent to you via express mail and should arrive before 12:00 noon
     today.  This "official" document is the document that will be executed
     and should be distributed as the final agreement.  Nevertheless, I
     thought it might be helpful for you to also have the agreement in an
     electronic format.

     Please call if you have any questions.  We look forward to closing the
     deal, as, I expect, do you!

     Thanks.

     Debra
