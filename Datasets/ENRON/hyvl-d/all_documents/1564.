This letter and agreement were required to be executed as a condition 
precedent to closing due to the failure to have the consent at the time of 
closing.....it cost us at least $500,000; this should not have occurred.  
Dan, please have a draft of the agreement which comports with this 
agreement....and not the back-to-back previously drafted  ready for my review 
by Friday.  I will circulate it to AEP, on Monday or Tuesday.....if you have 
questions, see me.

Sincerely
bng,
