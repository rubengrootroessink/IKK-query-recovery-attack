?Sounds great to me. Are you bringing the fixins for the  burgers? Or do you 
want me to get that? I thought Bettye And I could provide  beans and potato 
salad and any desserts. I'm bringing a dewberry pie and another  dessert. I 
think Mom is planning on fixing chicken noodle soup' Buddy saw Mom  today, 
says she was doing real well today. I think maybe working that election  
Saturday was a bit of a strain on her and thats why she seemed so confused  
Tuesday. See you'll Sunday
