Maybe this is what you were asking me about earlier.  Melissa may have all 
the answers already.

Subject: Canadian Counterparties Needing Master Agreements

Per Bob Bowen's earlier request, attached, please find a listing of the 
Canadian Counterparties that currently do not have a Master Agreement in 
place.  I have noted which type of Master(s) would be appropriate based on 
the type of business currently being done on the Ontario desk with each 
Counterparty. 

 Geoff, I would be glad to meet and review this listing with you to make sure 
I have captured the correct information regarding the type of business you 
are conducting with each of these counterparties, just let me know when you 
are available.  




Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,
