Thank you for making these changes so quickly.  I failed to ask you to
include one other item in the Transaction Agreement.  I would like to you to
specify that Rhodia does have trigger rights and that there are no minimum
volumes required to trigger.  Once you add that info and email the revised
Transaction Agreement back to my attention, I will be able to forward to
Rhodia.  Thank you for your assistance.  Once again, I apologize for
overlooking this item when we talked yesterday.

Susan
