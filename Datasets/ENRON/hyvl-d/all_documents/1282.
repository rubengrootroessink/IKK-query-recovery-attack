Travis:

Pursuant to Posting Agreement Exhibit I, section 4, attached please find a
table that compares HSE's short product descriptions with EOL's short
product descriptions.  Also included is a screen shot of the HSE gas
platform.  We would like to review these with you in advance of our final
acceptance testing so we will have adequate time to make any changes you may
request.  Please note also that we will be posting long descriptions on our
Website, based on Enron's long descriptions.  We will submit these to you by
Thursday.

Please feel free to call me with any questions.

Regards,
John
