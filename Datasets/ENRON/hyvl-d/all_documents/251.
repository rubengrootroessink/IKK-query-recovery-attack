To all:

I am out the week of the 4th of July, although if you need any information 
for the letter to Cage, the file is on my desk (an orange file labeled 'Cage 
Gas').

Thanks

Russell

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell
