Subject: Export of Gas From Alberta

If ECTR is buying gas in Alberta you should be aware that that the Alberta 
Energy Utilities Board has permitting and reporting requirements for gas 
produced in and exported from Alberta.   

The AEUB is quite flexible on who has to hold the permit and report the 
exports.  Either the buyer or seller can hold the permit and do the 
reporting.  At the present time ECTR does not hold an AEUB Blanket Export 
Permit (ECT Canada does but obviously ECTR volumes cannot be reported under 
the ECT Canada permit).  Therefore if ECTR is buying Alberta gas then it 
needs to do one of two things: (a) agree with its counterparty that it will 
report the exports under its AEUB permit, or (b) instruct me to get a blanket 
permit in the name of ECTR (and then have Juanita Marchand in Houston do the 
reporting for ECTR under this permit).

Please let me know if this is an issue that requires my attention.

Subject: Import of Canadian Gas into the U.S.

I was recently contacted by Juanita Marchand who does all the reporting of 
Canadian exports under ECTR's NEB Export Licences and U.S. DoE Import 
Authorizations out of Houston.   You guys need to advise Juanita of all of 
the points at which you are importing Canadian gas into the U.S. so she can 
ensure ECTR's total export/import volumes are correct.  She will call you to 
get this info from you.

Also, Juanita is reporting all the volumes you export/import under ECTR's NEB 
Short Term Blanket Permit GO-75-98 and its U.S. DoE Blanket Authorization 
1323.  If you enter into any term deals that are longer than two years you 
should advise me of this so we can consider whether the deal should be 
supported by its own NEB and U.S. DoE permit.

Thanks.

Rob
