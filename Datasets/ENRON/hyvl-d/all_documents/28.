Barbara,
 This relates to our meeting last Thursday when I asked Brenda if the Entex 
Gas Marketing transactions stayed with Janet Wallis.  It is my understanding 
that the Entex traders for both Entex and Entex Gas Marketing are sometimes 
the same.  I recall times when Janet would request a deal under Entex and 
then Entex would move the  transaction to Entex Gas Marketing.  They have 
also gone the other way on some deals.  
 The same is possible with Southern Union Gas Company and Mercado in 
Galveston and Port Arthur.  
 I raised the question because these may occur at or behind the city gate 
delivery point.
Brenda said that she was going to ask the business group how they wanted to 
handle Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado.
