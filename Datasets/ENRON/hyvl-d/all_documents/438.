Could one of you please call Amy Baird to talk to resolve Items #3 and #4 in 
her memo.  They have agreed to our changes on #1&#2.  Mike Cesario at Ormet 
told me to drop #5.  They did agree to limit total consequential damages to 
$1,000,000 for the contract.  They would like for the language in 8.3 to 
limit their damages to actual replacement costs (transport, hedges, 
re-marketing the gas)  since we can't really incur consequential damages.  

Thanks
Craig
