Dan, Is Entex Gas Marketing correct?  Ducote said to refer to the GISBY 
contracts for the proper name (which you may have done).

Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle
