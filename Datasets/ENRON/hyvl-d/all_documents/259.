Doug Leach advised that he spoke with Sergio at Glencore yesterday, and 
Glencore is satisfied with the June 5 draft (copy attached) of the FSA, with 
the exception of 2 matters:
1.  He wants the LIBOR rate on late payments in Section 9.3 to be fixed on a 
specific day (e.g., the due date for the payment)
2.  He wants the ENE payment guarantee referenced in Section 9.5 to be 
increased to $7MM due to increased fuel prices.  
Doug is running these two points by Tom Moran on Monday, but doesn't believe 
they will be a problem (with respect to ENE furnishing the guarantee).

I intend to courier execution copies of the FSA to Glencore on Monday, after 
we get the confirmation from Tom Moran, unless any of you notify me of a 
problem with 
these changes.  
Regards,
Diana
