Alan,

Good morning.  I thought we had a productive day yesterday and we enjoyed 
working with you, Norrie and Donna.

Once Donna has completed her comments to our discussion yesterday, please 
forward to Les, Dan and myself.  I will be in a derivatives class today but 
call me on my cell (713-443-4652) once you have sent the revised document 
over.

Thanks.
