Attached is a copy of Ormet's mark-up to the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement 
post V.P. of Finance review.  The changes are primarily to Exhibit D.  
Additionally, there is one chage under Suspension of Performance on Appendix 
1 page "1"-3.  Finally, we need to address the collateral 
requirment/termination payment threshhold in section 4.3.
Thanks,
Mike
