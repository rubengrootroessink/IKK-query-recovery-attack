Paul:

The reviewed and redlined version of your contract is attached below.  I
spoke with Stacy Dickson/Enron North America this a.m. prior to reviewing
your agreement.  Stacy and I are presently negotiating the Enfolio
agreement and I believe that we are near completion.

I have submitted essentially the same edits to your contract that were
suggested by our Legal/Credit Departments for the Enron Enfolio.  Please
review these changes and call me with any questions or concerns.  Stacy
Dickson was kind enough to offer her assistance as well.

You may reach me at (713)207-3266 with any questions or concerns.  I look
forward to hearing from you.
