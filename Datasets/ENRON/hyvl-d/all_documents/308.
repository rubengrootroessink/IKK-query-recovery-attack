		 Subject: Entex Contracts.  FYI

Through the efforts of Jim Ducote, Bruce Coogler and George Hepburn at 
Reliant Energy Entex have agreed to waive the confidentiality provisions of 
the 3 major purchase/sale contracts that Enron North America Corp has with 
Reliant Energy Entex and Unit Gas Transmission Company and thereby permit 
such contracts to be included in the data room without redacting.  George 
Hepburn indicated that he would sign the waiver tonight and get the signature 
of another officer and fax the waiver back to us tomorrow morning.  I will 
let you know when we receive the fax.
