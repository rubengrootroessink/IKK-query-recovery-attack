Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another 
contract under HPLC and assign that one.
What do you think?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River 
Sation) to refect a swap from index to fixed price.

5,000 a day 
$6.28 + .199 instead of Index + .199

After months of email negotiations, the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and The City of San Antonio, 
action through the City Public Service Board has been signed.  Just in time 
to assign to the new entity being set up for the non HPL Texas deals that 
need to remain separate from HPL.
