Dan--

Please check the attachments; I believe you may have inadvertently attached 
Petrogulf redlines instead of Yates...Thanks!

Dan,
 Please review the attached and call me if you feel that we should 
incorporate some of the other items which Yates requested in the next draft.  
I have enclosed a red-lined version showing changes and a clean copy of each 
agreement.
