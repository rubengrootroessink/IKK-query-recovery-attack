Thank you for your participation in our first two pilots.  Your effort, time 
spent, feedback, and interest in the program has been very helpful in 
improving it.  Thank you, too, for your patience through this new process.  

We are excited to announce the beginning of Internet Service Ordering today, 
Wednesday, January 10.  Many of our vendors are ready to begin providing

ClickAtHome Internet Service Providers whom are currently available for 
internet service are

MSN will be available in late February, providing both dial-up and DSL
