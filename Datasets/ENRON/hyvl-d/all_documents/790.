Dan & Debra -

Attached is a worksheet for a new Master Firm Purchase/Sale with Cross 
Timbers Oil Company.  We currently have a Master Physical with this 
counterparty, but I want to revise this agreement to reflect the attached 
terms.

Please prepare and send out to Mr. Louis Baldwin at Cross Timbers at your 
earliest convenience.



Thanks,

Jay
