Dan,  here is the latest term sheet.  Not included is the storage and 
language regarding agency agreement regarding transport.  Please update the 
enfolio contract, attach storage contract language and suggest agency 
language.  Thanks for your help.  I'm looking to get this to Joe today.

Regars,
Ozzie
