John,

Our situation in Nicaragua is that we are on hold pending authorization from 
the government to start commissioning.  This is currently a delicate subject 
and I do not want to receive fuel until we have started commissioning.

We have approx 15 days of fuel onboard to support commissioning, so I can 
afford to postpone fuel delivery about two weeks after we start commissioning.

Therefore, what I am requesting is that EFI/Glencore allow me to provide a 10 
day notice for the first fuel delivery to Nicaragua.  Physically we are ready 
in that all the tanks, pipes hoses, etc... are in place.  This is a 
commercial issue right now.

Please advise if a 10 day notice will be acceptable to EFI/Glencore.

Regards,

Tito
