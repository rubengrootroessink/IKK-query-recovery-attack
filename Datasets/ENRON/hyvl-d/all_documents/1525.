Hi Dan,

I just got a call on a contract you routed to me at my old location.  About 
three weeks ago, my group moved to the 21st floor.  Please send all 
purchase/sale agreements to me at EB2127B and any processing/service 
agreements to Sylvia Campos at EB2127A.  Sorry if I neglected to inform you 
earlier.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
