Dan / Shonnie:

Please review the attached turn of the Coleman documents.  As you will see, 
their attorney (Howard Hartzburg of Jones & Keller in Denver) made numerous 
stylistic changes and some substantive changes.

I have discussed a few of the substantive changes with Coleman and told them 
that, at this late stage, stylistic changes will slow us down.  Of course, 
they responded that their changes "just helped the contract to be easier to 
read".

Let me know your thoughts. 

Thanks.

Dan
