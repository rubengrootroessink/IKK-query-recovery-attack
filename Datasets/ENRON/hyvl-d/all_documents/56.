Dan -- Would you review the pricing changes in the attached doc.  Do you have

David,
 As we discussed, the Note provision of the Contract Price section of the 
confirm should be deleted.  Since the $3MM is to be paid for all events 
except for a default by SMC under this confirm or under the confirm for 
theexisting FPL base load, it would make the document clearer to restate the 
commodity price without the $0.0126 per MMBtu consideration and add a demand 
charge provision to cover the payment of such $0.0126 per MMBtu times the DCQ 
times the days in the month, excluding any default by Seller regarding the 
sale of volumes destined for delivery to FPL.
