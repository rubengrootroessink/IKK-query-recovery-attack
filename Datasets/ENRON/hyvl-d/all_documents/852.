I talked to Stacey Dempsey today.  We are going to do this.  I had lunch with 
Jeff today.  I am not coming back until March 1.  (Actually I have to work 
one day in February to get my bonus-if I get one-and to get my 2001 vacation.

MSN DSL Service

The ClickAtHome program will be launching DSL service through MSN in mid 
February.  We are looking to identify a group of volunteers who are 
interested in helping us test the MSN installation processes prior to that 
launch.  

What's involved?
Participants will be asked to order MSN DSL service through the regular MSN 
retail  website or call center.  We will ask for your feedback on MSN's 
performance during and after the installation process.  As MSN requires a 
1-year contract (through both the standard retail process AND the ClickAtHome 
plan), participants will continue their service with retail MSN for the 
period of this contract.  Participants will receive their ClickAtHome program 
subsidy through a monthly reimbursemet process which will require the 
completion and submission of a reimbursement form.

Why do you want to participate?
You can order your DSL service now!
You will receive your ClickAtHome DSL subsidy
We will convert your account to the ClickAtHome plan after your 12 month 
period has expired
To Help out ClickAtHome Team 

What is the downside of participating?
Your order will not be placed through the ClickAtHome website, but rather 
through the standard MSN site
You will be required to pay the full monthly bill and apply for a 
reimbursement each month
You will be in a 12 month contract with MSN (the standard Enron plan will 
also require a 12 month contract)

Interested?
If you are interested in volunteering, please send your response to 
clickathomepilot1@enron.com for further information.  Thank you from the 
ClickAtHome team!
