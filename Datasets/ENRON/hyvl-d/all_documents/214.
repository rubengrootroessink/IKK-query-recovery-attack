Dan,

Here is the scope of the deal with Citizens Utilities, there are a couple of 
things we will have to mention in the contract that are not addressed in this 
letter:
1)  That all load balancing will be handled by injection and withdrawal from 
storage, and that these incremental costs (i.e. variable charges) will be 
paid 
      by Citizens.
2.)  I need to work out a predetermined load profile with Citizens, and that 
profile will need to be in the contract.  This load profile will be used as a 
guide
       and the contract language will need to be able to accommodate 
nomination changes on a daily basis, at our discretion.

I'm sure you will need further explanation, so feel to call me.  Thanks again 
for all you help.

Paul
