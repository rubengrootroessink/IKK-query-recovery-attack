Dan,

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell
