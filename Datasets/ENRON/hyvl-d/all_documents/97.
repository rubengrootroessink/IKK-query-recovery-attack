Rolando-  At last !   
As promised, enclosed please find a revised Delivered Gas Supply Proposal 
which incorporates the value of Lakeland's ability to switch among alternate 
fuels. Once you review the enclosed, let me know when you can set aside time 
for David and I to meet with you and and walk through the proposal in detail.
