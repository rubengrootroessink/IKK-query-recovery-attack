Dan,

The agreement you sent me was not the final agreement signed by Westport. The 
one they signed - see attached - was a Field Services agreement, not a 
Gathering Services agreement.

I made the changes to the attached in Section 4.1. 
Let me know if you are ok with them.

Do we need to have the whole agreement signed or can the one page just be 
changed ?

Mike
