Debra & Dan -

Urgent Request!!!   


Please prepare an EXECUTABLE COPY and forward to Craig Breslau for further 
handling to the counterparty.  I need to get this done ASAP!!!  We have a 
very large physical transaction pending this, and I need to get this in front 
of the counterparty immediately.



Thanks,

Jay
