>>> This little boy wakes up 3 nights in a row when he hears a thumping
>>>sound coming from his parents bedroom.  Finally one morning he goes to
>>>his mom and says, "Mommy, every night I hear you and daddy making noise
>>>and when I look in you're bouncing up and down on him".
>>>
>>> His mom is taken by surprise and says. "Oh... well I'm bouncing on his
>>>stomach because he's fat and that makes him thin again."
>>>
>>>And the boy says, "That won't work."
>>>
>>> His mom says, "Why?".
>>>
>>> The boy replies, "Because the lady next door comes by after you leave
>>>each day and blows him back up!"
