Alabama Electric confirmed on Monday, 1/4/00, that they will not trigger 
their termination right under our recent Agreement.  

Pursuant to our executed transaction with AEC dated 9/22/99, AEC had the 
right to terminate the Agreement by providing ENA with notice by 12/31/99, if 
AEC had not received environmental clearance from the Rural Utility Services. 

AEC has indicated that while they have not received final clearances from the 
RUS, they are comfortable going at risk under the ENA Agreement.  The 
Agreement is self-implementing in that AEC elected to not give notice.

AEC expects to have their final clearance by mid January.

This transaction can now be booked as a 1Q00 transaction


Thanks to everyone for assistance on this transaction
