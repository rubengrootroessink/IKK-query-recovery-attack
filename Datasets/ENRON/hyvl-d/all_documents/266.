Jeff,

I have been working closely with Southern Company on the sale of natural gas 
from Elba and/or Destin for 10 yrs.  Please note the attached Exhibits that 
Southern has drafted to our Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement dated December 
29, 1999.  Additionally, I have attached two proposals that summarizes the 
structure of the deal.  Pricing is still to be determined once we agree upon 
the language for your review.  Please advise as to a time that we may 
discuss.  I can be reached at x37912.



Thanks.

Phil D.

 Phil,

Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am frowarding to you a revised draft
of the confirmation letters covering the two LNG transactions SCS is
discussing with you.  In the interests of time, they have not been reviewed
by Alan or the other SCS folks and so are subject to any comments or changes
they might have.
