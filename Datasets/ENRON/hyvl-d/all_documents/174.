Dan

I know you are going to communicate with Coleman's attorney to answer his 
(hopefully) final concerns.  I have attached the gathering services primarily 
to remind you of the remaining change requested by Jim Anderson, my 
counterpart at Coleman.

However, I do have one last item to discuss with you that I hope we can 
handle just in the definitions section, so after your contact with Coleman's 
attorney, give me a ring.

THX
