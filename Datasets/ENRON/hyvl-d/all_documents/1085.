Julie,

Attached is a list of 89 HPL Resources Company contracts that were active in 
the Global Contracts database on 3/17/2001.  Please determine:

1.  Which contracts will be needed to continue business after the expected 
6/1/2001 sale of HPL to AEP.  

2.  Which contracts are no longer used and can be terminated immediately.

3.  Which contracts will be needed to conduct intercompany business until 
5/31/2001, but will no longer be needed after the expected 6/1/2001 sale of 
HPL to AEP.

If appropriate, we should attempt to have as many of the type 2 contracts (no 
longer used) terminated at the end of this month on 3/31/2001.
