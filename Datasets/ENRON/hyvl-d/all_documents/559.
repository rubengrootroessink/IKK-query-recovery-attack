Pilot 2 Participants!

Thanks again for participating in ClickAtHome's Pilot study.  We are very 
anxious to get started and are so excited to bring this incredible benefit to 
you!  We promised we would follow up this week, so here we are...  

Based on feedback we have received from Pilot 1, we are taking additional 
time to further integrate with our vendor websites and are expanding the 
vendor offerings to bring broadband coverage to more employees.  We 
anticipate ordering to begin in late December.  Please feel free to email us 
at clickathomepilot2@enron.com if you have any questions.  

Thanks again,
The ClickAtHome Project Team!
