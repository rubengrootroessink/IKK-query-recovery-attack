Barbara,
I spoke, through a few voicemail messages, with Robert Rose earlier today
regarding the status of the easement we discussed a few weeks ago.  He
informed me that he turned in a draft to you and Ann Elizabeth a week or so
ago and had yet to hear back from either of you.  I was hoping to be able to
give a progress report to the engineer and developer working on the project
by Wednesday of next week (ideally with some progress to actually report),
so if it is at all possible to let me know, or have Robert let me know,
where everything stands, I would appreciate hearing from you.
Thanks,
Erin

Barbara,
I am following up on our conversation last week in which you asked me to
contact you if I hadn't heard back from you by today.  Please let me know
if
you are having any success in finding the right person to talk to regarding
the easement we previously discussed.  Thanks again for your time and
effort.
Best Regards,
Erin
