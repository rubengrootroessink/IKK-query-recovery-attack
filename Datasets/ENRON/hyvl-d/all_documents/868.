TODAY'S JOKE
ABSOLUTELY SWEET MARIE
submitted by Tim Breth 

Billy Bob and Lester were   talking one afternoon when Billy Bob tells 
Lester, "Ya know, I reckon I'm about ready for a vacation. Only this year I'm 
gonna do it a little different.  The last few years, I took your suggestions 
as to where to go.  Three years ago you said to go to Hawaii. I went to 
Hawaii and Marie got pregnant.  Then two years ago, you told me to go to the
Bahamas, and Marie got pregnant again.  Last year you suggested Tahiti and 
darned if Marie didn't get pregnant
again."

Lester asks Billy Bob, "So, what you gonna do this year that's
different?"

Billy Bob says, "This year I'm taking Marie with me."
