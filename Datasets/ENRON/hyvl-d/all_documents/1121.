Debra, Dan, and Ellen -

Deal QZ2383.1, with Weirton Steel Corporation, is approved by Credit, subject 
to the inclusion in the confirm of specific credit provisions.

Debra:  This is the deal that we discussed late last week, where you had 
worked up an ENFOLIO FIRM CONFIRMATION (attached below) with the credit terms 
that I had provided.  Jennifer Shipos informs me that the estimated price per 
Mmbtu is $6.13 for inclusion in the commercial terms section of the ENFOLIO 
confirmation (actual pricing is NYMEX plus $0.31 basis).

Ellen:  Please send out the confirm ONLY upon receipt of the ENFOLIO 
documents from Debra.  The documents below are simply drafts, and can not be 
sent with the confirm.  It is imperative that the credit provisions are 
included in this confirmation.  Once you have received these from Debra, 
please send out confirm at your earliest convenience.

IF ANYONE SHOULD HAVE ANY QUESTONS ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION, PLEASE CALL ME AT 
EXTENSION 53923.


Thanks,

Jay
