GSC manages the entire RFP process for its clients.  We maintain files for
each prospective/actual supplier, including many items that the clients
themselves do not have.  As we have the most comprehensive files relating to
each supplier in the RFP process, our clients have asked that we also have
an original executed contract and original executed guaranty to complete the
file.

Therefore, please route all three copies of the documents for review and
execution.

I will check with you on Tuesday on the status of Enron's review.

Have a nice weekend.
Kim

Kim,
     I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of
comparing the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.
Once I finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to
Enron Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will
let you know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the
deal contact for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know
when it has been signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be.
     If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart
execution which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by
WPSC.
     Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A
copy should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

Dan-

Please confirm that you have received the executable copies of the
Wisconsin
Public Service contracts and Enron Corp guarantees.

Also, could you please give me an estimated date that Enron will mail the
partially executed contracts and executed guarantees to WPSC?  We would
appreciate them being sent by overnight mail.

Thanks,
Kim
