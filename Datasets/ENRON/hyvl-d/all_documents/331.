Why can't we assign the existing Master with Chevron Chemical Company LLC to 
the new entity??

Please see Veronica's response below, the Credit information has been 
fowarded to Dan in legal for preparation of the Master.

Yes that is correct.  When I spoke to the counterparty he mentioned wanting 
to be looked as their own Company.  Which is fine, since the entity is 
rated.  What these companies are doing is simply combining their 
petrochemical assests to become the largest company in that industry.  I 
tried telling Dan Hyvl that, but he didn't understand my viewpoint.  Yes 
their name is listed as an LP, but I really can't explain as to why it is.  I 
just told Dan to call them to get the entire Legal run-down from them.  We do 
need to execute a new Master though.

Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.
