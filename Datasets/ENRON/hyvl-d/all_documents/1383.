Art, 

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I 
have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the 
actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the 
Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price 
at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,

Kim
