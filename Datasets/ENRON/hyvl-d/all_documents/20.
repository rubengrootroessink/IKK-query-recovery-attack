Gary, Is this the Master Agreement under which Janet Wallis sent notice to 
Mercado that notwithstanding the stated Period of Delivery thereunder, all 
existing Transaction Agreements would expire effective September 30, 1998?  
If so, which Transaction Agreements do you wish to redo for the period May 1, 
1999 thru April 30, 2000.
