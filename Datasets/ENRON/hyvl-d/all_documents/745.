Below is the revised version of the Crude Oil Agreement, with changes from
the one you probably saw this morning.  Alan Aronowitz thought (and I
concur) that since we don't really have liquidated damages we should take
that language out of the last section.

I'll send the proposed Gas Agreement, marked from the Oil one, shortly.

Attached is a revised document showing changes received from Teresa Bushman
and Joan Quick, as well as a special termination agreement agreed to with
the Banks in a conference call yesterday.  At Nora's instruction I am
sending a clean version of this document to the Banks and their counsel.
