Dan,

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks, 

Kim

Kim-

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.

Calvin,

     Attached is a draft copy of our Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement.
Please let me know what I can do to help facilitate the process required to
get this in place.

Thanks,

Kim
