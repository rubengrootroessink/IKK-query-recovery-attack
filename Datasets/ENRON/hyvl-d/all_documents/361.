Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

  This draft has not been sent due to pending guaranty issues.  The attached

( per your change) and are specific to this agreement.  Dan has advised the 
guaranties are written for the agreement and we cannot change to include 
other Enron Companies.  You will need to contact  Enron Corp. for a guaranty 
to included other companies.

Please let me know how you wish to proceed.  Finally, the contact on your 
worksheet is Faye Carlin (713) 877-7133
