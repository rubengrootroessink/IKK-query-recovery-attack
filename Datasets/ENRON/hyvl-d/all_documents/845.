Subject: Crestar - alliance AOS deal - operational guidelines


We have attempted to operationalize the Alliance - AOS contract between
Enron North America and Crestar (now Keyspan) as follows:


8:00 am - Alliance announce the % of AOS that will flow the next gas day
(weekend)

9:00 am - Crestar (Keyspan) determines economic viability and informs Enron
, by phone, of AOS volumes to Enron's central cash desk

(Patrice Thurston)
          *** The deal will be 'done' at this time as per the AOS contract.

          (Note --  Crestar is in the process of assigning a portion the
AOS contract to BP.  After this assignment has been approved by Enron,
               BP and Crestar will notify Enron of daily AOS volumes)

9:45 am - Enron informs Crestar (Keyspan)   { and BP after contract
assignment}  the contract numbers, volumes, pipelines, and other required
     nominations information
     - Crestar (Keyspan) {and BP after contract assignment}  will nominate
on Alliance to ENA

10:30  - Nominations deadline (1st cycle)

12:00 - Pipelines will (should) confirm all nominations

(all times are MST)
