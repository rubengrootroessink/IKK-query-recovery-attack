I have again reviewed the master listing which Melissa prepared last Thursday 
and compared the names thereon to the RRC listing of Investor Owned Companies 
Filing Annual Reports for calendar year 1997.  Based thereon, the following 
companies should be excluded from the gas sales agreements being transferred 
to HPL:

City of Brazoria
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Empire Pipeline Corp.
Entex, a Division of NorAm Energy Corp.
Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Lone Star Gas Company
Markham Gas Corp.
Oasis Pipe Line Company
Petrofina Gas Pipeline Company
Reliant Energy - Entex
Southern Union Company  ---- This should be "Southern  Union Gas Company, a 
division of               Southern Union Company"
Southern Union Gas Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Additionally, we need to verify that Global Contract # 96003955 is not 
"Western Gas Resources-Texas, Inc."  If it is, it should also be excluded.

Also excluded is the Central Desk deal with "Central Illinois Light Company".

Have we determined if the agreements with "Entex Gas Marketing Company" and 
"Mercado Gas Services, Inc." are staying or going?
