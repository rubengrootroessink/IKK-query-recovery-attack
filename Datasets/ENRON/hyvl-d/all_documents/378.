That is not right, even if it is A-, we still need credit langauge.  We do 
not need credit language if we are putting in a Master Sales Agreement.  I 
thought Stacy used the Master Firm Sales contract.

I will send up a credit worksheet for this counterparty.

We need to do a master purchase sale agreement because we would be buying  
back any quantities they obligated themselves to buy but failed to buy.  I 
did not know that we still used the single purpose sale agreement or that we 
had an approved form for such.  Do I understand you that since they are A- 
rated we need no credit language in the master and no triggering events.  
Please  confirm!!!!!

We are only selling gas to them, the credit is rated A- by S&P, do you need a 
Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement, or just a Master Firm Sale Agreement.  
Let me know if you still need a credit worksheet.

Russell,
 Have you prepared a credit sheet for this?  If not, when?
