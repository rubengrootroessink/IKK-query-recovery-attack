Attached is the revised confirmation.  The changes made were to the Maximum 
Daily Purchase Quantity, the Transportation Capacity Credit, and the 
Transportation Capacity Release, as well as a few minor clean ups for 
consistency.  Please provide any additional comments needed and may I ask one 
more time to make sure the Transportation Capacity Credit is worded properly.

Thanks for your help and making time for me this morning.  I am also sending 
this to Chicago in order for Peoples to have their legal review it also.  I 
am also going to visit with credit, but if you know of anything credit wise 
that should be in here, please let me know.

Thanks,

Steve
