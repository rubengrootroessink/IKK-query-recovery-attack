Just wanted to let you know that I still have not received word from either 
attorney about their acceptance.  So, we haven't received the gty yet.  Let 
me know what we should do.

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Veronica Espinoza
