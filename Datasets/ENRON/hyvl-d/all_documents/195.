Dan,
The GSA doc was apparently corrupted in transit.
All others are accessible.
Could you please resend only the GSA doc.

Thank you,
Doug

Attached below are hopefully the final versions of the related agreements.
Please print out at least three orginials of each for execution.  I should
have the recording information back by Monday on the Enernet liens which I
will include in the next version of the Mortgage exhibit as well as a
notation that the bank mortgage was subordinated to the enron mortgage.
Please call if you have any questions.
