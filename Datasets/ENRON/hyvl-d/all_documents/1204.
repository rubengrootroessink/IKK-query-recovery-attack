Dan, thanks for your help on this. I've forwarded the latest to John Ulrich
for signature.  In case I forget, please remind me to send you a certified
copy of the resolution.  I know it's been signed by all, including the
mayor.  The PG&E bankruptcy has taken up a lot of my attention, and I may
not remember to ensure that staff gets a copy to send with the executed
contract.  Grant Kolling.

Grant,
     One last change,  Kim Ward agreed to reduce the penalty provisions in
3.2 and 3.4 from $0.15 to $0.015.  The rest of the contract was unchanged.
As stated in previous email, please forward two signed originals to me for
Enron's further handling.
