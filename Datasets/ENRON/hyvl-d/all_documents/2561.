>> The Perfect Woman
>>
>> Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect
>> courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life
>> together was, of course, perfect.
>>
>> One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple were driving their
>> perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road,
>> when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the
>> perfect couple, they stopped to help.
>>
>> There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to
>> disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the
>> perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.
>>
>> Soon they were driving along delivering the toys. Unfortunately, the
>> driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and
>> Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident.
>>
>>
>>                             Who was the survivor? (Scroll down for the
>> answer.)

>> Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus; and, there is no such thing as a

>> This explains why there was a car accident.

>> By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates
>> another point: women never listen either.
