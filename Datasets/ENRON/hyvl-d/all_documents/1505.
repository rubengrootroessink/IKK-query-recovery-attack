Yes, I do.  We had all discussed it and decided to use a "belt and 
suspenders" approach and reserved the rights, if any.  You're probably right 
not to mention them.

Thanks!

Candace,
 If you look at your purchase document, you will see that you never received 
the minerals.  Do you agree?

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the 
above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want 
to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like 
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Thanks, Dan.

Candy
