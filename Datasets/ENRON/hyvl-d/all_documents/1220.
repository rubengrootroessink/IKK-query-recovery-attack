Everyone, revised contracts from Enron.

Mike - both contracts now attached with the updated clause. Dan stated he
does not need to re sign the assignment. If you need clarification please
contact Dan directly. Based on this Enron is done.

Kelvin, the agreement you need to print off is 2001-023acrfm.doc

Now it is up the the lawyers to get the documents signed at BP and Gulf.

Please advise Jim Pearson or myself once all agreements are signed and we
can start flowing AOS via BP

Thanks,

Grant,
     Bruce called to say the language is okay.  Hunter also confirmed the
language.  Please print out the attached confirms and forward them to
Crestar.  Hopefully this is the last time.
