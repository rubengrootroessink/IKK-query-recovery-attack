Subject: Sections 17.1 and 17.2



     Attached is a redlined version of Sections 17.1 and 17.2, which
     reflect ECT's comments on the default payments.  We divided the
     Sections into subsections for easier viewing.  Please let us know if
     the changes on the attached redline are acceptable to everyone.

     Thanks.
