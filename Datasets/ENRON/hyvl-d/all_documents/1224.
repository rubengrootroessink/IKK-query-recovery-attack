FEMALE HORMONES IN BEER

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that men should take a
look
at their beer consumption, considering the results of a recent analysis that

revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The theory is that
drinking
beer makes men turn into women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each. It was then
observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without
making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally,
argued over nothing and refused to apologize when wrong. No further testing
is
planned.
