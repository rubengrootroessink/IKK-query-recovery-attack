I ran a total on the Medicare Bills that I will be submitting to Dad's 
alternate
Insurance Co.   Most of these bills have been paid by Dow insurance so we are 
in
good shape as of $$ still owed.   Anyway when I finished compiling the list,
total was about $12,145.   I'm waiting on MD Anderson to sent me a copy of the
pathology report before I actually file.

Thought you guys might be interested to know this tad bit of info.
