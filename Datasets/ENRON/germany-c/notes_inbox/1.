Re:  Texas Gas Rate Changes Effective 1/1/01

On November 30, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-
135-000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement in Docket No.
RP97-344, in which the Commission required Texas Gas to
reduce certain Account No. 858 contracts.  In the instant
filing Texas Gas proposes to reflect rate reductions
resulting from the termination of the HIOS T-17 contract.
Included in the filing were revised rates under Texas Gas'
Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render service to
its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.  The revised
tariff sheets have a proposed effective date of January 1,
2001.  If accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas tariff
sheets would result in the following changes in Transco's
current Rate Schedule FT-NT Rates:


Zone SL Demand Charge -  $0.0192 decrease
Zone 1 Demand Charge  -  $0.0192 decrease


Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department,
