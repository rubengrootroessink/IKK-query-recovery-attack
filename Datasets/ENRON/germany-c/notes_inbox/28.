Subject: Dominion Transmission Gathering Charges

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG 
Transmission)  announced that they have reached a five year agreement on 
gathering rates.  Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval, 
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001.  Under the agreement, 
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for 
gathering or processing.  Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention 
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing.  They are:

                                                       1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003   
                 7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry                                       
0                                                          0
Transmission Wet                                  
3.91%                                                  3.51%
Gathering Dry                                           
9.34%                                                   9.34%
Gathering Wet                                          
13.25%                                               12.85%           

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate  the 
production information to the producer and/or his agent.  My guess is that 
they will send a  monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each 
meter.  The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter 
(a gross volume) .  This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage 
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or 
processing).  The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer 
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing.  There will be no 
additional charges.  ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.
