To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO schedulers are still using CES 
accounts, because several agency deals' paperwork has not been signed to give 
Enron the rights to nominate the gas. 

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not 
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and 
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is 
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas. 

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and 
processed... so we can stop CES's ability to look at Enron's nominations.

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp 
processed, we can start using Enron's account. I could eliminate CES's 
account access to Enron and Calp. I would still have access to CES's account 
for the other agency nominations until the paperwork signed. The other agency 
nominations are currently low maintenance.
