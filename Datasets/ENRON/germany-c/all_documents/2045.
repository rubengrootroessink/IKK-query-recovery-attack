After talking to Victor, he said this was the correct process. I'm thinking 
Joann  can update the CES and Calp tickets in the morning when she runs the 
new navigator reports. Joann can also update Dayton's ticket in the afternoon 
from our spreadsheet or Steve's. 

Joann, let me or Robert know if you need some help in updating these tickets.

Thanks.

Now that TCO has slowed down... want to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Chris helped TCO out in January by updating the Transport Tickets. Chris 
thought we were updating the tickets in February. We thought Chris was 
updating the tickets. Unfortunately.. they were not updated.

Starting with March Forward... please advise if this is the correct process.

Sitara #

95448 = 180,000  This ticket will be used for Enron North America as Shipper??
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

165985 = 50,000  This ticket will be used for Dayton as Shipper??
   We have a daily Dayton spreadsheet that we use to schedule from and Steve 
Gillespie also sends out a daily sheet.

165984 = 20,000  This ticket will be used for Calp as Shipper??  
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

Let me know if we are thinking this through correctly.

Thanks for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!
