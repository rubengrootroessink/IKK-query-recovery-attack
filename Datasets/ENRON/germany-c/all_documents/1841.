We have received 29 of the agency designation forms back.  I am sending a 
copy of them to CNR and Sylvia Campos today.  Does anyone else need a copy?
Thanks,
Heidi

Subject: CNR Producers not in Global.

I have set up all the CNR contracts in Sitara for almost all of the accounts 
that came over from CES, except for the following: Global is waiting for the 
agent assignment letters from these producers in order to get them in our 
system. Heidi or Jill, do you'all know who the assignment letters willl be 
mailed to after each producer has signed them? Thanks, Rob
