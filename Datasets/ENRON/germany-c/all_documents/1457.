Heidi,
Attached is a worksheet of what BBC should bill us for the March NYSEG Gas.  
This differs from you sent to Lori @ BBC  in that we are committed to take 
1,000 per day @ NYMEX plus $.61.   Therefore I allocated volumes to the 
1,000/day committment.  I will fax this to BBC.
Call me when you have time.
John
