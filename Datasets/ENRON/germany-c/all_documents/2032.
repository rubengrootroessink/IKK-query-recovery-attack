Okay... to ensure we are all on the same page. I've talked to Jill 
Linkenauger and Heidi Griffith... and the following will be done.

Jill has forwarded to Heidi the CNR file for CES customers and their 
addresses. Jill also forwarded the appropriate form that needs to be sent to 
the producers, signed, and return to Enron.

Terry Franklin will be the Enron North America contact on the form for these 
CNR producers (Jill estimates about 50 CES producers). 

Later this week, Heidi will send the form to the CNR's CES customers. Heidi 
will put Terry's phone number and address on the form.

We will need the Appalachian Traders (John Singer, Jim Javins, Jill 
Linkenauger) to encourage the producers to sign this paper work and get it 
back to Enron ASAP. We want the change over done by April estimates.

Jill said if the change did not happen in time for April estimates, she would 
help send out the ascii file one more time. At the end of March, Jill will 
end her employment with CES... so we can't depend on her in the future months 
for this ascii file.

Thanks again for everyone's help in getting the change over done ASAP.
