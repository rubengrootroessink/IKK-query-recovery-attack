Darn it... I tried to hit the 1,125,300, just off slightly. Actuals ended at 
1,121,733. I'm short by 3567 dkt. 

I looked at intraday temperatures on Friday, and it appeared March 31st 
(Friday) was going to be colder. Oh well... hope this is close enough!!

Okay... we are getting into the last week and we are still about 20,000 short 
reaching our total month withdrawal goal of 1,125,300. 

Because Choice burns are backing off significantly, I've matched 100 percent 
Choice burn to storage withdrawal. Joann Collins will baseload 10,000/day 
storage withdrawal to her CES markets starting with 3/24/2000. This will help 
us meet our goal. We will review this daily.

Thanks.

We have reached the last ratchet at 67,371. In yesterday's meeting with TCO 
pipeline, it was confirmed that we should call gas control direct  
304-357-2606, when we true-up choice and the storage withdrawal exceeds the 
67,371. Because of TCO's new stance of enforcing penalties, please write down 
the date, time, and person you talk to at TCO to allow this. 

I also bumped up 3/17's storage withdrawal to better match the end of month 
target. 

Thanks.

Subject: Choice Storage Withdrawal - March 2000

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
