NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.
