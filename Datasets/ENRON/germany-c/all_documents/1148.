FYI.  Commonwealth is adding five new meters to their existing contract.  
These meters (4137901, 4132101, 4235001, 4134301, and 4132201) are all at 
Bridgeport and are expected to produce about 75 dths a day.  These meters are 
expected to come on for the 7/00 production period.  If anyone has any 
questions, please contact Jim (614) 791-6107.

Thanks,
Heidi
