Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes), the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.
