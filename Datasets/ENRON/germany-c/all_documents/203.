NEWS FLASH!!!!

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. Finding 
enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.
