If I'm reading this correctly, this is for the CES sale to Metro Media.  I 
entered a sale in the system for a volume of 12,120 dth/day (deal 282945).  
The price is IF CGAS + $.0175 + Variable Cost + $.02 demand (if we use ENA 
transport).  Charlie and I can chat about the transport after bid week.

Molly, CES will not include these volumes on the FOM sheet.  I added a 
worksheet in the CES transport file for these volumes.

Please forward this on to anyone else that needs to see it and as always, 
don't hesitate to call if you have questions.

Joann,

Here is the distribution of the CES EU deal that Chris did with Charlie last
week.  The original deal volume was
for 263,580 dth/month. Doug could you please ask Chris if he will keep us 
whole
on the contracted price for
the extra 20,000 dth?

Joann pls call me if you have trouble reading this.  Please note that the
volumes to 8-35 are for TIMET only (k64939).

Thanks,
Kara
