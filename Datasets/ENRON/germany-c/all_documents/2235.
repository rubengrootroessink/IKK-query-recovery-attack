Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with Craig
Taylor.  Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann,  I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it 
was
included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat this as 
a
financial deal.  Ask Scott Goodell to put it in.  I can't get into our lovely
Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail.  Also, if there are no
constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this will
not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of the
month.

Sorry guys!!

On Jan 28th Brian did a spot deal with Chris for a total of 26817 dth to COH 
at
$3.06.  I did not include these volumes in my first of the month numbers
unfortunately so if you could hook me up now that would be much appreciated.
Here's the breakdown by market area:

5-2 1577

7-1 1823

7-5 22717

7-9 700

Please start the deliveries on the 10th.  I don't care how you deliver the
others but for 7-5 please prorate for the rest of the month if possible (1136
dth/day).

Thanks very much,
KD
