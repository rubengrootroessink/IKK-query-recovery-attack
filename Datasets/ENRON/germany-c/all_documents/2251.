For January 2000 for a couple of weekends SJersey tried to do intradays.  Due 
to the interconnect and other supply we were not able to change their 
nominations.  South Jersey have always been told that changing nomination on 
the weekend would be on best available.  Julie Punches from Sjersey due to 
her changes on the weekend is over at some of her CDC markets is asking to 
allocate the excess gas to CES agg pools.  
Would this be something Enron would do???
