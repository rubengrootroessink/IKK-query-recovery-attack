sorry, got Aug mixed up with Sep. Should be 786,579 dth for the month of Sep,
or 26,219.3/day. Chris, since it doesn't round evenly to a daily number, 
please
credit us for the monthly volume. That is why we were off by 26 dth ending
July.

Chris;
The 23,060/day volume is an annual imbalance true-up that we needed to buy 
from
CES and take physically.  We are not geared to market yet, so I baseloaded 
with
Dick.

Chris;
Have you received an answer on the the COH injection?  Jeff, please follow up.

Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the
citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?
