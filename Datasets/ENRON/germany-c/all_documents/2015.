Gloria,
I'm sorry but as a manager, I spent the vast portion of my days and evenings 
involved in trading activities, in  meetings and trying to put out fires.  I 
have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I 
usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening.  Some are 
quick fixes, but the majority lately have not been.  Todays calendar isn't 
looking much better.

I contacted Wade on this last week, but have not received anything.  I hate 
to hold you back from making your payments, which is why we have spent 
another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to 
handle these types of requests.  That position is now to be filled by Teri 
Franklin.  I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as 
sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.  

So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to 
suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade 
and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.  
If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from 
setting up deals with incorrect pricing.  Which then causes us to have to go 
back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the 
error, which is exactly what I received an
email on earlier this morning.  


Teri,

If you need any help with sitara or any other type of training in setting up 
these deals, please let either myself, Victor, Chris, or Brenda know and we 
will try to answer your questions.  Thanks for your help!

Kathy

Katherine - what is the status on the Triad and Pacific Atlantic?  Lashonda 
or Wade should be able to
give you pricing.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

These should all now be done now, with the exception of the two Triad ENergy 
meters and meter 3582101 for Pacific Atlantic.  I couldn't find any previous 
deals for Triad ENergy at all or for that meter of Pacific Atlantic.  I can 
set up new tickets, but I will need how they should be priced.
