June nomination into the pool should have been 500 Mcfd of production gas 
(from Phillips) and 7,500 Dth of pool gas from Power Gas Marketing.  You 
should check with Heidi Boyd @ CES for the actual noms into the pool.  She 
should have nominated these volumnes into CES's pool since ENA does not have 
a pool.
As far as I know, the pool to pool transfer fee is $0.04/Dth or $100.00 which 
ever is LESS.  Therefore,  for volumes over 2,500 the transfer fee should be 
$100.00 no matter what the volume is.

Phillips' contract for 500 MCFD metered production  goes through NOVEMBER 
(this volume may be less because of high line pressures).
Power Gas Marketing's contract for 7,500 Dth /Month pool to pool goes through 
OCTOBER.

If Clinton is interested in the volumes through contract expiration, I can 
ask Phillips to grant us permission to move the meters into Clinton's pool.

I'm chating with Clinton about this gas.  Is it 500 dth per day or 500 mcf 
per day?  Also, does he have to take this from our pool where we pay $.08 per 
dt or can we give him metered production?

I ask Heidi Boyd to reduce the May production noms from 800/day to 500/day.
I ask here to nominate 500/day for June.
I was unable to sell any PNG to Amerda Hess (StatOil), therefore we will be 
cashed out by PNG for June.
