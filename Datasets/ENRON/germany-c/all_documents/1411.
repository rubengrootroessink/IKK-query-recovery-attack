Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie
