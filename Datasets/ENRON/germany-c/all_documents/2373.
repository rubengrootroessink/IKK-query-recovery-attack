  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.
