Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little 
wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own.  These wells 
produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day.  Most are very minimal, 
probably 500 dt's or less.  This production is produced on several gathering 
lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas.  A couple of years ago Columbia Gas 
started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to 
Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by 
Columbia Gas.  Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco 
and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and 
then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time.  
The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe.  
We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us 
credit for it in our pool.  Sounds simple.  The problem comes three months 
down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at 
these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these 
little producers. 

Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us.  Client Services would just zero 
out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add 
each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment 
to each.  It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who 
was solely devoted to doing nothing but this.  Because unify was developed to 
put as much work up front in the process, client services no longer has the 
'back door' to get the payment out the door.  This means that each well that 
we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara  with a 
volume of 0 (currently our responsibility to set up) and must have at least 
one path with a volume of 1 for each month in unify.  Several months ago 
after converting to unify, Robert, Molly Lafuze, Kathy Moore, and Victor put 
in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our 
own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs.  
Generally, it's the same meters that flow and when we set them up, we do it 
over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and 
as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing, we're just in maintenance 
mode.  However, sometimes new wells come up, at which point the process is to 
1) have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties, 2) set up 
a deal in sitara, 3) put a path in unify with a volume of 1, 4) create noms, 
and 5) track and balance.  Since we don't even get actuals to 3 months after 
flow, we usually have at least 3 to 4 months of catch up to do.  And of 
course, as you are aware, our systems have been running a little slow lately.

With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas.  I've 
heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is, but I'm sorry, 
the number seems to have escaped me.  I know it is at least several hundred 
and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously. 

This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people 
including myself, Chris Germany, John Singer, Jim Javins, and Scott Neal on 
more than one occasion.  One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was 
to have someone named Hiedi in Jim's office get access to our systems and 
input the gas herself.  Seems like a nice suggestion, except that she is EES 
and I don't think that we want her in our sytems.  By the way, John Singer 
and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas.  They picked Hiedi 
because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give 
these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand.  
Yes, it's hard to believe but it's the ones getting the $50 checks that 
complain the most.  They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for 
making the payments.  

Anyway, that suggestion wasn't really panning out, so another suggestion has 
arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the 
metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity.  First, we 
would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our 
flexibility on Columbia Gas.   I'm not totally sure how to go about getting 
something like this off the ground, but it does have merit.  Another thought 
was to hire someone here that's sole responsibility would be the metered 
supply.  They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work 
closely with Gloria in client services, Jim Javins and John Singer.  The 
thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal.  Chris and I 
tend to disagree in this area.  he thinks there is plenty of work for a full 
time person.  My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special 
project over the course of some time, but that once the initial push to get 
the meters in is done that it is more of a part-time responsibility.  The big 
problem with that though is right now, the guys downstairs don't even have 
time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for 
Gloria to do them herself, if she has proper training and access to our 
systems.  However, regardless of which group gets the responsibility, there 
is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so 
when January actuals come in and we should be prepared.

Any way, please give it some thought and let me know if you have any 
suggestions.  I'd also like to here what your views might be.  

Thanks!

Kathy, who are we doing this for and why? This isn't CES business is it?

Please get back to me, thanks - Bob

Bob, 

After talking with Robert about this request this morning, I told him that I 
would look at future option, but that in the meantime I would go ahead and 
take care of these for Gloria.  Well, to my shock, it took over three hours 
for me to complete the task of setting up 2 deal in sitara and adding and 
pathing 9 meters in unify over the course of six months.  I'm not sure why I 
thought this, but I thought it might take 30 maybe 45 minutes.  The whole 
process is really rather simple, just very time consuming.  What scares me is 
that we are soon going to be having to do exactly this same thing for the 
hundreds of metered production wells that have come over with the CES 
acquisition.  At the current rate of business that we are doing, I just don't 
see how will be able to accomplish this with our current resources.

We still have some time before we need to make a decision, but a couple of 
possible solutions would be 1) bring in some temporary help for a short 
period of time or 2)  give Gloria access to help out with this, but then we 
give up part of the control of our systems to other group.

ED/KATHY,  Please help.  There's gotta be a way that client services can add 
these producer meters and ZERO paths that are so old or learn how to do it!  
Volumes are minimal and the TCO guys are swamped.  I'm sure the SOUTHEAST 
schedulers get the same type of request from client services or they will 
with the CES wellhead stuff.  We don't have time to do the research for this 
stuff, set up the meters and the tickets and the counterparties for little or 
no volume that's from JULY of 1999!!! HELLO That was a millenium ago!!! Can 
you tell I'm a little emotional about this?  There is no value added to 
something after the fact for the desk on this one.  What do y'all 
think??????????

Robert - can you do these?  I don't think this is something that I can do.
Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118
