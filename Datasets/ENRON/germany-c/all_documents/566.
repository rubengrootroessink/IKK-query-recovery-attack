The new job  is great so far.  I am starting to get busy, which is good, but 
I am a little overwhelmed.  I really think I am going to like this rotation.  
The hours are good so far.  I get in at around 8:00AM and leave around 
5:30PM.  Pretty normal!  I have been relaxing a lot at night.  I am trying to 
save some money so I am not going out as much.  I have also been swimming at 
the YMCA  on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  That's all that's new over here.  

Stay warm on your motorcycle!!

Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some 
winter motorcycle gear.  My brother and I are taking a biking trip in 
November - don't know where we are going yet.  

How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now?

Long time no talk.  How have you been?  Have you been riding your motorcycle 
a lot?  Maybe we can go to Barnaby's next week.
