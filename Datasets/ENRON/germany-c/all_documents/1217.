Don't execute it yet, it should have been released to MME for Jun. I'll talk 
to
MME/LILCO.

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

thanks
