Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some of 
Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature swings 
that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50 split 
with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and overdelivery 
gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved through Jeff Porter, 
the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial holiday" 
for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.

7-1: 67693 11558

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
