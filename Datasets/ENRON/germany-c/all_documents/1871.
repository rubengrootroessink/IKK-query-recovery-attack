Steve--The attached file contains estimates for the upcoming 12-month period 
of
our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

Thanks.
