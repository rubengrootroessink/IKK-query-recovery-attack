Re:  1Line System Updates

A series of Power Point presentations have been made available
on Transit that describe the upcoming changes for the new 1Line
system that will be implemented next year.  These presentations
can be accessed by right clicking on the 1Line System Updates
line that is located on the home page after you have logged into
Transit.  They are available in both a Power Point and an HTML
format.  The presentations that are on Transit are:

1Line Presentation (11-07-00) Tariff Changes Presentation from
Winter Operations meeting
1Line Pooling Process Changes
1Line Operational Impact Areas
1Line Behind the Meter Process Changes
1Line Receipt Point Allocation Process Changes
1Line Delivery Point Allocation Process Changes
1Line OBAs
1Line Confirmation Process Changes
1Line Tracking a Transaction
1Line Invoicing Process Changes
1Line Customer Updates (8-25-00) Brief Overview of 1Line Changes

These presentations are also available on the 1Line web site at
www.1line.williams.com under the General Information section in
the upper right corner.  The 1Line web site also has a reference
table for business associates showing the current business party
name and number cross referenced to the future 1Line business
associate name and number.  This table is located in the Cross
Reference section of the 1Line web site.  Additional cross-
reference tables for locations and contracts will be posted as
they are available.  The cross-reference tables will be updated
periodically.

You are encouraged to read these presentations and to contact
your Scheduling analyst or Customer Services representative with
any questions you may have.
