Subject: RE: Equitrans Pool


Good morning.   I did locate the pooling agreement request form.   We had
originally talked about mailing these to you but faxing would be quicker.  I
am faxing that to you this morning.   It needs to be completed and faxed
back to us as soon as you can.   Also,  I am faxing a Pool Meter List form
and a Pool Operator Confirmation form (these are also available on our
website (www.equitrans.com) under the Equipath menu option.)

The Pool Meter List form needs to list all meters that you are placing in
your pool.   The Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to list all of
the shippers and their contracts that will be nominating out of your pool.


The Pool Meter List and the Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to be
completed monthly.  Normally these are due to Equitrans 30 days prior to gas
flow.  We will make an exception for August as this will be your first
month.  Try to have the latter two forms to us by mid July.
