For 1/19th we have sold the extra capacity to Amoco(5,000) and BGE 
Citygate(5,000).  I sent earlier this morning a email concerning price.  
Please let me know about the 19th to BGE???

JoAnn,

Due to the OFO on the BGE system until Friday 01-21-2000, I will need
incremental gas in the amount of 7,000 dth. per day for gas day Wednesday
01-19-2000, Thursday 01-20-2000, and Friday 01-21-2000 a delivered volume of
7,000 dth. each day for a total delivered volume of 21,000 dth.


Kara, if BGE requests call for a reduction for  residential customers  due to
requirements please do not reduce any gas delivered.  We can use this in
addition to the 7,000 dth.also to service our end user customers.   Just let
the gas flow.


Please let me know what K# you will deliver this on.  If you have any 
questions
please give me a call.

Thank You.

Fred
