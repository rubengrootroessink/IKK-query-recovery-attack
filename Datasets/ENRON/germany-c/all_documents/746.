Thanks for sharing your pix with me.? I especially enjoyed the pictures of 
your father's tractor and his kids, very cute.? I'll be in the northeast this 
weekend, too.? I plan to go to an Italian festival in NYC on Fri nite (major 
food fest!) and on Saturday I'm touring wineries on Long Island.? Enjoy 
Maryland!

I'm glad you like your gifts.? I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I 
took up sewing (for Hector) and metal working type stuff for your goodies. 
I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.? I'm out Friday, Monday, 
and Tuesday. 

AND I've been putting photo's on the web.? I bought a digital camera.? Take 
a look .? Go to ==>? http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp 
Then go to the box in the bottom right side of the screen where it says 
"new to cartogra?".? Enter my account name "trogg522" in the space beneath 
and click on the arrow. 

Later :o)

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not 
be at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of 
the afternoon. 

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon. 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both. 

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up 
the Enron part. 

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and 
catchup.? :) 

Take care.?? ii
