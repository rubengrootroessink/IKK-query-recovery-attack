Joan--With respect to CES's TCO storage for the COH choice program, please
schedule 48,000 dth/day to be withdrawn for the last 6 days of Februray.  If
necessary, CES will sell back flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the
storage withdrawal at this level.    If TCO imposes some sort of operational
limits that prevent us from pulling this amount, please pull as much as you 
can
up to this amount without violating the limits or otherwise incurring
penalties.


Thanks and please call me if you have questions, comments, etc.
