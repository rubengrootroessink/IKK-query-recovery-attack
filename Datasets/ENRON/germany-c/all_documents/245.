try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.
