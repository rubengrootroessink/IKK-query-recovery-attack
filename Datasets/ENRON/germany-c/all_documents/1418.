Mark - below is TGT's offer for a 1, 3, and 5 year deal.  Please note that 
the (crappy) quote below does not include a fuel adder.   Fuel is approx. 
3.4% in the winter and 2.7% in the summer.  You will probably get a better 
quote from the desk.  My guess is they will offer something in the area of I 
plus $0.28 or $0.29, but you'll need to get a quote from them directly.

Chris:

Sorry for the delay in this response things have been crazy.  Outlined below
is a quote for pricing from TGT Zone SL to Zone 4 with the various terms you
requested.  Keep in mind that this capacity is subject to the bidding
process and this is simply a proposal based on capacity available to date.
The proposed rates are as follows:

  Demand Charges per MMBtu
Term  Summer Winter
1 Year $.21  Max Rates which are currently $.3074
3 Years $.20  Max Rates which are  currently $.3074
5 Years $.19  Max Rates which are currently $.3074

The rates above do not reflect the currently filed commodity charge of $.0417
and do not include the applicable fuel retention.  The max rates listed for
service in the winter will be adjusted according to the currently filed max
rates at the time service is rendered.
