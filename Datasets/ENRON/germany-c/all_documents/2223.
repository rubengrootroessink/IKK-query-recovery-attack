Joann,

Please redirect the following:

from mkt 7-3 cut 9039 dth total off K61822 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

from mkt 7-8 cut 6413 dth total off K65402 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

In addition to the redirects, I am also requesting more gas delivered to 7-1
from you, 13500 dth total, if you could please prorate that through the rest 
of
the month as well.

We can start this on the 12th if that works for you.

Thank you!
Kara
