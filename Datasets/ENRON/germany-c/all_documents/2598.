Chris Germany is responsible for all the retail volume. I was only given 
Dayton STORAGE positions to book. If there are other dayton positions I do 
not have them.

HELP!!

Kathy just received these retail volumes from CES for a number of pipes.
The Texas gas deals at the end of this email are nowhere in sitara.  Are 
these deals suppose to be entered by Chris since they are "retail" or is the 
Dayton Power and Light deal suppose to be entered by you guys under that 
Desk?  Are you guys done entering the Dayton Desk deals??

Thanks
Trish

I just received this memo from Phil at CES.  It appears to be from their 
retail group in Pittsburgh.  I'm looking into this, but from what I'm hearing 
we are supplying this gas to the retail group and need to make sure that it 
is scheduled.  Please check on these immediatly since the LDC deadlines start 
today.
