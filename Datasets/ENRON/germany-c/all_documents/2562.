Hi Everybody,

I haven't input my CPA 8 numbers yet, I am still sorting them into market
areas.  I am not sure that my numbers are correct due to production and
wholesale issues.  I am hoping to have a couple of people look over my work,
but so far they have been unavailable when I finally got my numbers together.

I appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience.

Thanks.
