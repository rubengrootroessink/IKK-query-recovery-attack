No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.

I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.
