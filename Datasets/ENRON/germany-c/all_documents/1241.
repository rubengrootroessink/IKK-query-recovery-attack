Chris-
On the 31st we parked a grand total of 37,503.  That will change the number 
we are pulling out in June won't it?  Will you let me know what the new 
volume will be?  I'll talk to you tom. about the fuel percent stuff.  Thank 
you!  -AZ

These numbers will change a little but this is what we currently have in the 
system.

Parking in May  55,150 dth/total (deal 281565)
Taking out in June 1,837 dth/day  (deal 281556)

I'm not sure if the May numbers are net of fuel and we don't have an exact 
parking number for today as well.

David, where do I show the $.04 parking fee.  We are paying $.04 times the 
total volume parked, not the daily balance.

We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we 
are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is 
paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know.
