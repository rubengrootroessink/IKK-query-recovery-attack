Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
 Originally CES'.  Assigned to ENA.
 19-26 3
 19-27 23
 19-32 4 
 19E (19-25) 34
 Rec-Leach 64

2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.  
 I don't see a break between Commerical and Retail, can you provide more 
information?

3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
 Rec MLI 1000 Volume of 2000
 Del MLI 23-9 Volume of 2000
 Thru 12/31/2000
 
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
 Rec- Leach

5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's? 
 5A2292 Enron North America released from CES 5A2289 2/00   476/d
 5A2291 ENA from CEM 5A2288  2/00  422/d
 5A2181 and 5A2182 Appear in the EBB as CES for January.
  ENA was the agent 
 
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below
 No info provided,  was a file attached to this original email?

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
 Sounds like a PSNC type volume.  Can you verify?

8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
 YES
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also? 
 The 1440/d from Dayton on TXGAS is released monthly (to ENA).

10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?
 All the retail contract, O&R, CMD, COH, etc.  Both FTS-1 and FTS-2.
