Trish looked at these and said that the Boston releases were done at Peak, but
the re-releases were done at Seasonal.  I would call Trish to discuss possibly
terminating and re-doing the re-releases.

Enjoyed lunch!   Steph

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June
1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Contract  Deal      Comment
779234         003589         Boston releasing to CES
771157         003668         CES releasing to ENA
771224         003786         ENA releasing to Energy Express

Contract  Deal      Comment
779233         003581         Boston releasing to CES

771225         003785         ENA releasing to Energy Express



Thanks.
