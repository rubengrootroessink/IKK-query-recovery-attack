I assume that since we mention on the GTC "If a Transaction includes a 
Receipt Location or a Delivery Location which is specified as a zone...." 
We will need to include it on the Long Description- i.e. on CGAS Leach-M28 we 
should have
The transaction is for non-recallable transportation capacity on Columbia Gas 
Transmission Corporation Pipeline (the Reference Pipeline) under the FTS Rate 
Schedule (the Rate Schedule) from Leach Point (the Receipt Location) to Zone 
M28 (the Delivery Location).
Please let me know if this is correct, or if we need to specify which zone, 
pls let me know.
Thanks
Carlos
