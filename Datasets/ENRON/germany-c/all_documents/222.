Subject: EMAZING Joke of the Day - Bill At The Ballgame




Bill At The Ballgame

It was the first game of the season. President Clinton and

the First Lady were invited to opening day at Yankee

Stadium. Right before the game started, the President

picked up Hillary and threw her onto the field. George

Steinbrenner turned around and shouted, "No, Mr. President,

I said throw the first PITCH!"
