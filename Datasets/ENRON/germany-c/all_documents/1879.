Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.
