Re:     Major 2001 Construction Projects

The projects listed below are the major pipeline and station
construction projects that are currently scheduled for the 2001
construction season.  Dates and duration of these jobs may change prior
to construction.  Additional information will be forthcoming on a
particular job if there are significant impacts to available capacity.

Unless specifically stated to the contrary, the following jobs will not
impact firm transportation.  However, based on past summer operating
conditions, it is anticipated that interruptible transportation services
(IT and secondary FT) may be impacted by some of the work.  The extent
of the impact will depend on operating conditions at the time of the
outages.
