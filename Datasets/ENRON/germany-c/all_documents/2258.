Novec is pulling 178 dth/d from Enron's M/L pool via an entity called 
America's Energy. There is 103 dth/d that is labeledas CES which is not 
connecting on Navigator. Do you know who this belongs to?

Subject: CES sale at Mainline

According to Brian at CES, we sold CES 2987/month for Feb and 2387/month for 
Mar at CGLF Mainline (deal 150380).  Brian said the customer is Novac and 
that Cindy might have a contact there.  

Let me know if we still have problems.

Thanks
