Per our previous conversations, we want the right to match any bids (ROFR for

we
renew.

Jeff and Charlie- Julie Watkins at Columbia Gas called to see if we want to
evoke CES/ENA's Right of First Refusal on the following contracts.  If we
say yes, they will post the capacity for bids, then we have a right to
match.  If we say no, they will post the capacity without us.
All are priced at $5.171, but can go up if someone bids up.  They expire
10/31/2000.
