Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.
