We need to go ahead and pay them.  The question really at this point is not 
if there is a deal, but whether there is a true up required with CES

Please look into this city gate production for T & F Operating at 
CPA/PennFuel.  Invoices for Jan-00 and Feb-00 are in and due. Purchase Deal 
is 142786 . The contract   96029913 still has the CES - T & F Operating  
party name (as does the deal).

Per John Singer, this deal is for 10000 per month @ $3.465 for  01/00 - 03/00 
, @ $2.85 for 04/00 - 10/00  .  (by the way, they billed in MCFs).  

 I need to get this paid ASAP.  Please look into this and set up the sale as 
needed..

Thanks  WRP
