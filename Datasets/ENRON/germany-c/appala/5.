I would say the contact is Chris Germany at ENA.  His number is 713 
853-4743.  We should be paying ENA on actual volume produced.  If not, we 
will need to make an adjustment to the prior invoices. 

Pat - we should probably talk about this.

Who is your contact at Enron for this pool, name and phone number?  I would 
like to contact them about the invoicing and trueup on this pool.
