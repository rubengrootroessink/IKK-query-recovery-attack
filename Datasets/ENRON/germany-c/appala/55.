The metered production from Questa Petroleum is  "Behind CPA city gate".  
Questa's meter is in CES's Columbia of Pa Pool (or CDC Pool).  Heidi Boyd 
nominates this gas to the CES Retail customers each month from the pool.  
This gas is in addition to any other gas provided for CES by ENA.  Since it 
is "Behind the City Gate" no one at ENA has to nominate the physical flow of 
the gas.  The only reason a nomination needs to be made by an ENA scheduler 
is to allow payment to the producer.

 Chris Germany should be including this gas in the invoice for CES Retail.

This gas is under contract through October 2000.
