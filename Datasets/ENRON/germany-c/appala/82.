We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never 
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both 
the production and the end-user side.

Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production?

I have no contacts to buy from.  Mountaineer production is normally sold on 
term deals.

CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.  The request 
was made by Kim Novesak??

I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or 
Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.
