FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please 
forward this on to anyone that needs to schedule this gas.  I'm not real sure 
who is doing your noms on CNG.

Thanks,
Heidi
