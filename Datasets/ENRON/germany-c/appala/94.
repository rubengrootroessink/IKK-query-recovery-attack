Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob
