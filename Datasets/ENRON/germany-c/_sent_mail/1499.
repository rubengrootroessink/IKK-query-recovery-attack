Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your 
flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 
3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  

Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE 
HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

Thanks,
HG
