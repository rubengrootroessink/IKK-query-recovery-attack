I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on 
it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just 
verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a 
big OA variance for June - August.

This deal is for deliveries to Storage.  Would you verify if ACA and GRI are 
billed for storage deliveries please?
