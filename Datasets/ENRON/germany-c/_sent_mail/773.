Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Chris,
We paid parking fees to Iroquois for 9905 and 9906 production months:

May 1999 $1,934.42       <- included in a wire on 6/18/99 for $1,498,033.81.
June 1999 $1,872.02       <- included in a wire on 7/22/99 for $1,393,799.19.
Total  $3,806.44


If you have any additional questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Chris
