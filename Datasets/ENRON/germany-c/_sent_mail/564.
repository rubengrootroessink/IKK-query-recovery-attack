ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I 
believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA 
released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and 
nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and 
we wanted to transfer title at the pool.

I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.  
He is terminating the agency.
