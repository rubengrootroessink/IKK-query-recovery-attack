According to Brenda we owe Egan 101 dts (per Egan's statement) on the expired 
Egan storage contract.  

Jesse, would you verify this with Egan and find out what they want to do?  

Thanks

Before you leave town, I need an answer on the TETCO demand invoiced for 
August.  Please.

Also, the Egan Hub inventory report for August shows an ending balance of  
(101).  Since the you mentioned that the deal was over, was anything done to 
take the balance to zero in September?

Thanks,
Brenda
