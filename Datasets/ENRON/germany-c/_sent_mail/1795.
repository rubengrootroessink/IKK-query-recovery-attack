Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.

1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at 
NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 
2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.

2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving 
CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay 
Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.

Do you know anything about these deals?
