I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.  Dan will be out Monday 
but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore.  
Judy is out in the afternoons.  

So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.  Vickie's role has not been fully 
explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow.
