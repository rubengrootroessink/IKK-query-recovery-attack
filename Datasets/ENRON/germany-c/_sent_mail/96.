Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

don

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.
