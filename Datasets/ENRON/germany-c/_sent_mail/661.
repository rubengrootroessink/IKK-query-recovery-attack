RE:  Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October 4-6, 2000
(batchmail 09.21.00)

Just a reminder that TODAY, September 21, 2000 is the cut off date for
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting.

If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online
at:

**  http://www.hilton.com/hotels/MYSMHHF/index.html

**  with the hotel directly at 860-572-0731

**  or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS

Use the group code "IGT" to get the Iroquois rate of $135.  After today
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability.

Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on
Wednesday night at the Hilton.  The golf was originally planned for
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for
Wednesday night because of another conference.  There are still plenty
of rooms left for Thursday night.

If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton.  The alternate hotels are
listed on our website at
http://www.iroquois.com/igts/mystic/section-mystic-hotel.html  The first
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from
the Hilton.

While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting,
please do so by September 28.  You can register online at
http://www.iroquois.com/mystic.html.  If you have already registered
online and did not receive an e-mail acknowledgment from Lori Rauser,
please phone her at 203-944-7022 to confirm receipt.

Please contact me if you have any problems with accommodations, or any
other questions about the meeting.  We look forward to seeing you in
October.
