Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.

Later Gator.
