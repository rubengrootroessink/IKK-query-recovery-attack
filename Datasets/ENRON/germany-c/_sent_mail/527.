Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.  
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary 
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide 
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's 
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks 
we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major 
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!
