JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch!

Who's birthday?  I'll probably go.  I might try to go to Branson sometime 
this weekend, but I should be back by then.  Let me know when and where.  
After this Friday, use this as my e-mail:

c1h2a3d4@earthlink.net

or (after mid July)

chad.gronvold@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu

By the way,  how's Stephanie doing?  JD seems to be doing well.
