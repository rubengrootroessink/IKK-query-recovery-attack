Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I 
will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could 
set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first?

Are you planning on working on the gathering contracts or is someone else 
going to enter?

I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm 
gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other 
gathering contracts.

The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,
Brenda
