You're probably gone anyway.  I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".


Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year
Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And
every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs
ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm
71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get
another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not
say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten
dollars."

Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists
and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks
over again, but still not a word.

They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I
could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied,
"Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is
ten dollars."
