I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal.  
I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept 
having problems saving the deal so I created a new one.

Let me know if this works.

Do you know the deal number for this October 1999 demand fee?

I just spoke with Chris, he's going to put the deal into sitara as a parking 
demand for the October 1999 for $10,153.82.

Thanks!

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?
