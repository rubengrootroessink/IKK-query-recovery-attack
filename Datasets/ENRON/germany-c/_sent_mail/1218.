Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates 
are close enough as far as I'm concerned though.

I came up with $2.60218 on Cook School Road for March and $2.93210 for April
(using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you
calculated it.

For Nora I got the same rate you did $2.11
