Angie, please send any CNG EBB postings pertaining to Appalachian production 
to John, Jim, Heidi, Scott, Dick and myself.  I don't think Dick knows what 
email is but send it to him anyway.  Also, when in doubt about the email, 
send it anyway.  EES probably sends the same thing to John, Jim and Heidi.

thanks
