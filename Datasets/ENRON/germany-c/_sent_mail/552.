Brenda, VGS is all buy/sells for us.  VGS delivers directly into Koch, CGULF 
and TETCO.  We sell at the point or deliver into those 3 pipes where we pick 
up on transport.    FTS-2 and IT sounds like Columbia Gulf..Thanks

Nothing is getting flashed on VGS for commodity.  We are paying commodity 
charges on a FTS-2 and an IT contract.  Can you get rates on the usage 
tickets for these contracts?

Thanks,
Brenda
