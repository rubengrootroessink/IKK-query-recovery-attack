DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.
