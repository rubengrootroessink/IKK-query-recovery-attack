Hey buddy.  I would love to take a tour.  I'm tied up with a family illness 
for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.

Great Idea though.

Yesterday I was getting ready to fly out of Fletcher's at Hobby airport when 
a man asked if I was with Enron (he saw my United Way shirt most of us were 
wearing yesterday).  He said that he too was an Enron employee but had missed 
the United Way kick-off event.  He told me he was one of our corporate pilots 
and we spoke for several minutes since I had someone waiting at Houston 
Southwest airport to pick me up.  

I asked if I might arrange with him to get a tour of our corporate hanger and 
airplanes and he said he would be glad to arrange such an event.  I told him 
that several of us pilots at Enron might be interested.  He gave me his card 
and said that he had a trip for Tuesday but to just call him when we were 
ready and he would arrange to make it happen.  Soooo... If you are interested 
or know others who might be, let me know some times and dates and we will 
make this happen.
