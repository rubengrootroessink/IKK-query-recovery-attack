Wade, please forward this to the person that pays Statoil.  AND I just faxed 
you a copy of the invoice Kara faxed me.  I believe Heidi Boyd told me that 
ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me 
know what you find out.

Please include Scott Goodell on all responses.
