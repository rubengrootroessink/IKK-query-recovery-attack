we are probably off because I have not seen Joanne's actual breakdown of sto 
vs pool. Any way we can get a daily confirmation?

This is what I show for the 1st 5 days.  We are off about 552 dth on the 2nd 
and the 3rd, all the other numbers seem close enough.  I had an error in my 
formula.

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.
