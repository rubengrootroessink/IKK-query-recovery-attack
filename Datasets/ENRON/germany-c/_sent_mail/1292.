Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

                                                              Posted 4/3/00

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

 Note:  Throughout the spring and fall, we will be conducting various shut-in 
tests,
 maintenance, and repairs on our storage pools.  While we will make every 
effort 
to mitigate the effect of these tests, they could have some effect on our 
overall operations.
