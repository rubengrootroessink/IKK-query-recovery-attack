Chris, 

I spoke to Rich.? We don't keep records in such a way that would give us the 
temperature at which we restrict Linden.? We determine 
secondary/interruptible space at Linden based on utilization.? Of course 
utilization is ultimately based on temp... but we just don't have an answer 
for you.? Part of the question is, at what temp do northeast LDCs utilize 
their full contract entitlements?
