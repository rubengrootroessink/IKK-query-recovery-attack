Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to 
BUG if this happens.

Subject: FW: Transco Files Motion For Modification of Settlement




Just wanted to make sure all of you saw this notice that we posted on the 
bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant $$$ for some of you.? In 
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund 
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.? 
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final 
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a 
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your 
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final, 
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep.

Happy Halloween.?? ii

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to 
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds 
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000 

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a 
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial 
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, 
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the 
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to 
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting 
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return 
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to 
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set 
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate 
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their 
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to 
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. 

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on 
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the 
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to 
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997 
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have 
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the 
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No. 
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, 
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will 
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any 
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for 
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon 
request. 

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim 
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final 
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital 
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds 
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- 
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on 
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in 
the interim partial refunds.
