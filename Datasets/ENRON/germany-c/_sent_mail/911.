Chris,

How impersonal and Late so first - my apologies.  No excuses but this week 
has been unbelievable.  

I hope that you had an incredible Birthday - I guess you started early since 
I did try to call on Frid.  I hope it was fun.

I bought my self a new BD car!  Kind of exciting.

Today a few of us in my group are headed to the London office! So In my haste 
I wanted to be sure and at least send you a belated birthday wish.

Stephanie
