Chris, 

I created two CES purchase tickets to offset the sales in TRCO Z6 that we are 
not obligated to deliver.  THe ticket numbers are:  345235 and 345230.  I am 
not sure about the pricing on these deals, you might want to take a look at 
them.  If you change something, that is fine, just so that the total volume 
is 494 per day.

Thanks,
Vicki
