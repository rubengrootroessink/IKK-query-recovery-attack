Hello all - sorry for the delay in the agenda.  We've had some discussions 
here
about what to include and it has changed several times!!!

I will attach it and also cut/past it to the end of this e-mail.  I have 
already
heard from some of you - but if you have not, please let me know if
you will be able to attend.  Thanks!!  I'm looking forward to seeing everyone.
