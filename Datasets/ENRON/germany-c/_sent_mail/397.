We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco 
Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.  The deal number is 418282.  Could we 
put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet?
We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.  We need to call 
Bay State if we move it.


My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.  I gave Stacey Angie's 
number as a contact.  If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to 
Robin.
