Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.
