Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis?

Chris--The attached spreadsheet contains our Daily volume requirements for 3/7
and 3/8 (except for the AGL numbers).   For 3/7 you will see two 'NOM'
Columns--one labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of
the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be
identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers
differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where
there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the
'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being
withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month
baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume.

Please call if you have questions, etc.
