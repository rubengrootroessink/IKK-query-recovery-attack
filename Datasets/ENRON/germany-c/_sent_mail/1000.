We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed.

How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys
looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this
option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my
guess)?

Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if
reduce, we
may not get any $ back.

Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?
