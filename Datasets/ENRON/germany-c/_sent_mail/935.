The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and 
the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I 
added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the 
volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from 
all other deals.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Subject: July Volume Request for C&I customers behind COH


Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.
