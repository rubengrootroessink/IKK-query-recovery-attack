Brenda - All that is coming through to settlements on this is a demand 
charge.  I have actualized
receipts and deliveries, and in "offered services" it says billing basis is 
on delivery, which it should be,
except on mcf's not dth's, but it's still not coming through to settlements.  
What do I need to do?   Let 
me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118
