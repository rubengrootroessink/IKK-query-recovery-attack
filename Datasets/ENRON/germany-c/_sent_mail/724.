I'm all over it.  I have 2 plane tickets, one for Monday evening, the 18th, 
at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning,  19th, at 6:45am.  Knowing what a 
wonderfull morning person you are, I will probably leave Monday evening.

AND I will be in town next weekend.  Who is giving you a pool party??

Just hope you hadn't flaked out yet.

How was East/West Texas this past weekend?? I bet it was extremely hot.

I got the okay on bringing the cat up here!!! Only $250 cat deposit.

If you are in town next Sunday, September 10th. We are having a BBQ, "going
away" thing at my pool around 4 pm. I do need you to come by before we leave
on Friday, September 15th... to get a packing strategy... I think I'm good
to go... but since you have more experience at this... I'll take your
advice.

Thanks.
