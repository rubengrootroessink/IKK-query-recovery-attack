That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will 
be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and 
pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last 
day of the month.

DPL has issued an OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I will need
to adjust my volumes as follows:

23rd - cut volume of 1203 to 883 dth on TGT K# 6057

24th - cut volume of 1203 to 823 dth on TGT K# 6057

Effective the 25th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day.

DPL may revise the OFO - in the event of a revision, Marianne Stiles is aware
of the changes that need to be made.  I will be out of the office Wed.
afternoon and all day Friday.
