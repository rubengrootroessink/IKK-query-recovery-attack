Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.
