I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract.  
We have so many.  Do you have a Sitara deal number?

Please see below and advise on the effective date for contract #1000103 or
should this contract not be used for January business?
Thanks,

Sylvia

ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract 96034155 on the third 
party pipe for January business.  This contract is set up with an effective 
date of 02/01/2000 rather than 01/01/2000 in the Global Contracts system.  Is 
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we 
not have used this contract for January business?

Thanks for your help.

Cathy
