Subject: Tetco Invoice - March

Invoice # 000300389
Contract # 892722
TETCO invoiced for demand of $2211.86.  Deal # 207137 did not have a demand 
fee so I added it per the invoice.
If we should really not have a demand fee and pipe invoiced in error, please 
let me know.
This contract is on the CES Retail spreadsheet for March but has zero 
estimated.

Invoice #000300094

Contract 892069
TETCO invoiced for demand of $117.79.  I don't think that there's a deal in 
Sitara. The contract is on CES spreadsheet with zero estimate and contract # 
is in Old contract column.  
Contract 892066
TETCO invoiced for demand of $3,382.59. No deal in Sitara: on CES spreadsheet 
with zero estimate.
Contract  892084
TETCO invoiced for demand of $280.62. No deal in Sitara: on CES spreadsheet 
with zero estimate.
Contract  892085
TETCO invoiced for demand of $3,108.20. No deal in Sitara: on CES spreadsheet 
with zero estimate.
Contract  892590
TETCO invoiced for demand of $506.38 No deal in Sitara: Not on CES 
spreadsheet .

If these are valid contracts and charges, please add deals in Sitara before 
April 19th so invoice can be paid.

Thanks,
Brenda
