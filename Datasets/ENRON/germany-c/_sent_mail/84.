Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.  Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.

Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I use?

I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting old.
