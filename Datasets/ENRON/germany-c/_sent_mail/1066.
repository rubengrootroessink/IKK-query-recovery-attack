I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for 
Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.

We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm 
taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000

That's all for now.

I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new 
demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not 
subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.
