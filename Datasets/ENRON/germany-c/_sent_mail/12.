Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax number and I'll send it to you.

Thanks for your help

I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I asked her to call me back.

Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.

Thanks
Laurie

No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess (formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email is jbieltz@hess.com.  Thanks for your help.

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.
