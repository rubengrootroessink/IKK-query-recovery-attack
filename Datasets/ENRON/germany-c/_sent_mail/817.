>resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
>boss,
>and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."

>  A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
>together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
>both
>companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
>retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
>millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades'
>high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make
>it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
