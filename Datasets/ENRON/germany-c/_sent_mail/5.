Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston.

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan
