What time did you call?  I was playing on the computer about 9:30 on.  I 
didn't get any capacity either!  Turkeys!

I tried calling you last night but your phone just kept ringing.

AND, John Kinder called me this morning and told me I didn't get my 
capacity.  He said the winter goes for max rate and I bid $.16, but the 
goober would not give me a good feel for what it went for.
