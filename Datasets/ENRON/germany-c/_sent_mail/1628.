One correction:  It is our understanding that we will nominate this contract 
until March 2000, not until the fuel management responsibilities expire in 
2002, unless we are successful in negotiating an extension of the ENA/CES 
Retail alliance beyond March 2000.

To ensure everyone is on the same page. International Paper/Union Camp 
contract expires with CES Retail to perform the Fuel Management Duties in 
2002. Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities 
from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing 
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term 
supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires 
at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to 
nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.

The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency 
rights for the International Paper Contract. 

Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract 
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and 
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo 
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this 
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.

In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required 
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can 
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting 
this matter resolved ASAP.

Thanks
