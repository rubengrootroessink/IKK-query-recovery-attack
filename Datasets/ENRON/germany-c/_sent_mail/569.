I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
