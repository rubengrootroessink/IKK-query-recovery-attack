As per my conversation with Chris Germany on Friday, 04/28, we these volumes 
are only being billed under FirstEnergy.  Please make appropriate changes in 
Sitara.

Let me know if you need further information.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Can you make sure that we aren't doubling a deal with Belden.  If not we will 
pay them 2.649.

Thanks,

David

Belden sold their Marketing company to FirstEnergy.  My sale to Belden for 
2,500/day TZ4 @ $2.649/Dth was part of that sale to FirstEnergy.

John,

Can you please help with this deal.  The original CES information shows a 
purchase from equitable and a sale to Belden at the price of 2.649.  Has 
First Energy bought Belden, or is the First Energy deal different.

Thanks,

David
