I will be in Port Aranasas Friday morning.  I should be back in Houston by 2:00 PM and I will have my cell phone turned on for the trip home.  I don't have voicemail on my cell phone.  But, if anything should happen, you could leave me a voicemail at home and I will check it once every hour after 1:00 PM on Friday.

Before I forget here  is my cell phone number 303-667-3495.  I hope it works there.  Do you  still have one?  I will pick up my luggage and be at the passenger  pick-up.  If you have a cell phone I can call you whether it is my cell  phone or from a pay phone.  
 
See you  Friday!
