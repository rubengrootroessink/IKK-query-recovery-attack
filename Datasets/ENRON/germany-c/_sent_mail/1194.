Subject: 1st annual House Party

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to 
hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a 
party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official 
party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty 
simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to 
drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk 
to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people 
don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.  

If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I 
may have left off the list.


Hope to see you all Saturday,

Matt


Directions:

Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going 
east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third 
stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip 
mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).  Travel on 90 for 
1.8 miles until you dead end.  This will take you to CR 101, which you will 
take a left on.  Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and 
take a left.  My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you 
turn onto Kennedy.  3606 Kennedy Drive   281-692-9255
