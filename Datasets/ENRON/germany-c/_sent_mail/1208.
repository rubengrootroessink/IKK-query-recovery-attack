Can you help with this Dayton issue?  This is the one we discussed where 
Dayton is saying there is a fixed price and we have it in the system at 
index.  Can I get a list of all Dayton sales for CES so I can try to match 
them up?

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided 
us with incorrect data, or if Dayton is wrong and this really is an index 
deal.
Thanks for your help.

This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000



ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29


145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

Thank you for your assistance.
