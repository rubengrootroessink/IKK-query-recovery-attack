This is a CES deal. I do not know who is confirming the pricing for the CES 
deals. I would reccomend maybe getting with Chris Germany. Please let me know 
if you need something else.

It looks like we have a price discrapency on deal 231760 for April 
production.  Columbia Natural Resources has invoiced ENA  at $3.02 and we 
have the deal priced at $2.14.  Could you please check with the trader and 
confirm which price is correct.  


Thanks
