Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.  The FSS balance is 797,464 and 
the ISS balance is (797,771).  This is better.  We need to pay back another 
307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.  I know you guys 
will make me proud.

I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have 
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of 
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we 
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling 
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks
