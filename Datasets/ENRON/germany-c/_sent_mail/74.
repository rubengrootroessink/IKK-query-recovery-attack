Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??
