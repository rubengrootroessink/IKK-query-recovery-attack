Add the demand to the commodity, that's comes out to $.0505, there is your 
nickle.  However, being that we work for a marketing company and recognize 
the value of fuel, we take that into consideration.  The pipelines don't 
usually.

Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.  The start date is the 27th.  Currently 
there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).  The min 
demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.  The commodity 
is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00.
