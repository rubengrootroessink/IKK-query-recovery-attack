Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management 
group.

I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If 
it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the 
transport.

Subject: TCO Capacity


Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?
