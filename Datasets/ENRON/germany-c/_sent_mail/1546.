Done.  Deal 210603

I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her 
voodoo stuff, this deal will show up.

Ms.  Franklin, this might be my last contract to set up (he he he <=== evil 
snicker!).

Hey Chris, CES/CNR Contract 515. Can you set this up just like the other CNR 
contracts that you have set up in the past.. Please set up for Jan 1 start 
date. Deal # 77283 is a CNR contract that you can copy. If this is something 
you can get me to do, let me know. I have approximately 70 contracts that 
need to be set up very soon for CNR. Wade is starting to pay the Jan 
invoices. Thank you, Rob
