Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your 
records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery 
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be 
somewhere around $16.00.
