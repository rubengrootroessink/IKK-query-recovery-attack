Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a 
better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume 
that's ok.

This is just a reminder that there is a confidentiality agreement between ENA 
and CES regarding the retail business that prohibits ENA wholesale from 
discussing any aspect of the CES Retail business with EES.  If you receive 
any calls from EES people about the CES retail business, please inform them 
of this prohibition on discussions. If we receive consent from CEG/Nisource 
at some point in time, I will let you know.  Thank you.

I have confirmed after talking with Jeff Hodge that ENA and EES cannot 
discuss anything regarding the CES retail business.  Both the CA and the 
Retail Agreement have sections that explicity mention that  ENA has to keep 
information confidential.   I talked with Jeff Golden, who is working on the 
EES side and mentioned that there can be no discussions between EES and ENA 
regarding the CES Retail business without first gaining the written consent 
of Nisource/CEG.

Jeff - If I have misstated anything, please let me know.

Patrick
