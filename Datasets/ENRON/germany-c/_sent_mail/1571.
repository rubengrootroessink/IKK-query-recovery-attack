The portfolio we have created is "East - Service Deals - No Contract" and can 
be opened up in Deal Manager to view the storage deals on the East desk that 
have no contract.  Since we just created the porftolio, you will have to 
click on the blue refresh arrow icon located in the Open dialogue box in Deal 
Manager.  This will refresh the list of portfolios you can open and include 
the one we just created.  If you have any questions, please call me at x35423.
