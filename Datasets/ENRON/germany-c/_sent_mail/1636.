Brian with CES just called me and asked if we could take the cut at 
Colonial?  Let me know.

Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 
volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy 
North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  

Please let me know how you sourced the gas.
