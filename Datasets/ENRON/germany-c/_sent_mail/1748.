FYI - You may already be aware of this but I'm passing this on in case you 
didn't know this.

Storage deals require a meter on both the injection side and the withdrawal 
side in order to bridge - even if there is only a demand charge.
A zone is not enough, it must have a meter.  Let me know if that works.

The deal was entered on friday 1/7,  and your right it never bridged over to 
Unify.  I don't understand the location question,
the deal was set up like all other storage tickets.  I'm just trying to get 
the demand to download so VM can draft it.
