We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us 
anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from 
CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom.  
We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS 
contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to chat 
with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why is the pipeline set up as CGAS 
and what exactly do you mean by doing the noms via CGAS?  Does that mean that 
we turn the noms into CGAS who then gives them to KO?  It's been a long time 
since I scheduled CGAS and KO, but I remember that when I had a KO nomination 
I use to fax KO a paper nom directly and we use to put everything into 
autonoms under the KO matrix and not the CGAS matrix.  What makes this 
different?  Just curious.....

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??
