My techy's going to help me buy a computer.  I'm thinking of buying a Dell 
Pent III 600 Mhz with a bunch of other stuff I know nothing about and an 
HP8?? color printer.  I was also going to buy a digital camera and start 
taking a lot more family photo's and save them to disk.  What do you think?

I was also going to try and create a home page and keep track of the stuff I 
plan on doing.  1st up is Hang Gliding the first weekend in March.  I have 
not registered yet.  Cool huh?  Time for my free meal  :o)

SEE YA!
