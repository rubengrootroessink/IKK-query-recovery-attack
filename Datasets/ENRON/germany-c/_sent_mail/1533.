Scott misspelled your name.  I hope I have the right guy.

I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is 
pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the 
pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I 
spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.

Thanks

I talked with Hunter.  Kevin Rosetti is the man.  Chris, please bring up to 
speed on how to handle CES.

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.


Comments?
