Chris, 

I sent a check to KO Transmission for Monday, 7/20 for $71.19.  This amount 
covers 2/00 - 5/00 production.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??
