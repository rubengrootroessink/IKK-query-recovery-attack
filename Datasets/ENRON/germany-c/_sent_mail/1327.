>  After having met you, I've changed my mind."
>  *"I must admit, you brought Religion in my life.  I never believed in
Hell
>  until I met you."
>  *"Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help but
>  wonder: What the fuck was I thinking?"
>  *"As the days go by, I think of how lucky I am that you're not here to
ruin

>  *"Congratulations on your new bundle of joy.
