Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 
11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale?
I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct?

Subject: CGAS k#62039  

Contract 62039 was replace with contract 65402.  It's 20,000 day with a 
primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH.  The term is 11/1/99 
- 10/31/2000.  Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this 
belong to wholesale??  Also, I'm showing a demand charge of $.15.
