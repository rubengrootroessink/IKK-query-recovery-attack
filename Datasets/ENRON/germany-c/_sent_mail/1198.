According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 
activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned 
about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on 
the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?

thanks
