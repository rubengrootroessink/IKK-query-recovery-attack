Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of 
invoices at one time?

I think we were sending you all of the invoices and you were going to review 
for confidentiality and then forward to CES.  So I take it you haven't 
received them?  Sherry -- what's the status on this?

Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000.  My contact, 
Brian Perrone, said he has not seen them.
