1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.

2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith 
as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those 
3 people.

Chris,

1-  According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I 
+0.014.  However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.  
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2-  On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal 
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.  
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned 
physical.  Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES 
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Vivien:  I have spoken with the EES scheduler on two CNGP deals and on the 
40,281 volume (Sabine 702US) - this is a term deal that has always been 
IF+.014.  It appears that ENA has changed the adder.  Please check as to why 
this rate has changed.

Also on the CNGP deal where we (EES) has 186,180 at 3.406 - this is a 
financial deal that was turned physical.  You may need to check with a Chris 
Germany on both of these deals.  ENA doesn't even have this 186,180 entered.

Let me know.

THX
Patricia
