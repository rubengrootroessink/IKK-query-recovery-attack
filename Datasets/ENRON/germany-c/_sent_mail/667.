Trip was busy but productive - got more free food.  I didn't get home until 
10:15pm Tuesday.  I'm still tuckered.

Give Muffy a hug for me.

Thanks again for your help in getting Muffy and Joni to Bethesda safely.
Muffy is doing fine... she wants to go outside.

I'm meeting with my Realator that knows this area. I'll probably not do the
Annapolis thing.... everybody says you have to add another 1/2 hour for
traffic... so it would be 90 minutes. I'm also looking for apartments close
by. I got my current apartment extended until Nov 17th.

I'm almost done putting everything away... so my place is almost like home.

How was your trip???
