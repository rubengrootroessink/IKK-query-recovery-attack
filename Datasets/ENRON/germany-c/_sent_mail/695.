I'm glad you like your gifts.  I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I 
took up sewing (for Hector) and metal working type stuff for your goodies.  
I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.  I'm out Friday, Monday, 
and Tuesday.  

AND I've been putting photo's on the web.  I bought a digital camera.  Take a 
look .  Go to ==>  http://www.cartogra.com/home/home.asp
Then go to the box in the bottom right side of the screen where it says "new 
to cartogra?".  Enter my account name "trogg522" in the space beneath and 
click on the arrow.

Later :o)

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii
