We are still together.  But you just wait, there is still time, especially since I went to church twice yesterday and she didn't want to go at all.  She's a heathen like you.

Have you an your Woman broke up yet.  Normally takes about 2 days after dinner
with us.  Man the meal and company was excellent.  I enjoyed myself greatly.
Especially after you picked up the tab.

Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.
Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.

Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it
out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I
use?

I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting
old.
