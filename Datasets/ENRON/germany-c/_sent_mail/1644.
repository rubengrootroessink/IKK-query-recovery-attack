and Feb.  Here is how it works.

Rate Comment
$.2855 1.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Waddington to Canjahorie
$.004 2.  Flow gas through our parking contract at Canajoharie
$.4727 3.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Canajoharie to Brookfield
$.004 4.  Flow gas through parking at Brookfield
$.2409 5.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Brookfield to S Commack.


The total cost is about $1.00.  I will follow up with the exact cost later.
