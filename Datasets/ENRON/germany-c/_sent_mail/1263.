I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.  I'm working 
fast and furious on March.  I was going to do most of April next week with 
Molly.  Can I give it to you then?

Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you 
are ok with that.  Just let me know.  I also mentioned the intra day storage 
change to Dick Jenkins.  I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the 
storage.  For now, I will allow the intra day changes.
