Chris,
Global Contracts does reflect Hunt Petroleum (without CES).  Stephanie Sever
in Deal Validation needs to have the name changed in Deal Manager.

that someone in Global?

The contract for Hunt Petroleum has been assigned from CES to Enron.  I need 
someone to change the names on deals 136863, 135898 and 136845 from CES-Hunt 
Petroleum to Hunt Petroleum (without CES).  All of the deals are on the East 
desk.  Let me know if this request is to go to one of you or if I need to 
forward this to someone else.

Thanks,
Megan
