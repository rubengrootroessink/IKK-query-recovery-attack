Colleen has signed the letter and it has been FedX for arrival at TCO 
tomorrow.

Susan Wade is presently upset that we are using Team 3 and not her  Team. She 
overheard Chris Germany talking to Steve Stonestreet today. She overheard 
Cindy Burnette working on Union Camp for me yesterday. We need someone from 
Enron to smooth this over with her.

Please decide who will be giving Susan Wade the courtesy call about the 
change. Not sure what timing is best... today or tomorrow.

Thank you.
