Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti.  His 
phone number is 713-853-6320.

I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek 
numbers (with Scott Goodell as my backup).  I will forward the bid week 
numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers.  
After bidweek, you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and 
myself for all East Desk issues.

Let me know if you have any comments or questions.
