August 12th is open for rafting.  The Royle Gorge section will be low,
so we do not have to rent wetsuits.  But, you can if you want to.  The
price is $86.89/person.  If we get 12 or more people it's $78.20/person.


I have not heard from all of you yet, so please let me know if you are
interested.  Mary is looking into the camp site.

I'll send another e-mail soon with updates.  :-)

Jen
