This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received 
the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.

Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie 
because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is 
going on.

Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give 
Mark a copy.

Thanks.
