I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss 
our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th 
holiday.  

I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.
