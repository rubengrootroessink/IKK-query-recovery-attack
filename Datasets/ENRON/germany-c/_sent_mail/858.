It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the 
system.

Chris,

Do you know if all this gas was simply turned around and sold to CES?  And do 
you know if we have made any progress on getting these deals into the system?

FYI - John Singer wants us to pay this based on volume he is providing in a 
spreadsheet.  To do thatm, Gloria will have to put this in Unify, and won't 
have true pipe support.  Are you comfortable with that?

Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price? 
John
