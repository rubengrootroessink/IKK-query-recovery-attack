Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059.  We did 
this exact setup on several contracts today.

Chris,
Will you have the same contract # and the same Pipeline under Market East
and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos.
and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise.

Subject: Capacity Deal tickets

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.


Comments/questions?
