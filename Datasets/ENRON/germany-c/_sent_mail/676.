AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks
