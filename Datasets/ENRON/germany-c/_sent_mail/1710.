Deal 150348.  I have it in Sitara as  833 day for the 15th-31st.  This deal 
is secondary recallable, which means the gas don't flow if secondary 
transport gets cut.

That's when the deal was done apparently.  I don't care when I get the gas as
long as it's before the month's over.  I guess you didn't know about it??
