I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove 
Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up 
on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America 
now has 3 storage contracts.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the 
counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.  
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
counterparty.
