Re:     Market Area IT Availability  May 1, 2001

The available interruptible transportation service (IT and
secondary FT) on Transco for pipeline day Tuesday, May 1,
2001 and continuing until further notice is summarized as
follows:

Tier I and Tier II (only Sta. 90 through
Sta. 180 affected)                                      0 MDt/day

South Virginia Lateral Compressor Station 167           144 MDt/day

Tier III (Station 180 through East)                     0 MDt/day

Leidy at Centerville Regulator Station
(Only deliveries downstream of Centerville
regulator affected)                                     OPEN

Linden Regulator Station
(Located in Union County, New Jersey)                   50 MDt/day

Mobile Bay Lateral                                      162 MDt/day

As a result of unscheduled maintenance at Station 90 the packages will
be reduced as stated above.  This maintenance is expected to last 4-5
days.  Customers will be notified of a change in the availability of
interruptible capacity at Station 90 and Station 180 as soon as
possible.

The above available interruptible transportation service
refers to deliveries into the affected area that have
receipts upstream of the bottleneck or affected area.

If you have any questions, please call John McGrath at (713)
