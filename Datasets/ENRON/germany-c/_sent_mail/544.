CGAS storage looks good.  We are still working on the ohters.  I should have 
a better feel by tomorrow afternoon.

Chris,

I just  got off the phone with Rich Contos, he wants me to find out if Enron
concurs with the storage volumes sold.  I think Ernie Simien or Doug Kinney 
had
sent some volumes and associated dollar amounts to you to look at.

Let me know if Enron is in concurrance.

Phone is 713-267-4646 and you can see the e-mail address.

Thanks,

The Donald
