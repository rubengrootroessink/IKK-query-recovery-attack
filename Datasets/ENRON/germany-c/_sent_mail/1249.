Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

Comments/questions?
