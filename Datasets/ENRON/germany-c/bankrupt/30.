Subject:=09Form of Presentation to the BTRC

Chip,

As you are aware, I met with Bob Semple this morning regarding the presenta=
tions being made before the BTRC.  Bob is of the view that these presentati=
ons are often too long and detailed for the entire BTRC audience and that t=
he presentation style/format should be modified slightly.  We agreed on the=
 following:  (1) the old presentations (which were generally several pages =
in length and contained more detailed information) should continue to be pr=
epared, (2) an "executive summary" should be prepared (on a single page) as=
 a cover sheet to the "old style" presentation, (3) the executive summary s=
hould be limited to the proposed transaction, associated economics and othe=
r highly pertinent information (such as ownership, debtor vs. non-debtor, t=
hird party liabilities, etc.) and (4) the actual presentation at the BTRC m=
eeting should be limited to the items reflected on the executive summary an=
d although the "old style" presentations should be distributed to BTRC part=
icipants (under cover of the executive summary), the information contained =
therein should not be discussed or referred to unless questions arise durin=
g the BTRC meeting that justify doing so.

If any of this is unclear (or if you have a principled objection to making =
this change), please give me a call.

Thanks

Stuart
