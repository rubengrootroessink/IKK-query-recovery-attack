Chris:

I think it would make sense to add these deals into your system but I don't think it is a timing issue. It is the matter of cash inflows and outflows.  Specifically, I don't want to be in the same predicament that we (the project) were in. I need the ability to receive payments directly to Ponderosa Pine and I also need the ability to send payments directly from the Ponderosa Pine account. By doing these two activities, I can monitor and approve the inflows/outflows of cash. By example - the recent TXU wire for February 2002 sales that was almost wired to Enron.  Cash outflows - the Williams payment by Enron in November 2001 that has no FED ID# or breakdown of accounts.

Donna, I did the noms for the 1st but I think I would like you guys to take over.  Robin is going to handle this while I'm out and she won't be doing the nominations.

Mike, Rick,  this activity is currently being handled outside our normal gas systems (Sitara and Unify).  I would like to get our gas systems set up to handle this activity as opposed to doing everything manually like we are now.  I spoke briefly with Scott Mills yesterday and he agrees with me that it should be in the system.  Do you have any idea how long this activity will be around?

Thanks
