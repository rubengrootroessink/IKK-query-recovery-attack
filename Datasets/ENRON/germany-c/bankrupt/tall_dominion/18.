I keep track of Tallahassee's swing volumes in this worksheet ==>  o:gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/city of tallahassee/tallahassee swing cash flow.xls, tab "actual gas flows".

FYI - if I recall Tallahassee is supposed to take a minimum of 35% of the swing gas.  Through May 2, 2002, Tallahassee has called on 126,695 dth (52%) which is greater than the minimum requirement.

Jared Kaiser at UBS said we should speak with Roger McDonald at Tallahassee and that Pam McCullers (my contact) would be able to give us his number.

I just left a voicemail for Pam McCullers  - asking for Roger's phone number and title.
