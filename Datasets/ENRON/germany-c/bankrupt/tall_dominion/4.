Ed, 

There was an outage on MOPS in Feb 2002 that impacted how much gas ENA received from Dominion (Louis Dreyfus deal #30468).  We paid Dominion for 100,000 dth and we invoiced Tallahassee for 100,000 dth.   After the month was over, we discovered that we actually received 104,793 dth.  We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it.  Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562].  Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].

If yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.

Per David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.  Using my calculation down below, we paid Dominion (and billed Tallahassee) for 100,000 dth.  I would like to verify that Tallahassee received 104,793 dth, then bill Tallahassee for the additional 4,793 dth and pay Dominion for the same amount.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
thx

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.
