Here is the update on the supply for City of Tallahassee:

Christina Sanchez spoke with BP Amoco who is supplying Dominion the gas the Dominion is selling to ENA.  They told her the pipeline believes at the earliest maintenance will be done by Friday.  Christina has contacted Pam McCullers at City of Tall to let her know.  Reliant is still supplying the swing piece with the expectation of the 9th and 10th.  City of Tall did not mention the interruptions to Christina.  Chris has been buying this gas on a weekly basis with a prepayment of $20,000.00 a week.  I also told Christina to follow up with Pam to make sure they have received the Force Majeure letter.
