Shemin,

Please review and approve at your convenience.  I modified the document that was fully vetted for the financial gas auction for use in this auction.  We are planning on sending these Monday.

Let me know if there is any problems.

FYI, looking forward, we will need to start work on the PSA and Assignment docs.

Mike Bridges
