Gentlemen,

	Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow,
June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas
to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire
month of June.  Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract
for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement.  In any case,
Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so
that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives. 

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Roger McDonald
