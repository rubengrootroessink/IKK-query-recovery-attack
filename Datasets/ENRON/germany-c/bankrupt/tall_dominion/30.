i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

>                    Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc
(successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth
per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to
The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I
prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion
was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying
any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson
Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.
