	sold city of tall 2000 for 5/15 at egan.  
	reliant is going to serve at egan.  the gas didn't flow for today's gas day.

	spoke with mike @ white pine.  he indicated that the plant is burning 44 to 45 MM/d and would 
	throughout the summer.  we are going to sell 10MM/d until he tells us otherwise.

	sold the gas to lyn at txu.. the price for 5/14 is $3.26.  the price for 5/15 is waha gas daily minus $0.05.
	she said they are swimming in gas and the only way she could buy it for tomorrow is at waha minus $0.05.
