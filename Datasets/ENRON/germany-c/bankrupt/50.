	i'm going to be out of the office tomorrow.  i'm still working on curing mcv for the month of march.  i will make sure chris is up to speed on the status
	of the curing process at the end of today.  here's where i stand as of 1:15pm today.  i spoked with tom moran regarding purchasing gas from anadarko and
	mid american.  he says both counterparties are ok.  i have checked with kay mann to make sure that mid american is still ok legally.  she saids 
	there has been no change with them in the last month.  i am planning on buying from mid american because the wire information is in place.  also,
	since we bought from them last month,  the scheduling contacts are in place.  i am waiting on doug sewell to give me the green light.  it is my
	intent to purchase the gas this afternoon and make the cash request.
