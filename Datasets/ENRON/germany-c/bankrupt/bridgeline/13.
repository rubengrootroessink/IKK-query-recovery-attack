Paul Darmitzel called Christy Finelli, our gisb attorney, regarding the gisb agreement that Oxy emailed me.  Christy is out of the office today.  I spoke with her on her cell phone.  She said just before we declared bankruptcy she had negotiated a gisb agreement with Oxy.  She's optimistic that they can get a contract in place quickly.  She would like to wait until Monday to work on it.  I told her that would be OK.  I am assuming that we are not in a position to sell Oxy gas today.  

If necessary I could attempt to make a sale contingent on credit and a executed agreement.

If you want me to attempt to sell gas to Oxy today, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks

Robin
