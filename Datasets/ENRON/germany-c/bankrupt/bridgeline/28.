Chris,

I got a call this morning from Bill Geist from Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  He is interested in ENA's agency, transport, storage and fuel management agreements.  I told him that we may be looking for a buyer of our Bridgeline inventory.  He was interested.  Call him at 402-758-6195.  He may also be interested in picking up the contracts also.

In the past the following folks have also expressed an interest in storage/inventory in the Gulf Coast.  The numbers are on our contact list.

Cook Inlet
Cinergy
CMS Energy Trading
Dominion
Marathon
Oneok
Sempra
Western Gas Resources
TXU

Be sure to ask them if there is any interest in picking up the storage contract and firm transport agreements.  I would tell them that both are discounted from the maximum tariff rates.

Ruth
