FYI.  This is the formal response we received from Bridgeline yesterday.  In the event Bridgeline does not agree to purchase the gas, what delivery point on Bridgeline is best for us to use under FT if we were to bleed out the inventory over 30 days and what price could we get?

We appreciate your support on this.

Thanks.

Chip

Attached is a letter from Randy Curry faxed to me yesterday afternoon outlining the initial proposal made by Bridgeline in our meeting yesterday.  Bridgeline is not formally offering to purchase the gas, however, in a subsequent voice mail from Randy, such a purchase is not out of the question.

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review.  I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal.  Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive.  Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

Before then, I may be calling around to get people's views on a response.

Thanks,

Chip
