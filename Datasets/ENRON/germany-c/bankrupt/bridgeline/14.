I don't have any firm bids but I have the following information.  

In order for Sequent to purchase gas from us they require some sort of legal document showing that Enron has title to the gas.  She won't be able to purchase gas from us until next week.  Their notional bid for gas at the hub is Nymex - $0.03.  

I received Oxy's gisb contract this afternoon and have forwarded it on to legal for review and comments.  I ask for a notional quote this afternoon.  My contact had told me he would have a notional quote this afternoon.  However, he has been in meetings since 2:00.  I will call back tomorrow.  They have inquired if they could by the gas in the ground and manage the transportation agreement so they would have the daily flexibility.  I told them I didn't think that was possible but I would check.  I also told him that we could possibly offer some daily flexibility with a daily deadline.

That's today's news.

We are serious, but we can't commit yet--we have to work out issues with B/L.  We think we can work those out over the next week.

Have they indicated any price range of pricing?
