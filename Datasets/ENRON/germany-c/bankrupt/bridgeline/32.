Ruth, Christina said she was scheduling Bridgeline when Bridgeline stopped accepting our noms.  She said some gas did flow for December but she doesn't think there will be any hard evidence of Bridgeline not accepting our noms.

Donna, do you agree with my comment above?  Can you get any documents showing ENA nominating gas on Bridgeline and Bridgeline not accepting those nominations?
