Chip,

Doug Wilkinson, Controller over at Bridgeline, has confirmed that Bridgeline shows the following balances:

Bridgeline Storage	Firm Storage Agreement	1,930,552 Dth	K# 96034600
Bridgeline Holdings	Firm Transport Imbalance	18,159 Dth due ENA	K# 96034592
Bridgeline Holdings	Interruptible Transport Imbalance  6,212 Dth due ENA	K# 96034796

ENA's accounting records have been reconciled to within a total of 21 Dth of these balances.  We need to write off this small volume discrepancy.

Please make the necessary changes to the settlement letter to address these reconciled volumes.

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth Concannon
713-853-1667

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Ruth
