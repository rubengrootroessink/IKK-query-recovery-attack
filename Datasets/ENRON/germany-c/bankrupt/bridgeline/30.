Bridgeline is nominated via EDI from Unify.

According to our scheduled quantity logs, it looks as if a zero volume was nominated to Bridgeline companies after 12/3.   On 12/3, its obvious that ENA originally nominated gas and a zero quantity was confirmed.  On the second cycle, the original on-time nominated volumes were reduced to zero, re-nominated and confirmed as zero.  It would be a logical guess that Bridgeline told us to reduce our noms to zero....   The only way to determine if Bridgeline TOLD us to cut our nom., would be to pull tapes (if Christina had a recorded line)....

According to the Scheduled quantity log, the following was scheduled and confirmed in December 2001 on Bridgeline Gas Distribution, LLC for ENA:
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/2
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/2
	Contract:			96034596
	Rec Pt:				0840025
	Del Pt:				0840473
	Volume:			27,500 dth

On 12/3, it looks as if the same volume was originally nominated on time; then the receipt volume was reduced to zero on an intra-day basis; according to the scheduled quantity log, the delivered volume was not cut...this seems a little weird??;  Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December.

For Bridgeline Holdings, LP. :
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/3
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/3
	Contract:			96034592
	Rec Pt:				0843019
	Del Pt:				0848704 & 0847719
	Total Volume:			105,950	 dth (12/1);  106,137 dth (12/2);  106,136 dth (12/3)

Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December


For Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC:
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/3
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/3
	Contract:  			96034600

	Del Pt:				0843060
	Total Volume:			105,950 dth (12/1); 106,137 dth (12/2);   106,136 dth (12/3)

Ruth, Christina said she was scheduling Bridgeline when Bridgeline stopped accepting our noms.  She said some gas did flow for December but she doesn't think there will be any hard evidence of Bridgeline not accepting our noms.

Donna, do you agree with my comment above?  Can you get any documents showing ENA nominating gas on Bridgeline and Bridgeline not accepting those nominations?
