At the bottom of the attached file is a list of possible prospects for the Bridgeline gas.  Chris and I are still calling counterparties and updating the spreadsheet.  Thus far there are no firm bids for the gas but several "I'm interested and I will investigate the possibility."   We will keep you updated.
