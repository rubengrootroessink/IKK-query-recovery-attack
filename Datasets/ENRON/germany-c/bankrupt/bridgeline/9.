Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.
