Our last physical volumes from Wiser was March 2000.
Our last physical volumes from Riceland was July 2001.

KLJ is a producer on Gatherco which flows into Columbia Gas.  Our last month to receive gas from KLJ was November 2001.  We don't know if they have sent Enron a termination letter or not but I do have a deal with KLJ in Sitara (#250668) that goes through Oct 31, 2002.



Wade Price notes:
Germany, Chris says:
k.l.j., Inc is a gather co supplier, do you know if they have terminated their contract with us?
Price, Wade R. says:
I don't know that we received a termination notice from KLJ in the Settlements shop.  No gas was allocated for KLJ from Gatherco from Dec-01 forward.  Riceland has nothing in Unify since July-01 and Wiser has notheing since May-00.
Germany, Chris says:
cool, so all 3 of these are Appalachian producers then correct?
Price, Wade R. says:
KLJ-yes.  Riceland - No (ANR pipe), Wiser - on CGAS (Mar-00 not May), but production was 139000dth, more than a normal appalachian metered production.

These physical CPs show up as live.  However myself and others are not aware of any activity with these CPs.  Please investigate.  (Any gas taken or delivered?  Last month of activity? Etc.)
