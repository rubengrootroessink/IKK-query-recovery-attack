I kind of doubt that you'll get any changes since both of the wells have changed in just the last two days, but here's the scoop.

There are only two wells to worry about getting calls from.  

1)  West Cam 310/313 (Hios) you may here from Elma with Forest regarding a change.  She called today with a change for the 7th to go from 3795 to 3700.  I'm going to go ahead and let Steve Lewis at Petrocom know, so you shouldn't have to worry about it unless she calls back.  I did however, give your number to her.  Her number is 337-265-2622.

2)  EI 57 (Trco) you may hear from Janine with Samedan.  She just just her volume for today's flow, so I doubt that you'll get any new changes.  The current flow is at 1400.  Janine's number is 580-221-1200.  

If you get a call regarding either well, just call Steve Lewis with Petrcom and let him know.  His number is 713-353-2752.  He's very nice and easy to work with.  I also always follow up with an email.  His email is shl@ptrcom.com.  

That should be all that would need immediate assistance.  If anyone should need me though, my home phone is 281-361-2334 and cell is 713-304-1327.

Thanks!
