Not in my file. I'll have to look in some boxes.

I have the same for Gatherco - spreadsheet files from their website, and some of the invoices (I gave copies of invoices to Mark McClure I think).

Thanks for the invoices and the Tidelanders Chorus info.

You gave me Feb and Mar 2002.  Do you have the Dec 2001 and Jan 2002 invoices?
