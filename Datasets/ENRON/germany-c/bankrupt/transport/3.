Because the names of the 2 pipeline tracking spreadsheets were so similar and somewhat confusing, I changed the name of one of them.

The spreadsheet that lists the pipelines and the numerical status of the pipeline is now named "Pipeline Status Summary" - (formerly Pipeline Contact List) - it is still located in the transportation directory.

The file that contains the detailed contract information by pipeline is still named "Pipeline Contract List"


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Maria
