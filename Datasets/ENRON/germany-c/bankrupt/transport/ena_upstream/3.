Ok, I found my Tennessee ID and password.  I've tested it out and it appears to be still working.  

ID - 001076B
Password - plant
Domain - tgpl

Please let me know if you need me to do anything regarding the ENA Upstream storage on Tennessee.  I'm fairly aware of the situation since I was the one was the one who had argued with Tennessee back in October over the balance, as well as made the original sale to Sequent.

Thanks, 

Kathy

Chris is looking for an ENA Upstream ID on Tennessee.  Do you know of one and if it is still active?
