Attached below you will find the master file that I use to keep on ENA Upstream contracts.  In one of the columns on the left you will find my ID's and passwords to the various bulletin boards.  Other than Tennesse, I'm not sure how many of these are still active.

Let me know if you need any help regarding ENA Upstream questions.
