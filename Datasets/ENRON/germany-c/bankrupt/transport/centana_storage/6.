Duke Energy Field Services has provided a copy of all the referenced agreements to me.  The only problem is that not one agreement has been executed by Centana (aka CIPCO) or ENA.  During my last conversation with Greg Swidensky at Duke, Greg said they needed to know whether ENA was going to keep the contracts or not.  This leads me to believe that Centana thinks that the agreements are active whether executed or not.  What's your legal opinion?  

Once again, I believe that the rates under these deals look pretty good and there may be some interest by third-parties in picking up these contracts.
