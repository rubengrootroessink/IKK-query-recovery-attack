Priscilla was asking me if we ever paid for the Centanna storage that we sold to Duke Energy Field Services, LP.

I see that deal 1203368 was entered in Sitara on April 1, 2002 by Joe Parks.  The deal is a sale of 1,006,885 dth to Duke Energy Field Services at $3.13 on 3/30/02.  This is showing up in A/R as an outstanding receivable and Priscilla is wondering if the cash may be sitting in another account or different Duke entity.

Any ideas?
