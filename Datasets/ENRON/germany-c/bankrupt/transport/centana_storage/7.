Donna, 

The sale of  ENA's storage on Centana Interstate P/L, LLC needs to be scheduled and pathed in the system.  The deal number for the sale is 1203368 and the storage contract is 400030.  The deal of course has been pushed over from Sitara but the other processes still need to be done.  I was not sure who to send this to in your group,so I am forwarding this to you.  

Wade - As soon as I hear back from Donna once this is complete, I can go in and actualize the volumes so that you can draft the sale.
