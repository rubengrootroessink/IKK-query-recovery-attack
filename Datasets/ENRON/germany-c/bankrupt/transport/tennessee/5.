I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston
Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz
Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the
demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so
familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing
back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.

Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably
not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and
knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like
Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not
pay the invoice.
