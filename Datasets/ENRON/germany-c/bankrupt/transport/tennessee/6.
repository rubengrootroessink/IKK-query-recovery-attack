Since our meeting on Tuesday, we completed additional research on the invoi=
ces from the pipeline.  I have attached a spreadsheet that provides summari=
es of the invoiced amounts and details of the cash out charges for gas and =
penalties.  Also attached is a few pages of the pipeline tariff that addres=
ses the required process for the pipeline to collect demand/reservation fee=
s from the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, if the Replacement Shi=
ppers, ENA and EES, do not make on-time payments. =20

SUMMARY

For the capacity release contracts, it appears that Tennessee  is using the=
 bankruptcy filing to satisfy their tariff requirements of issuing non-paym=
ent notice, and termination notice due to non-payment that are required bef=
ore the pipeline can bill the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, for=
 the reservation charges that were not paid by ENA and EES.  I have not bee=
n able to find any other letters sent to Enron from Tennessee regarding non=
-payment.  See attached Sheet No. 337A, 338, 355, 356 and 405.
The Boston Gas capacity release deal appears to be the largest $ amount of =
Tennessee's claim.  For November and December, $374,500.00 of the claim is =
associated with the reservation fees of Boston Gas' contract.  For January,=
 $373,660.00 is the reservation fee.  The remaining portion of the bills ar=
e commodity and commodity surcharge expenses.  For the months of February a=
nd March, ENA posted a capacity release transaction on the pipeline EBB.  E=
ach month, the deal was posted at 100% maximum rate transaction with Boston=
 Gas as the pre-arranged party.  Therefore there should not be a continuing=
 for those months.  At Boston Gas' request, both postings specified that th=
e releases were subject to bid. =20
Tennessee's listing of contracts in the bankruptcy filing excludes the five=
 contracts designated as "ENA Agent-Nomination and Billing".  This makes se=
nse in that ENA was just a middle-man and transportation charges were being=
 passed through to the customer.  Tennessee must be billing the customers d=
irectly!
For the Cash Out and Level Charges (i.e. penalties), there are two summarie=
s that describe the information that you requested.  I believe that it is i=
mportant to distinguish between current and prior month.  Current month imb=
alance numbers are usually tracked by the pipeline and are available to shi=
ppers with a couple of day lag time.  Prior month imbalances are made by th=
e pipeline when accounting problems and issues result in reallocations of s=
hipper volumes.  For example, in the Dec 2001 invoice dated 1/14/2002 for E=
NA's K# 80045, current month imbalance was 34,266 Dth due the pipeline or $=
92,323.29.  Since gas was due the pipeline, a Level Charge or $38,997.33 wa=
s also due the pipeline.  Prior month cash outs of 134,869 Dth or $887,821.=
20 due ENA also appeared in the same bill.  This adjustment covered the mon=
ths of Oct 2000 through April 2001.  Another prior period adjustment will p=
robably be made by the pipeline for May 2001 through December 2001 time per=
iod.  Please note that the Average $/Unit price is a simple average and not=
 what is shown as the cash out gas price on the invoice.
For ENA, the storage agreement was used post-petition so that the storage i=
nventory could be withdrawn.  It is my understanding that ENA has not paid =
the invoices yet.  There may be an issue whether or not the discounted rate=
 was in effect for the last month that withdrawals took place.  ENA is wait=
ing to see what the billed rate is before a payment is made to the pipeline=
.
EES's LMSMA balancing agreement is tied to serving one of EES's former cust=
omers.  The pipeline has expressed an interest in retroactively transferrin=
g this agreement and obligations over to the new supplier.  We are still tr=
ying to get additional information on the timing from EES.
As you can tell from the summary, there is some miscellaneous charges that =
have popped up.  One is clearly designated as a Late Payment Charge.  The o=
thers could probably fall into a similar category.


We have tried to summarize the facts.  I will leave it up to you to decide =
whether the amounts are prepetition or post petition.
