Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a global Enron bankruptcy filing.  We have checked the information that EES provided earlier to Maria and there was no retail contracts on Tennessee Gas Pipeline shown.  Tennessee shows the following six active contracts with Enron Energy Services, Inc.  Please provide some additional clarification including the following information so that Enron can decide how to best respond to the filing.

Supply Aggregation Service Agreement K# 80265 (SA)


INFORMATION REQUIRED

Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it?
Did EES nominate under the agreements since November 30, 2001?  If so, provide nomination by day.
Does EES need to retain the contract?
How much pre-petition and post-petition claims are due to Tennessee?
Are there any contract imbalances remaining that need resolution?
For transport assignments, can contract be re-released back to NYSEG?
Can EES provide a copy of the contract, capacity posting and back-up information for the bankruptcy files?

As always, there is a short turnaround time to complete Enron's response to the filing.

Please respond by Monday, March 4th.

Thanks,
