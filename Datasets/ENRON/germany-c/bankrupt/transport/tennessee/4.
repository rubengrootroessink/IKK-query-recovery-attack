Ruth, =20

Per Patricia Sanchez with Tennessee, ENA Upstream has a balance of 36,171 o=
n the IT storage contract 37011.   Patricia has given us the ok to sell thi=
s gas at any time. =20

This balance had been over looked because in the month of Oct. I had sold m=
y remaining storage balance of 400,000 to Sequent who was pulling the gas p=
rorate ably throughout the month.  When we reached the final week, I was co=
ntacted by Patricia that we were 36,000 short in our storage account.  Afte=
r much research at the time, Tennessee informed me that the beginning balan=
ce in October had been adjusted due to a PMA made to September's business. =
 At that time, I went into the market bought the additional gas to fulfill =
my obligation to Sequent.  However, after some reconciliation, Tennessee ha=
s discovered that only the reversal of the original entry was booked in Oct=
. and that the rebooking was made in November's business, thus resulting in=
 the additional gas in storage.  Basically, the PMA was the result of a req=
uest I had made for them to move a withdrawal transaction from an IT agreem=
ent to an overrun contract which I had a special discount on, thus saving E=
NA Upstream quite a bit of money. =20

If you need to speak to Patricia, she can be reached at 832-627-2617.  Plea=
se let me know if you would like me to do anything further with this.

Thanks,

Kathy
