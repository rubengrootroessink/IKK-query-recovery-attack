Shemin,

I was reading in today's Gas Daily that FERC Chairman, Pat Wood, had an "open-mind" about extending the temporary waiver of ceilings on capacity release transactions past September 30, 2002.  The article also said that this is a different position than his earlier stance.  It also said that one of the Commissioners did not favor an extension because of the potential to contribute to price swings for gas.
