Motions
>
> We just found out that National Fuel Gas Supply, NFGS, filed motions with
the bankruptcy court on December 18, 2001 to (1) vacate the automatic stay
and allow NFGS to terminate the firm and interruptible transport
agreements, (2) compel the Debtor to assume or reject the agreements, or
(3) provide adequate assurance of future performance by the Debtor.  A
separate motion for ENA and EES was filed.  The hearing looks like it was
scheduled on January 3, 2002.
>
> I do not believe that ENA's and EES's commercial groups were aware that
these NFGS's motions had been made to the court.  Was Legal involved in a
response to these motions?  If ENA and EES did not respond at the court
hearing, is the decision of the court to terminate the agreements?
>
> Most of the agreements were for interruptible services that had no future
value to the Estate.  One of the two firm ENA agreements was tied to a
"producer netback" transaction that Enron Canada is working on a settlement
with the producer.  The other firm ENA agreement is out-of-the-money and
would have been rejected anyway.
>
> Please confirm that by ENA and EES taking no action at the hearing that
the agreements have been terminated.  I will get with Enron Canada so that
fact can be included in their settlement with the producer.
>
> Thanks for your help,
