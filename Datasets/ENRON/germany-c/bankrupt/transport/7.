Hey guys...

The file is now saved as a shared file. All the changes discussed in the meeting have been done.

The file is located O:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/Pipeline contact List

If you have any questions or problems with the file, let me know.

FYI...the breakout of the pipelines turned out pretty equitable.
	Chris 	17
	Robin	23
	Ruth	21
	Maria 	21

Robin/Chris - I will show you the format that I have been using to track the individual information for each pipeline after lunch. We can work on reformatting it, making changes or scrapping it and creating a new format - whatever works for the team.


Maria
