Here is a draft diagram that lays out my proposed Transportation Contract Evaluation Process.  I have tried to show the entire span of transportation and pipeline services contracts and how the decision-making would be completed.  Of course, the interruptible agreements would only be rejected/terminated after it was determined that they were no longer needed for commercial purposes.

Please view this diagram as a supplement to the Administrative Protocols that Mark Ellenberg is finishing up.  

What is the next step in getting this issue in front of the committee?

Ruth
