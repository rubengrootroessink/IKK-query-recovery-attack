Transport Team

It appears that in our efforts to collect information from the pipelines we are duplicating some efforts. 

Rita Wynne's team is also actively collecting and reviewing pipeline invoice information. She has suggested that we coordinate with her team to more efficiently gather the information and keep the pipelines from getting bombarded with requests. The pipelines have been assigned to specific people in her group.

We should continue to contact the pipelines and request a list of their active agreements, inform them of our intentions to work with them and let them know that someone in our group is in the process of confirming outstanding invoice information with them as well  and would appreciate their cooperation. We should then work directly with our internal contact to determine the status of the invoice claims.

Rita will need a prioritized list of the pipelines. We can get together as a group and decide on the best way to prioritize the list.  I will provide her with the same list that PW will get - "Pipeline Status Summary" so that she can get a feel on were we stand with each pipeline. She will also have access to the detailed contract list were we are tracking the dollar amounts for each agreement.

Thanks
Maria
