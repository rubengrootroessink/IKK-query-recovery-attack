I received confirmation from Steve Van Hooser (attorney) that we are not to pay for post petition transportation if we did not use it.

No, unless the capacity is capacity that is 'in the money" and we want to keep it going forward.  However, please get with Ruth Concannon and Steve Van Hooser to confirm not paying.
Regards,
Ed

Ed,
We received invoices for MRT transport for DEC 01. We did not use this transport to deliver to keeper markets. Do we pay this bill?? I am assuming we don't but wanted to verify with you.
