Kinder Morgan has wired ENA $34,978.01,  They also provided backup information that the payment was for Trailblazer post petition receivables + interest, and it was the net amount of the following items:

Post Petition A/R Items + Interest:

	$84,296.30	ProRated Demand (December 3-31)
	$90,578.56	Demand (January 1-31)
     ($33,465.04)	Demand (February 1-28) + Capacity Release Revenue (February 7-28)
    ($176,387.83)	Demand (March 1-31) +  Capacity Release Revenue (March 1-31)

Supposedly, TBPL has also sent Ed M. or Ruth a letter describing how things are going to be handled going forward.  Neither Ed or I received the letter so I am asking that TBPL send it again.  By now, ENA should have also received a wire for April business for about $176,000.

Since there is normally a payment lag, I recommend that TBPL immediately pay us $174,874.86 + interest that has been frozen by TBPL for the December and January post petition amounts.  If the court comes back and agrees with TBPL's agruments, then TBPL makes an adjustment on the next invoice to ENA.  It is about the same amount of money.

I talked to Philip Bentley, Trailblazer's counsel, today.  I told him that
Enron would not even consider the possibility of exploring settlement
unless Trailblazer turned over the proceeds of the capacity release that it
has been holding.   He said that he would relay that to his client.

Bentley left a message for me tonight.  His message said that he had spoken
to his contact at Trailblazer and that "coincidentally" Trailblazer either
just has or is about to wire the final payment to Enron.  Bentley said that
this was in keeping with "Trailblazer's practice of wiring portions of the
payments as they came in the door."  He said Enron should either already
have the payment or should be getting it soon.  He said that this appears
to eliminate the issue I raised with him today.  He said that the "ball is
back in our court."  He asked me to relay to Enron that this was no longer
an issue and let him know whether there is any interest in exploring
settlement.
