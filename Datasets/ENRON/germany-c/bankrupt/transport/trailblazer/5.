Thanks for your help in drafting a payment demand letter to Trailblazer.  

According to my contact at TBPL, Andy Edling, TBPL does not send a separate check to pay shippers for any excess credits that appear on an invoice.  The excess credits, with interest, are just rolled forward to offset future invoiced amounts.  Since ENA will be receiving more than our contract rate through September 2002 business from our capacity release deal, the letter should address the partial month capacity release deals for February 7-28, and the capacity release deal done for March through September 2002.  

Here are the specifics:

1)  Address the letter to Andy Edling, Account Director, Trailblazer Pipeline Company
	One Allen Center
	500  Dallas Street
	Suite 1000
	Houston, Texas  77002

2)  TBPL's invoice shows that $33,465.04 should be paid to us for February.  I recommend the letter say that for the February 7-28 capacity releases, a total payment of $52,706.62 to ENA should be due from TBPL.  This ignores the first 6 days of demand payments in February and the prior period interest charges that should be covered in the bankruptcy process.

3)  For March 2002 through September 2002, a monthly payment of over $177,000 per month should be paid to ENA.  It may be better to generally ask for the credit to be paid, rather than stipulate an amount for each of the months.

4)  Have Ed McMichael sign the letter.

5)  cc:  Mark Kissel

I will fax you the invoice.

Thanks,
Ruth
