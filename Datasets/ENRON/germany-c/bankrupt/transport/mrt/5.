Shemin,

I got the information you requested so that you could revise MRT's permanent release instruction letter.  Time may be of the essence on Monday morning.  Assuming we get the official word on approval from the Creditor Committee early Monday morning, we will need to be in a position to send the revised letter back to MRT late Monday morning.  Basically I begged them to give us until Monday afternoon before the Motion is filed.

Here is the information:

K# 416		Enron Energy Marketing Company
		Termination Date of 10/31/2004
		577 Dth/day MDQ
		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate
		Evergreen and ROFR Rights

K# 434		Enron Energy Services
		Termination Date of 15/31/2004
		3,583 Dth/day MDQ
		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate
		Evergreen and ROFR Rights

MRT has found three counter-parties willing to step into EES's and EEM's contract obligations via permanent capacity releases.  They are National Steel; Village of Dupo, Illinois; and City of Waterloo, Illinois.

With respect to K # 416 and the unusual Enron counter-party name.  EES purchased PG&E Energy Services gas book several years ago.  This MRT transportation contract was a part of that gas book of transactions.  It is probably because of this acquisition that a different EES counter-party was used.  MRT confirms that this contract has a counter=party name of Enron Energy Marketing Company (Duns #941565582).

An effective date of April 1, 2002 for the permanent releases is still everyone's goal.

Thanks,
