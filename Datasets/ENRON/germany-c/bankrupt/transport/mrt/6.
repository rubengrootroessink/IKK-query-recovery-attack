Shemin,

Here is a draft instruction letter that MRT prepared in anticipation of hearing that everything was approved by the Creditor's Committee.  I will double check the contract numbers and entity names this afternoon and will let you know if they don't match up with the letter.  Also, we will need to change the date of the letter and put it on EES/EEM or Enron Corp. letterhead.

Thanks for your help and keep your fingers crossed that the Committee says yes,
Ruth
