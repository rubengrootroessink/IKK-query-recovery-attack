Bill agreed to provide us this information during the Dominion conference call.  I think we knew most of this, except that another penalty refund is going to need to be addressed.

Shemin, I forgot to flag the language in one of the Asset Management sale agreements that we just copied that talks about waiver of claims and who needs to pay in the future.  Sorry.  This agreement may change the VNG refund decision that we talked about a few days ago.

Ruth

Ruth the refunds for EES and ENA are involved with FERC Docket No.
RP00-632-007.   DTI made three filings: an original and two corrective
filings.   Also DTI is preparing to distribute penalties collected during
last year and Enron will participate in getting more "refunds" under that
distribution report.  I understand the amount will be less than $100 as I
understand.
