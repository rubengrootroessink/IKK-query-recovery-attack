Pat,

As we discussed this morning, I need your help in getting copies of EES agreements related to retail efforts behind several NY LDC's.  The LDC's in question are Niagara Mohawk (aka NiMo), NYSEG (aka New York State Gas & Electric), and Rochester Gas & Electric (aka RG&E).  The agreements I am looking for are the master contracts that EES may have signed with the LDC's that addressed the release of upstream transportation and storage capacity with interstate pipelines (e.g. Dominion, Columbia Gas, Tennessee, etc.), operational balancing agreements that covered swing supplies, and the transfer of existing LDC storage volumes on the upstream pipelines.

We are using this information to get ready for a Bankruptcy Court Hearing that is coming up in a couple of weeks.  

Thanks for moving this one to the top of the list,

Ruth
