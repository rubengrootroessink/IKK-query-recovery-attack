Ed Smith (who works with Mark) spoke with Dominion's counsel this
morning.  He said that Dominion will provide the
documents and information we requested by the end of the week.  Dominion
has also consented to a further "2 or 3 week" adjournment.

Hopefully, this will get the ball rolling and Chris can lead our effort
to obtain a commercial resolution.
