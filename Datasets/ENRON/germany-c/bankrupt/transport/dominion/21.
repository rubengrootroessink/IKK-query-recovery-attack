Ed Smith and I spoke with the other bankruptcy counsel from Lowenstein,
named Andrew Pincus as I recall. As to the 4/16 hearing date, he was 99%
certain that they would agree to move the date back.  He said that he
and Mickey have been focused on another proceeding, but they will call
us tomorrow and they believe that Dominion is eager to move forward and
discuss the issues.

I will let you know what happens during that call. At the moment, no
time has been set for the call.

Have a good evening.
