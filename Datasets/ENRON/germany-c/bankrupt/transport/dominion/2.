Shemin,
 
Maria has been working on reviewing the rate refund calculations for DTI.  She has a few questions that I cannot answer.  Is it OK to call Bill Saviers and see if we can talk with one of their folks about how the refund is calculated?

Bill agreed to provide us this information during the Dominion conference call.  I think we knew most of this, except that another penalty refund is going to need to be addressed.

Shemin, I forgot to flag the language in one of the Asset Management sale agreements that we just copied that talks about waiver of claims and who needs to pay in the future.  Sorry.  This agreement may change the VNG refund decision that we talked about a few days ago.

Ruth the refunds for EES and ENA are involved with FERC Docket No. 
RP00-632-007.   DTI made three filings: an original and two corrective 
filings.   Also DTI is preparing to distribute penalties collected during 
last year and Enron will participate in getting more "refunds" under that 
distribution report.  I understand the amount will be less than $100 as I 
understand.
