Here is the information that I requested from EES accounting on the value of the Dominion storage using the weighted average cost of gas approach.  I am sure that I will be able to you to come around to my view of what NiMo's SC-11 tariff says.

I will also try to get documentation that confirms that when the storage volumes were assigned to EES that the wieghted average cost of gas approach was also used.  EES believes that the market value of the NiMo storage volumes were significantly higher than the invoice price that was paid.

Ruth:  Attached is the worksheet from accounting showing the estimated value of our DTI (formily CNG) storage to be $4.36 Dth and a balance of 667,925 Dth.  If you have any questions or need additional information please let me know.  Thanks!  md

Here is a copy of the worksheet. The months of March and April reflect injections, however, these are not true injections, only me adjusting the balances to reflect the most recent statements. Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thanks.

Hi Marde, 

You said that you were able to locate another storage contract for CNGP, do you know the contract number? Was it contract number 531267? If you could let me know so that I can include those totals in the worksheet.

These are the contract numbers that I have:

		NIMO - 531275
		NYSEG - 531280
		RGE - 531263

Thanks.
