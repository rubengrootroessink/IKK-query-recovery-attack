Hi Chris,
Welcome back! The word is that we are trying to get a commitment from
Dominion as to when they are going to provide the information we
requested and we are asking them for a second extension of the hearing
date. We have called their lawyer at least once a day for the last few
days but have been unable to reach him. I will keep you both posted and
talk with you this afternoon.
Too bad you missed the waffles.

Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's
office
last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for
awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with
Dominion?
What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer
on
that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House
smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were
"covered"
with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

   Ruth,
   Have you spoken with Chris? He has been leading the Dominion team
from a
   commercial perspective and has been coordinating with EES.
