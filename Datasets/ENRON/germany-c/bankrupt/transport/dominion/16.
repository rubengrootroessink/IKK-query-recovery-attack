I'm pretty sure I'll be in tomorrow but this is what I've seen in the
Dominion package.

Summary:
No information on the large storage contract or where that balance is being
tracked on Dominion's system.  Maybe the large contract expired 11/30/01 and
Dominion only provided info on firm contracts effective after 12/2/01.  EES
had a smaller storage contract from NYSEG with a total capacity of 21,000
that did not expire until 3/31/02.  No information on the storage balance
for this contract either.

Producers
Dominion provide summary statements for production gas allocated to EES and
ENA with the last month being Feb 2002.  Strange thing is that in November,
Dominion terminated all the contracts where the balances are currently being
tracked for both ENA and EES (ENA contracts 8G001N, 8G001S, and 8T001S) (EES
contracts 8G310N, 8G310S, and 8T310S).

Per the Imbalance Statement for EES, the accumulated imbalances for all 3
contracts is (4809) as of Feb 2002.  The imblance was (2110)  as of Nov
2001.  So it appears that Dominion had allocated some gas out of EES's pools
prior to 12/2/2001.

Per the Imbalance Statement for ENA, the accumulated imbalances for all 3
contracts is 21,167 as of Feb 2002.  The imblance was (19747)  as of Nov
2001.

Important note:  if ENA agrees to pay the remaining producers left in the
pool, ENA would probably only be able to sell the current Feb 2002 balance
of 21,167 dth which means we would be paying Dominion back 19,747 of
imbalance gas.
