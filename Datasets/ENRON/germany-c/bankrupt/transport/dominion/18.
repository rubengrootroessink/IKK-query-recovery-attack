Just wanted to let you know that we did not hear from or receive any
information from Dominion last Fridayas we had expected. Most recently,
Ed Smith and I called both of the bankruptcy attorneys representing
Dominion and left messages for but neither of us has received a return
phone call. Ed and I will continue to try to make progress with
Dominion.
