Here is a copy of the worksheet. The months of March and April reflect injections, however, these are not true injections, only me adjusting the balances to reflect the most recent statements. Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thanks.

Hi Marde, 

You said that you were able to locate another storage contract for CNGP, do you know the contract number? Was it contract number 531267? If you could let me know so that I can include those totals in the worksheet.

These are the contract numbers that I have:

		NIMO - 531275
		NYSEG - 531280
		RGE - 531263

Thanks.
