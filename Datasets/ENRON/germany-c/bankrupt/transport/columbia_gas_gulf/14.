Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Vickie
