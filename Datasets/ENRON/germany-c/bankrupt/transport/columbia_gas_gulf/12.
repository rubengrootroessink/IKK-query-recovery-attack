Chris,
Is this some of the space that EES wants to keep on TCO?

Ruth:
Rhonda Smith received a telephone call from Greg Williams regarding an asset which is still tied to Enron Energy Services. NYSEG released storage (contract # 65116) and pipeline capacity (contract # 71412) which are mandatory assets tied to supporting the retail markets behind NYSEG. These assets have not been released by Enron Energy Services and thus could be make us liable to post-petition damages and claims. The storage volume of 13056 dth must be resolved by March 31, 2002 as the amount will be liquidated by the pipe. NYSEG is no longer a market being supported by EES but I would like to take advantage of the high current market prices. 

This brings up another question....has any of the EES capacity been released back to the pipe, especially those assets which are currently not being used to support 'keeper' markets? Please contact me regarding the status of this progress and what needs to happen to expedite resolution to paragraph one. 
Thanks for your help!
