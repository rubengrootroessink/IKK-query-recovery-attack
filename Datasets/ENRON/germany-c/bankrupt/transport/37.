Ed, Attached is a list of the Central transport agreements for review. We are not keeping any of the LDC's they deliver to and the transport has no value in the marketplace(not in the money).

Joe,  Thanks for the heads up.  We need to get information from you and others regarding EES capacity so we can compile the list to assume and cure post-petition claims or reject and terminate/release.  We have already initiated this effort for EES and need to move to completion this week.

Chris, Maria, Kelli - Please gather the information we already have and plan on getting together at 11:00 AM today to discuss.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Don,
I was contacted by Mike Stoll with MRT Pipeline regarding our FirmTransport Agreements. We have 2 agreements of 3583/day ending 5/31/04 and 577/day ending 10/31/04 totaling 4160/day delivering to LeClede. This LDC is not on the Top ten list and we are incurring demand charges daily. They offered to take back the transport at max rate which is what we paid. I don't think it is something of value and we should go ahead and release it back to them. They will draft up the paperwork and send to me for review. What do you want to do?
Thanks,
Joe
