I need your help to make sure that the P&L/cash estimates get updated to record the February and March capacity release revenue that ENA will be receiving from Transwestern under K#24942 (i.e. Ignacio to Blanco I/B Link).  It is my understanding that Kim will be flashing the expense at our contract rate of $0.06/Dth, therefore the demand expense that should be flashed is $42,000 for February and $46,500 for March.  TW released the capacity at the maximum rate of $0.102/Dth for February and March.  TW will keep $0.021/Dth or 50% of the amount above ENA's discounted rate (i.e. $14,700 for February and $16,275 for March).  To offset ENA's demand expenses of $0.06/Dth, the invoice will also show a credit of $0.081/Dth or $56,700 for February and $62,775 for March.  TW will be paying the difference to ENA (i.e. $14,700 on March 15th and $16,275 on April 15th).  

Chris -- Please put new Sitara tickets in the system to record ENA's capacity release credit for February and March

Maria --  It looks like TW K# 24924 can be released, either moon-to-month or permanently, above our discounted rate.  This contract needs to be on ENA's list of contracts to keep and remarket for the estate.  TW Accounting has told me that for February and March the payments to ENA will be made on the 15th of the month.

Phil --  Set this contract up as one that ENA wants to keep.  Update your cash flow model to record the TW payments on March 15th and April 15th.

Thanks for your help,

Ruth
