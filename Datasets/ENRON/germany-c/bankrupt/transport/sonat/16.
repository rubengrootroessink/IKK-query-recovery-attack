Hey Chris,

Invoice indicates that the PAL Contract number is PAL1001 for both.
Deal 1424 is the one that shows a negative (96,000) balance and Deal 1222 indicates a 266,241 balance.

Kelli's spreadsheet indicates that 8588 was sold a day Jan 1-Jan 8, 2002. This sell needs to be verified as well as the price it was sold for. If this sell is correct, the new balance would be 197,537?

Like I mentioned before, Kelli indicates that a letter was received that indicates that the 96,000 was withheld for PAL and 101,437 was withheld until payment received. I do not have a copy of the letter, but it would be helpful to know who in legal is working on this.

Ed needs to know the status of the storage and the action plan(s) to move into liquidation. Let me know.

Thanks for you help. 

Maria
