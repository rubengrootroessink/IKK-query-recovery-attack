see the below response to my request that the sonat gas be released.  we
should pay charges associated with the gas up to the point that they
refused to release it.  can you tie to their numbers?

Dear Mark:

I received your voicemail concerning the parked gas and have discussed the
matter with our client.

It is our understanding that Enron owes Southern Natural Gas at least
$72,000 in parking charges under the relevant agreement for this parked
gas.  This is separate and distinct from any other amounts owed to Southern
Natural Gas under any other agreements.  It would seem appropriate that
Enron pay the amounts owed in respect of the parked gas.

We would be happy to discuss this with you, of course.
