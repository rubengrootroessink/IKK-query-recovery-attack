I am sort of getting the run around on whether or not the rejection/assumption decisions need to be presented to the BTRC if the decisions were already part of a signed Stiputation.  I got on the BTRC agenda for tomorrow's meeting, but Deb Korkmas seems to think that BTRC approval is not required.  I have left a message with Chip Schneider just to make sure that we have to make a presentation.

This is making me crazy,
Ruth
