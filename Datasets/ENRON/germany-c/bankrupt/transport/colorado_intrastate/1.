Here is another motion.  Maybe we can get them to agree in using the transportation protocol process as a solution.

P.S.  Is this pipeline one of mine?

Subject:	New Motion 5/23 and the Milbank DQ opinion

The following was filed today:

1.	Colorado Interstate Gas Company, LTD.

Motion for Entry of an Order (1) Modifying the Automatic Stay to Permit Termination of Contracts or, In the Alternative (2) Compelling Debtors to Assume or Reject Agreements

Debtor: ENA

Deadline: June 10, 2002  
Hearing: June 13, 2002

Summary:
This is yet another motion by a pipeline to terminate its contracts with ENA or compel the assumption or rejection of the contracts.  The arguments are substantially the same as those made by other pipelines.  We were informed by Colorado's counsel (who is the counsel of record on other pipeline capacity motions) that this motion was forthcoming.


And for those who are interested, attached is a copy of the bankruptcy court's bench opinion on the Milbank disqualification motion.  The motion was denied.
