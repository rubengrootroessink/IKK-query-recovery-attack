Chris,

It was great to get to talk with you!  Sounds like things are going well
with the baby.  I sure can't wait to see her!!!

Attached is a list of the contracts I was talking about.  Please let us know
if we can terminate these prior to 1Line data conversion.  We would need a
letter from you to initiate the termination.


Thanks,

Suzie
