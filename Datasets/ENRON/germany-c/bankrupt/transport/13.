Phil,

For the MichCon storage payment that is to be paid on 3/25, please change the note and delete that the payment request is still pending.  I gave my stuff to Doug on Thursday night and Rita was finishing up the wiring form last night.  

For the $5313 payment for the Bear Creek storage et. al. that is shown to be paid on 3/25, we need to delay the payment until we can resolve the pricing and volume questions with the pipeline.  I recommend that it be delayed until say 3/29.  There is a chance that the payment will be lower than $5313 once we get everything resolved.  Is there a problem if the payment is reduced right before it goes out the door?

Ruth
