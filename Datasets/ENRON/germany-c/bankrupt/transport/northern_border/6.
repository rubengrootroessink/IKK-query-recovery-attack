My preference is to resolve the NBPL issues.  Enron-Canada still needs some of the NBPL capacity permanently released to one of their producers with a another third-party designated as the agent for the contract.  Oxy and some other folks have approached me about picking up some of the ENA space.  

Please note that we were trying to get the transportation protocols approved by the Creditors Committee so that we could address (1) NBPL's insistence that the Creditor's approve everything and (2) the needs of the marketplace that once the capacity is awarded that it could be hedged without any additional Creditor approval.  I know that we are making progress on the drafts, but how quickly do you envision this issues being presented to the Creditor's Committee?

NBPL wants the capacity placed with new shippers for June 2002 business.  Ideally, this means that the new shippers should have the capacity released to them by Friday, May 24th.  This means that the capacity would have to be posted on NBPL's website by the morning of May 20th.  The schedule also assumes that the capacity release process is not stopped once it starts for Creditor's approval.

Kay, would it be OK if I called Eva and got a quick download on the results of the Tenaska complaint against NBPL that was filed with the FERC enforcement division?  Do I need to have a lawyer listen in when I make the call?

Kay,

	As you know the hearing on Northern Border's Motion to Compel ENA to Assume or Reject is set for next week, May 9.  Please advise if ENA desires to work towards the development of a stipulation so that we can resolve the Motion without further litigation.  

	Regards,

	Eva N. Neufeld
	Senior Counsel
