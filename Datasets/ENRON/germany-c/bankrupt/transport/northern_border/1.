Chris,

Do you know if we were in fact an agent for a third party on the NBPL tport=
 contract T1043F and T1055F?  I looked up these contracts in global and tha=
t's what it's telling me AND there are also TC tickets in Sitara with Ander=
son Exploration as the CP.  For November 2001, we show volumes scheduled in=
 the system, but they were not acutalized.   Soooooooo, I called the pipe t=
o get a statement so that I could.  According to them, these contracts belo=
ng to Numac Energy and we are not the listed agent per their records.  Thes=
e deals were only effective for 2 months, Nov. 2001 and Dec. 2001, so I kno=
w things could have changed during that time period because of the bankrupt=
cy.  We deliver gas from several of our own ENA contracts to these contract=
s, but if we were not their agent, then it makes sense that we have nothing=
 actualized in our system on their contracts.  The other thing that is a li=
ttle confusing is , are Anderson Exploration and Numac Energy one and the s=
ame?  Northern Border did not know.  Let me know what you think........


Thanks,
Rita
