Mark,

My reading of the 45 page settlement agreement, says that ENA agrees ... to release to Birchill "on a permanent basis on or before October 31, 2002".  This wording gives us more flexibility than just saying the Birchill transaction is not going to become effective until November 1, 2002.  It also matches up with Enron Canada's Birchill settlement which is how I discussed the issue with Eva.

I did a quick read of NBPL's Motion.  Although, there was not a Schedule A in the Motion, it looks like the base contract for ENA's Tenaska temporary capacity release will be included in NBPL's Schedule A.  Your comment to Len Parkins on the revision is on point.

Ruth

Thanks for the revisions.  We need the following additional changes:

   We need to see schedule A.
   One contract has been released to Tenaska until October 31, 2002.  That
   contract should not be rejected until after that date.
   The Burchill transaction is not going to become effective until November
   1, 2002.  We suggest that NB do temporary releases between now and then.
   Mitigation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 should include either
   payments actually received or the highest bid rejected in the event NB
   imposes a minimum bid that is not hit.

I understand that Ruth Concannon has discussed these issues with Eva.

Also, I have not yet heard from Brian Rosen.

Thanks.

Here is the revised stipulation for Northern Border and ENA.  There is a
clean and a redlined draft for review.

Thanks
