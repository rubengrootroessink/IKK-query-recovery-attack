Michael,

Here is the Northern Border Pipeline draft stipulation that ENA is planning to present to the BTRC.  It incorporates the flexibility and features that Enron Canada needs to complete settlements that are in the works with a couple of former netback producers, Birchill and Tenaska.  It also has backup disposition plans for ENA's Northern Border capacity in the event that the Enron Canada deals fall apart.  With respect to future claims, NBPL's posting of the capacity on their website is just another way to find creditworthy shippers that can step into ENA's shoes for the remaining terms of the firm max rate transport agreements.

Here is a clean and black-lined draft of the Stipulation we talked about  a
little while ago.  If this is ok, call me and I will sign this Stipulation
and have it delivered to you by courier, if need be.  Otherwise, I can sign
it, fax it to you and mail the original to you.

Let me know asap so that we can put this behind us.

You will take care of noticing  out  the matter of approving the
stipulationa and resolving the outstanding issues on Agreement T1060F for
two weeks from tomorrow.

Thanks

Lenny
