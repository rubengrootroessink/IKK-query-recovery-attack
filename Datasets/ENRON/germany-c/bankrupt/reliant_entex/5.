Please work w/ Margaret Dhont to determine whether any of these outstanding balances relate to the Entex/Reliant deal we wrapped up on Feb. 8, 2002.  

Thanks

Louis

I have attached the file of all outstanding accounts receivable we still have with Reliant Entex.  Some of this is fairly old and in some cases the cash received has just been put on account rather than applied to specific invoices.  The file shows an AR amount of $580,779.97.

 
Please let me know how you want to proceed on this.

Margaret

Margaret, please verify that we are now completely paid up by Entex on this transaction.  I need to know that this counterparty is paid in full before we negotiate a release document with them.

I know we received the inventory sale amount of $813,858.20 on 4/4/02 (or perhaps 4/3/02) and the remaining $230,118.09 on 4/18/02.  Are there any other outstanding items?

Please call if you have questions.

Have not received the wire as of Monday 4/15/02.  I haven't seen the wire
activity for today yet.  Has Reliant/Entex sent the wire?

   Thanks for checking.

   issues to bring the deal documentation to completion.
