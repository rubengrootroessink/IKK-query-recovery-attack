Enron North America Corp. and Boston Gas entered into an Agreement to
Assign Firm Transportation Capacity of Iroquois Gas Transmission and
Tennessee Gas Pipeline, dated as of November 12, 1997, as modified by a
stipulation dated January 29, 2002.  The Debtor neither filed a timely
motion to assume the Agreement, nor filed a notice of rejection of the
Agreement.  Consequently, the Agreement shall be deemed rejected as of May
25, 2002.

Mr. Fleck,


I write on behalf of my colleague Antonia Donohue.  You and her negotiated
a stipulation on or around May 15, 2002 between Enron and KeySpan Energy
Delivery-New England (Boston Gas) whereby Enron agreed to decide by May 25,
2002 whether to assume or reject an executory contract between Enron and
Boston Gas.  According to the stipulation, if Enron neither moved to assume
the contract or noticed its intention to reject the agreement by May 25,
2002, the contract would be deemed rejected.  It is my understanding that
Enron has not acted to assume or reject the Agreement within the agreed
upon time frame.   Please inform me whether this is correct.


Thanks,
Sharan Nirmul
