Chris,

I think that it makes more sense if we send out our form to you.  We have no
problem w/ the changes to force majeure, but most of the other issues raised
in the GISB will present problems for us.  Specifically, we are unable to
agree to TX law, any arbitration, as well as spot price method of damages.
Additionally, it is of key importance to us that we have an order in place
w/ the bankruptcy court permitting both the contract, including the
transactions, and for Sempra to close-out and terminate any transactions in
the event that Enron converts its case to a Chapter 7.  We would require the
GISB to have language referencing such an order.

I will ask our Contract Administration group to send this out today.  I will
not be in the office this afternoon and tomorrow, but if you want we can
discuss on Friday.
