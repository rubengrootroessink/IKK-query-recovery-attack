A couple of quick updates:

1. We are close to having our deal monitoring spreadsheet pulled together.  Kimberly Landry will coming to each of you to fill-in the appropriate info on your deals. This info will feed into the master EWS spreadsheet. This is intended to capture all assets (physical and contractual)  that are in the process of being sold or settled.  Only those deals that are active should be included.  Assets/contracts that are not in the process will not be included.

2.  Prior to anyone meeting with the BTRC regarding a potential transaction, Bob Semple (Zolfo/Copper's representative within EWS)  and Jim Fallon/Rich DiMichele MUST be consulted.  Additionally, it should go without saying that I should be familiar with those transactions going to the BTRC as well as the respective functional head Racicot-power/McMichael-gas/Zisman-assets (E&P is separate and should be managed through Melendrez). 

3. Any transitional services that we might require from UBS should be coordinated through Rich DiMichele in EWS.  Eddy Daniels has been appointed our sole point of contact within UBS.  All one-off inquires and requests into UBS should be eliminated.  Additionally, please remind all your employees that UBS is a separate company and is not entitled to any Enron related information.  There are reports of UBS employees calling Enron commercial people looking for information, copies of contracts, etc.  We are all prohibited from sharing any confidential information with anyone outside the company (UBS or others).

Thanks for your help and let me know if you all have any questions.
