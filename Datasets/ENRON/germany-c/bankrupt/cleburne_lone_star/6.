Thanks Robin.

I don't think Lonestar will be a problem, it is Williams. And yes, Williams is early!

	i called  and spoke with williams and i left a voice message for apache. i told both entities that we wanted 25MM and 20MM respectively.

	i'll check into the lonestar nom issue.  i never heard of a nom being due this early in the month.

	chris or i will get back in touch with you.  he is going to be in the office tomorrow.

Robin:

  Have the Ponderosa volumes on Williams and Apache been nominated for June, 2002  ?  

  We want to take the full volumes under each contract: 25,000 MMBtu - Williams and 20,000 MMBtu for Apache. 

Is there a nom due for Lonestar also??
