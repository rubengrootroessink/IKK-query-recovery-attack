Things should be back to normal on Friday.  You will be able to start
burning off your imbalance again on Saturday unless the line pressure is
too low.  It may take us a while to build the pressure back up on Line X
again.

Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday, the
10th.  I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if
possible.

   Thanks.
