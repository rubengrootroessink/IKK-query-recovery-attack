After I learned that Robin was preparing a summary to bring you up to speed=
 with where we are gas-wise w/PPEP, I offered to draft something that might=
 help put us all on the same page and allow her to work on other things imp=
ortant to your group.

PPEP owns a 263 MW plant located in Cleburne, TX.  The plant has three gas-=
related agreements that require daily management:  (1) a gas transportation=
 agreement w/Lone Star, (2) a gas supply agreement w/Apache (which is being=
 managed by Cinergy), and (3) a gas supply agreement w/Williams.  Prior to =
June 30, 2000, these agreements were administered under a service agreement=
 between PPEP (f/k/a Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd., or "TIVTP") and Tenas=
ka Gas Co.  Under that agreement, Tenaska Gas Co. ("TGC") provided scheduli=
ng services, reconciled gas activity to invoices, and bought and sold gas o=
n behalf of TIVTP.  As consideration for services provided, TGC received a =
per unit fee that (if the agreement were still in effect) would have amount=
ed to approximately $0.0513/Dth in 2002.  That fee is prevalent in the PPA =
as it relates to Brazos' gas purchase options and electric pricing after 20=
06, the year the gas supply agreements expire.

The TGC gas agreement was terminated on June 30, 2000 at which time Pondero=
sa Pine Energy, LLC ("PPE"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta Power Co., =
LLC ("DPC"), acquired all of the entities that own general partnership inte=
rests (90%) in TIVTP (whose name changed to PPEP one year later).  Just pri=
or to PPE's acquisition, ENA acquired the only limited partnership interest=
 (10%) from LG&E.  In conjunction with PPE's acquisition, ENA entered into =
two service agreements with PPE:  (1) a Consulting Services Agreement, unde=
r which either party receives cost plus 5% for services rendered (there has=
 been no business conducted under this agreement, and (2) a Corporate Servi=
ces Agreement, under which ENA is entitled to receive cost plus 5% for acco=
unting, tax, finance, legal, and HR services it provides to PPE.

PPE's purchase agreement provided for a transition of gas services to ENA o=
ver 90 days.  In conjunction with the transition, ENA and PPE developed (bu=
t never executed) a gas agency agreement under which the ENA Texas Desk pro=
vided services similar to those provided under the TGC gas service agreemen=
t.  Per Weil, course of performance is sufficient to consider that agreemen=
t binding as a "verbal arrangement".  Under that verbal arrangement, the EN=
A Texas Desk received a fee of $0.0400/Dth in 2001; by our calculations, th=
at fee has increased to $0.0406/Dth in 2002.  PPE is current through Novemb=
er 2001 on the payment of these fees.

In addition to the status of the PPE-ENA gas agency agreement, two issues w=
ere raised to a consciousness level shortly after the filing of our petitio=
n =20

In what appears to be related to the sale of HPL to AEP, payments that were=
 made by PPEP to ENA for further payment to Lone Star between April and Nov=
ember 2001 were never remitted by ENA to Lone Star.  In order to prevent th=
e Lone Star agreement from going into default, PPEP was forced to pay Lone =
Star directly (effectively causing PPEP to "double pay" its transportation =
costs for the period). =20

Revenue that was received by ENA for the resale of gas on behalf of PPEP (i=
.e., due to an electric production schedule that didn't utilize full contra=
ct entitlements) for the month of November was never remitted to PPEP.

Taken together, these two items create a $1.3 MM claim against ENA by PPEP.=
  Additionally, we learned shortly after the bankruptcy that the electric p=
roduction schedule had lead to the development of a large imbalance on the =
Lone Star pipeline.  Given ENA's limited capability to transact on physical=
 gas (and Lone Star's physical limitations), it has been difficult to work =
off this imbalance.  However, the fact that the plant is generally short ga=
s in summer production months (i.e., the plant utilizes approximately 48,00=
0 Dth/d at full production vs. its 45,000 Dth daily contract entitlements),=
 the imbalance should start to reverse this summer.  It's my understanding =
that the facility has fairly liberal balancing provisions w/Lone Star.

An invoice for gas agency services since the filing of the bankruptcy was p=
resented to PPE today.  Based on conversations that I had w/DPC earlier thi=
s year, we suspect (due to the limited capacity in which ENA can perform an=
d the claim described above) that PPE will decline to pay the invoice.  ENA=
, at DPC's request, developed an RFP to solicit bids for a new gas agency s=
ervice provider earlier this year.  While we have received no indications t=
hat the RFP has been issued, it is my understanding that DPC has had conver=
sations with one or more parties that may be willing to provide gas agency =
services.  While not crucial to ENA's decision-making, we have no way of kn=
owing how these conversations have progressed or if DPC is presently in a p=
osition to assume the role of gas portfolio manager. =20

However, this is deal falls into the "SPE category" by virtue of a total re=
turn swap between ENE and KBC bank, which loaned PPE 97% of the total funds=
 needed to acquire the entities that own general partnership interests in P=
PEP.  The total return swap was entered into contemporaneously with PPE's a=
cquisition in June 2000.  The total return swap agreement appears to be in =
default; ENE has not performed under that agreement since the bankruptcy fi=
ling.  Likewise, the KBC-PPE loan agreement also appears to be in default. =
 We are aware that DPC attempted to put its equity interests in PPE back to=
 KBC in December under the loan agreement, and that its exercise lead to th=
e filing of a lawsuit by KBC.  We are also aware that KBC and DPC are in di=
scussions concerning a resolution of their differences and a possible restr=
ucturing of the investment, but we have not (to date) been party to those d=
iscussions.  Lisa Bills is responsible for the total return swap and bank t=
he bank relationship on this deal.  She is presently developing a strategy =
document for dealing with this investment (which appears to the deal team t=
o be a net liability due to the current market for power plant investments =
and the relationship with Brazos). =20

Because the SPE status (and outright ownership of the limited partnership i=
nterest), we intend to continue in our collective service roles (i.e., rely=
ing on DPC for authorization of our decisions) until such time that the str=
ategy can be advanced through the approval process.   Lisa views DPC's reac=
tion to the gas agency service fee invoice to be a key part of this process=
.

I hope this helps...please let me know if you need more.
