i spoke with frank fields at williams about the make-up gas from June 4.  he ask where we needed it and i told him i would have to get back to him.  he said just have you call jeff (william's scheduler) about it tomorrow morning and they will buy the gas tomorrow for wed's gas day.

i am still following up with cinergy/apache regarding the make-up gas.  i'll let you know what happens.

chris talked with lyn at txu.  lyn says sid rich or oasis into lonestar would be good points.

thanks
robin
