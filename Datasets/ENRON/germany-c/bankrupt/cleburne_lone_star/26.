Chris,

Can you help Karen out here???

	1) Is there a TXU Settlements person we can talk to regarding this difference in payment??? 

	2) At one time, you were contemplating putting our deal into the "system". Did this happen and are invoices being generated 	from this system?? 

MM

Mike, on May 29, a deposit was made into the Chase account in the amount of $925,244.97.  Would this be the deposit from TXU for April's gas sales?  According to Chris's schedule, they owed us $952,055 for April.  Any thoughts or comments?

Thanks, 
Karen

ps:  who is invoicing TXU for what they owe us?

For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02.
