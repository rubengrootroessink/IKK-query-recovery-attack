At Lisa Bill's request, please submit for payment an invoice for all gas agency fees due ENA under the verbal agreement with PPEP since the time of bankruptcy.  Also, please "Respond to All" to let the deal team know when the invoice has been issued, what amounts are being billed (by month) and the date on which the payment is due under the terms of our verbal agreement.

Thanks.
