Importance: High


TXU LSP is planning to perform smart pig maintenance on Line X June 4-6,
which will affect receipts and deliveries.  Please call your Transportation
Administrator for affected receipts and deliveries.  It is possible that a
second maintenance event may occur late in the month.

Due to system constraints all Shippers must stay within contract swing
limits.

Imbalance makeup may be scheduled with prior approval from your
Transportation Administrator.

In our ongoing effort to keep TXU Lone Star Pipeline customers aware of
current Daily Available Capacity on our system, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is
pleased to provide you an estimate of available capacity on the TXU Lone
Star Pipeline system.  This is a Microsoft Excel document.  Simply click on
