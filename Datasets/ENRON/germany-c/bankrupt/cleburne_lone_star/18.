Ed, we have been looking at the best alternatives for addressing all aspects of this deal, including the gas agreement. Rick Hill & I will explain where we are in general & w.r.t. The gas agreement. We can then followup with the cornhusker deal team on your concerns as we need to meet for an update on a course of action independent of this concern.
Regards, lisa
