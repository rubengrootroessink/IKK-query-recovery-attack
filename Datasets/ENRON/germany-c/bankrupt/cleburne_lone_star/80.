Chris,

Can you reattach the file that Jeff sent. I believe it is the imbalance schedule I was looking for!

Also, looking for some historical info. Did Joe Parks leave any history with regards to transactions in December or January?? Specifically, did Ponderosa through Enron sell any gas to third parties in those months??

MM
