TXU LSP is planning to perform smart pig maintenance activities on Line X
Gas Day June 18 (Tuesday) and Gas Day June 21 (Friday).  Gas Days June 19
and 20 will be normal flow days, and the weekend of June 22 - 24 will be
normal flow days.  The portion of the line that is to be maintained is the
same portion as the maintenance earlier this month. Please contact your
representatives if there are any questions.
