Cornerstone has an ISDA which was terminated effective 11/28/01.  They have two outstanding invoices (possibly others that I am not aware of) in the amounts of $1,747,664.00  and $234,418.54.  Other outstanding invoices must be related to physical transactions.

Legal's termination log contains the following comment: "Cornerstone will make no further payments or delivery."

Hope this helps.

It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of?

Neither of these companies have paid us for December 2001 gas.  MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value, I don't know about Cornerstone.  Both had invoices sent to them for December sales.  Attached is Cornerstone's SAP balance.  Call me if you need any further information.
