Phil:

After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the majority of
the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small rounding
differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several months
where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

Let me know if you need further information from me.
