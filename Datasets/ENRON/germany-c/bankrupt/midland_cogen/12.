Thanks.

The total amount we invoiced them for is $1,701,160.65.  I have a call into my contact there for information on what they didn't pay.  When I talked with her last week she did not indicate a short payment on the invoiced amount.  I will fax you the invoices.  

Also, I check in Unify this morning and nothing has come across for that 155,000 MMBtus.  So it is still not invoiced.

The $1,272,099 payment received from MCV was a lot less than I thought it would be.  I know that we had not yet invoiced them for 155,000 MMs on Panhandle, but the revenue associated with this was only $381,300.  My estimated total payment was for $2,038,374. 

What did we actually invoice them for in total?  If you could fax me the invoices to 646-3037.

Thanks.
