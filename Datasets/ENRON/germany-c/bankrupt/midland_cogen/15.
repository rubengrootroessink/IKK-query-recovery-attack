Attached is a spreadsheet containing what MCV is claiming is due to them for non-deliveries for April.  Do you think the replacement price makes sense?

Thanks Renee.  Is there anyway you could scan and send me the the invoice
you sent us for $384,975 (your Control Number 103027)?  I have a faxed
copy, but the numbers are difficult to read on it.  Otherwise, maybe you
could just send me a spreadsheet with the numbers on there?

Thanks,

   Phil:

   After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
   majority of
   the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
   rounding
   differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several
   months
   where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

   Let me know if you need further information from me.
