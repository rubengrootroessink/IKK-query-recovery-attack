The $1,272,099 payment received from MCV was a lot less than I thought it would be.  I know that we had not yet invoiced them for 155,000 MMs on Panhandle, but the revenue associated with this was only $381,300.  My estimated total payment was for $2,038,374. 

What did we actually invoice them for in total?  If you could fax me the invoices to 646-3037.

Thanks.
