Chris,

Attached is the work I have done on MCV.  I believe that we still need to do the following:

1)  Bill them for the April PEPL volumes.

2)  Bill them for the 1 day's swing gas

3)  Look historically at what they have been billed by month and compare it to what was actually paid.  This needs to tie out with the "true" pricing.

Let me know when you are ready to discuss.

Phil
