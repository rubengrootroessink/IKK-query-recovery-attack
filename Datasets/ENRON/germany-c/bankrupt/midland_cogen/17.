I just talked with Rita Wynne and she says that the deal on Panhandle for Midland Cogen has to be "scheduled" for it to come across to the back office.  If you could have this done as soon as possible we would be able to get an invoice out to them for payment.  Please call me if you need any further information and let me know when this is done.


Thanks
Priscilla
