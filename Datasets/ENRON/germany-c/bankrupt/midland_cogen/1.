	the city of tallahassee took zero swing over the weekend and will be taking zero for tomorrow 5/21.
	
	the trunkline work is over and  mcv wants the gas back for tomorrow.  i spoke with jim at reliant and 
	they will go back to pre-maintenance noms for tomorrow.

	phil,

	i will look at the numbers but given the fact that city of tall took zero over the weekend and zero for tomorrow,
	i don't expect to need a cash request for this week.  i'll let you know if we do.

	robin
