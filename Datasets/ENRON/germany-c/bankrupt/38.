Shemin,

As I mentioned yesterday, the attached file was requested by Steve Van Hooser. It contains the listing of transport contracts that we intend to reject. The file is not complete and I continue to add contracts as they are brought to my attention.

 



Let me know if you have any questions and/or if you would like a different format or need additional information listed.
