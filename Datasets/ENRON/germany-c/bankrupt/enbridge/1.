I just talke with Joe Green in the tax department and made him aware of the GST that we collected.  I am not seeing this deal in Unify yet and that needs to happen so that GST will hit the GL.  However, our tax department now knows we collected that tax and that it needs to be remitted to Canada.

Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American

310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00

Goods and Services Tax  $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00

Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00

Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?
