Gumba!

What's cooking?  I work tomorrow.  Jerry can holler at me if  he wants.  How
are  you?  How did your back get?  I have not heard back from Gerald on the
tractor and lease.  I guess if he wants it that will be good.  If he does
not want it, I guess that will be good as well.
It is 4:30 and I am ready to depart from here in my room!  Keep your powder
dry and be safe!

Yo'  Bro'

I've signed off on the settlement.  Now when would you gentleman like to
get together?  Both of you need to sign the settlement in front of a
notary as well.
