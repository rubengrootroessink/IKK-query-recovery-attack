I trust everyone had a nice Thanksgiving (US customers).  The weather sure did cooperate with a long weekend if you weren't too long on gas?!

We have NO excess injections available for the East or West side.

I have 120,000 dth available through Concord today.  The backhaul from Leidy to Niagara looked attractive to me this morning.

NO IAS OR ISS injections.
