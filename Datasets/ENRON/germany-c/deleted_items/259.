Is today going to be a busy day?  I can't believe a FORECAST of possible future cold weather can move the market like it did yesterday.  Is that because I'm so green in this business?  Or is something else going on?

AGA?  Over or under 60Bcf?

IT through Concord is available for 30,000 dth.

Due to some cold weather I have room for excess injections on the East Side 30,000 dth, West Side 10,000 dth.

Excess withdrawals' or IAS system wide up to 100,000dth.
