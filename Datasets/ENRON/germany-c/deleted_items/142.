PJM Expands Grid

    PJM Interconnection plans to spend more than $420 million on the 2nd phase of a transmission infrastructure plan to increase reliability. This will be in addition to a $300 million transmission investment PJM initiated last summer. With a total of about 40,000 MW proposed for construction in the region, PJM last year implemented a Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to ensure the system continues to comply with regional reliability standards. The 2nd phase of the RTEP calls for transmission upgrades to accommodate 43 generation projects PJM expects to have online by the end of 2006, with a total of more than 12,500 MW of new capacity.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower yesterday in uninspired trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's surprising high storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local and short-term traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price discovery. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could initiate sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays lackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, much of the eastern half of the nation will have more summer-like weather this weekend and early next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, but will not be unusually high for early June. Hot weather in the southwestern states will begin to mo!
ve!
 into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look for the market to continue to slip lower in the absence of any significant driving force. There needs to be something to change the dynamics of the market, but in the meantime, most everybody is on the same page, and the locals are simply trying to pick each other's pockets. The next key level of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MMBtu, except out west where prices continued to tumble. Canadian spot prices rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per MMBtu.

DOE Seeks Input on Research Programs

    The DOE plans a series of town hall-style meetings next week across the nation to hear from the public, elected officials and energy experts on federal research programs that promote energy efficiency and more use of renewable fuels. The input at these meetings will help the DOE identify opportunities for future research and investment while assessing our past effectiveness. The meetings are part of a comprehensive review of the department's multibillion dollar research programs as called for in the Bush administration's new national energy plan. Environmental and consumers groups have opposed the administration's proposed budget cuts in the research programs. The first two public meetings will take place on June 12th in Atlanta and Chicago, followed by June 19th meetings in Boston and Seattle, June 21st in Denver and Philadelphia and a June 26th meeting in Washington. Each meeting will last from 9 AM to 9 PM local time.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices

    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate Governmental Affairs Committee says he will examine FERCs refusal to cap wholesale power prices in western states. Following the recent shift in control of the Senate to Democrats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that the FERC has failed to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the matter. President Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price caps, arguing they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do nothing to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation, Lieberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into the oil industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices.

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas

    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural gas volumes from shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian Petroleum and Penn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to investigate whether natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep can be produced economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas production from coal seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135 Tcf and 260 Tcf of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least 17 Tcf have been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market will cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lines, meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Arctic reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years researching ways to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million to proceed with a pilot pr!

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues

    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by El Paso is still proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the California PUC have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing looks no closer to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It dutifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spreads. As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of political economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Brattle's tale doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 conditions must be met: * The system for getting gas to California must not be full; * El Paso Merchant must have unutilized, but available, delivery rights; and * Other shippers!
 m!
ust have fully utilized their delivery rights. The final condition, he says proves that market power is impossible to establish.
