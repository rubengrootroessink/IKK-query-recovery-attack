Natural Gas Futures Rally

    Natural gas futures jumped sharply higher yesterday following the AGA report of a 99 Bcf increase in natural gas storage last week, below market expectations. Prices slumped early as traders awaited the release of the inventory data. The July contract gained $0.171 to $3.981 per MMBtu. August climbed $0.162 to $4.055 per MMBtu. Some traders are not convinced the rally, which saw the market climb $0.30 from the Wednesday trading low, is for real. El Paso was a large seller yesterday, but they got taken out by Enron buying. Look for the market to open even higher this morning as it takes out $4.00. Natural gas prices for next day delivery across the US and Canada were generally lower yesterday, except in the west where spot prices continue to rise sharply. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.17 to $3.66 per MMBtu.

California Governor Gives FERC 30 Days to Act or Else

   Californias governor says he will give FERC at least 30 days to take steps to help solve the state's energy crisis before going forward with the lawsuit he has been promising. His vow to file his own lawsuit against FERC follows a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Tuesday to deny a similar lawsuit filed by two state legislative leaders. That lawsuit said FERC was failing in its legal duty to ensure just and reasonable energy prices in California. But the federal appeals court said the legislators had failed to demonstrate court intervention was warranted. The governors spokesman said the cop needs to be on the beat and not hiding behind some false ideology that is not relevant, evidently referring to capitalism. The governor also said the federal government should order refunds of 40% to 50% to send a strong signal to energy companies in Texas and in the South to stop bleeding us dry, stop taking us to the cleaners, and charge reasonable rat!

FERC Chairman Defends Record

    FERC Chairman Hebert has defended his agency against charges by California's governor that it has failed to act on the state's power crisis, and said lawsuits to make the FERC impose price caps would likely be a waste of time and money. Hebert says he feels good about winning any legal challenge by anyone from California. He also noted FERC has issued a price mitigation plan for California, which would help ease the power shortage crisis if the state would just cooperate.

Massey Calls for Change in Market Power Definition

    FERC Commissioner Massey, dissenting from two orders, strongly called for the commission to revise its current method of market power analysis, saying it is just plain outdated, inadequate and unreliable. Massey says the hub-and-spoke method of market power analysis, which presumes market power if any single market participant holds a 20% market share, does not work. In April, PG&E and SCE asked FERC to deny renewal of market-based rate authority to Williams Energy Marketing and Trading, saying that while Williams controls less than 20% of the generation resources in the state, it is still able to exercise market power. To renew its market-based rate authority, Williams should perform an analysis of market power using other means, the utilities said. Massey says the events of the California wholesale power market, where no single power seller holds close to 20% market share during the past year, demonstrate that market power can be exercised by any player holding a much !
sm!
aller piece of the market.

Metcalf Power Plant Set for Approval

    San Joses mayor, a vocal opponent of a proposed 600 MW, natural gas fired power plant planned for California's Silicon Valley, has reversed course and accepted an agreement that should pave the way for the project's approval. Facing an onslaught of pressure, the mayor announced a compromise with project developers. Most California officials support the project, including the state's mainline environmental groups the governor. Computer networking giant, Cisco Systems, which plans to build an office complex near Metcalf for 20,000 employees, has fought the plant. Three main points in the agreement that had been problems for Cisco: * The time it takes to shutdown the plant for maintenance and start it up again will be cut by 25% during the first five years to further reduce emissions. * Calpine agreed to set up two new air-monitoring stations near Metcalf that will be independently monitored to ensure it is meeting strict emissions requirements. * Calpine will adopt technol!
og!
ies reducing or eliminating the use of liquid ammonia as soon as these systems are approved by state regulators and are proven economically feasible. Metcalf will also offer long-term power contracts at competitive prices for San Jose businesses. The plant has taken on symbolic value, and industry analysts say the outcome will be a key sign of how the state will deal with its power crisis. Metcalf would be the first major power plant built in Silicon Valley in 20 years.

Energy Companies Using More Credit Derivatives

   Energy companies are using more credit derivatives both to hedge existing risk and make money by trading them, and need to adjust their risk management strategies to compensate, according to a report by Standard & Poor's. Many energy trading firms are augmenting their credit risk management practices through the use of credit derivatives, while others attempt to profit by trading credit derivatives, the report says. Credit derivatives are contracts that let companies transfer credit risk. Buying them works like insurance against a company going bankrupt, paying out if a trigger event occurs. Companies trading energy commodities such can use financial derivatives as a hedge. Enron is one of the heaviest traders of credit derivatives as a market maker.

Conoco to Help Arctic Pipeline Plans

    Conocos takeover of Gulf Canada Resources should add political power to the plans of a group of major oil companies to build a natural gas pipeline from Canada's Arctic, according to Gulf's CEO. Conoco has offered C$12.40 per share in cash for Gulf. Gulf's partners in the study of the C$3 billion pipeline include Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil. Gulf has an estimated 1.3 Tcf of natural gas reserves in the region. Last week, the group negotiated an agreement with native leaders from the Northwest Territories that would have the Aboriginal Pipeline Group owning up to a third of the pipeline. Debate has long centered on whether a pipeline from northern Alaska or the Mackenzie Delta would be built first, or whether the market could initially support both.
