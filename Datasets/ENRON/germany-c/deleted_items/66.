Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly; Cash Slips

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX ended higher Friday on pre-weekend short-covering, but closed off its highs after failing to break above resistance at $4.00 per MMBtu. In early trading, prices slid to the lows of the day, but short-covering by trade and commercial accounts lifted prices once it became clear they would fall no further. The July contract settled up $0.016 at $3.93 per MMBtu. August rose $0.019 to $4.009 per MMBtu. With only moderate warmer weather conditions forecast, the upward price momentum was lost. Rumors that the AGA was going to revise last weeks storage report lower, sparked some buying and prompting short covering. Last week the AGA reported an injection of 99 Bcf, and the rumors suggested that number could be dropped to the mid-80s. This rumor was later reported to have been false, sparking the return to selling. Look for generally mild to warm weather conditions across most of the nation this week. California will continue to be hot this week. !
Ma!
ny traders are expecting the market to test $3.50 this week. Resistance is seen at $4.05, then $4.25; with support at $3.80, followed by $3.67. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to $0.10 lower last Friday. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub dipped $0.04 to $3.73 per MMBtu.

California ISO Protests RTO Filing

    The California ISO has has agreed, under protest, to FERCs demand from that it file to create a RTO, while maintaining the requirement is illegal and inappropriate. The ISO faced a June 1st deadline to file a RTO plan or risk losing FERC-backed emergency price controls. The ISO claims that it is not legal or appropriate to condition price controls on anything. So far, there are 2 RTOs planned for the western US. RTO West is mostly based in the Pacific Northwest and Desert Star mainly consists of Southwest utilities. FERC would like to see just one RTO in the western region. The filing called for the ISO itself to become a third western RTO, a move that would appear to make little practical difference to the running of the agency. FERC Chairman Hebert has said it was necessary to require California to join at RTO, claiming no price relief plan could open clogged transmission systems and build new infrastructure. The FERCs price relief plan, which is only imposed during pe!
ri!
ods when the ISO has declared a power emergency, requires generators to offer available electricity in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery. The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highest-cost generator asked to supply power to the grid.

Edison Rescue Plan May Fall Apart

    The rescue agreement between the state of California and Southern California Edison may fall apart because the PUC is not ready to implement parts of it by a June 8th deadline. Edison International says the agenda for a June 7th meeting lacks items that have to be implemented by the following day. Failure to implement those items would give either Californias DWR or SCE the right to back out of the agreement which calls for the state to buy Edison's share of the power grid for $2.76 billion. Collapse of that agreement may force SCE into bankruptcy. Shares of Edison closed up $0.17 Friday at $11.00, but have fallen 30% this year.

Democratic Senate and Bush Energy Plan on Collision Course

   The energy agenda of the new Democratic-controlled Senate is about to clash with the Bush administration on electricity price caps for California, drilling in Alaskan and  soaring gasoline prices. While President Bush favors more drilling and coal use as part of a national energy policy, many Democrats prefer increased conservation and stricter mileage standards for vehicles to save fuel. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has already been declared dead by new Senate Majority Leader Daschle.. Democratic lawmakers are expected to push for higher gasoline mileage for sports utility vehicles as part of the solution. The National Academy of Sciences is due to issue a report in July on possible higher vehicle fuel standards. The administration has said it will wait for that report before deciding what to do with current fuel requirements. Currently, US autos must average 27.5 miles per gallon, but light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles are required to avera!
ge !
20.7 miles per gallon. The US market uses about 20 million barrels per day. The biggest fight with the administration is expected to come over the issue of price caps on power sales in California. As the state prepares for rolling blackouts this summer, Senate Democrats plan to move forward with legislation requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary price caps in western states. Senate Democratic lawmakers also plan a new probe of the energy industry's record profits.

Marathon to Replace Enron

     Marathon will replace Enron in the recently formed consortium to develop a $5 billion natural gas project in Saudi Arabia. On May 18yh, Saudi Arabia awarded Enron, Occidental and ExxonMobil stakes in the Red Sea natural gas package, one of three projects on offer under the kingdom's $25 billion natural gas development opening. ExxonMobil will retain the lead role, with 60%, while both Marathon and Occidental will have 20% interests. Last month, Enron also bowed out of Dolphin Energy, which is majority owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates and beginning a $3.5 billion project to transport Qatari natural gas to the UAE.

Mirant Leery California Power Plans

    Just days after California approved construction of a 530 MW power plant, Mirant says it does not know when it would begin to build the $275 million facility because of uncertainty about the state's energy market. Mirant is concerned about speculation among California officials that the state should impose a windfall profits tax on energy companies and seize power plants. Last week, the governor praised the plant, saying it was the 16th major generating facility licensed during his 2 years in office, bringing the overall number of new MW approved to 10,400. The plant would be built at Mirant's Contra Costa generating facility northeast of SF.

California Rate Freeze to Continue

     A federal bankruptcy judge let stand a state freeze on power rates charged by PG&E, blocking it from passing billions of dollars in back debt on to its customers. The decision effectively leaves the rate freeze in effect possibly through next March. PG&E says it will continue to pursue all legal challenges to this unlawful decision.
