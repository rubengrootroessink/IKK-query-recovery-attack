Natural Gas Futures and Cash Continue Lower

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower after the AGA announced natural gas inventories jumped 117 Bcf last week, well above market expectations. The July contract fell $0.091 to $3.801 per MMBtu and August dipped $0.087 to $3.888 per MMBtu. The AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. Last years injection was 78 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 81 Bcf for the comparable weeks. The large build was driven by a lack of demand on Memorial Day and mild weather. Warmer weather is expected to affect much of the nation over the next several days, limiting the upside reaction. The hot weather in the southwestern states will begin to expand into Texas and the central Plains this weekend extending into the Southeast next week. Look for the market to continue lower today under the weight of the 117 Bcf injection. But, with the summer heat and the hurricanes beginning to show up, it is becomin!
g !
increasingly dangerous to short the market. The next key level of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.15  $0.25 per MMBtu, except out west where prices tumbled over $1.00. Canadian spot prices tumbled about $0.50 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.23 to $3.76 per MMBtu.

Enron's Dabhol Takes MSEB to Court

    Enron's Dabhol Power has filed a petition before the Bombay high court challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission in trying to resolve a dispute between it and an Indian state utility that has threatened nearly $3 billion worth of foreign investment. MSEB began defaulting on its payments six months ago to Dabhol saying that its power was too costly. It also cancelled its purchases and said it would be unable to lift output from the second phase. Dabhol filed for arbitration
and issued a preliminary notice to cancel its contract with MSEB. The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. Global credit rating agency Moody's said last week the dispute has raised concerns over whether India would be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. Foreign lenders want to cancel their loans worth $600 million to the project while the local lenders are against it.

BPA Power Contract Rates Up

    The BPA says wholesale power rates will be offered at a 150% or greater premium in October, and that it has achieved 51% of its goal to lower demand for its power. For aluminum producers, that means they would have to pay about $50 per MWh for BPA power once their new five-year contract takes effect on October 1st. That is a substantial increase over the $24 per MWh smelters in the Pacific Northwest were used to paying under their expiring five-year contracts, but much less than the 250% to 300% increase BPA anticipated last April. The BPA has been negotiating with industrial customers to reduce their power demand. In return, BPA agrees to pay their employees' wages. Most aluminum smelters in the Northwest have already curtailed or stopped operating to comply with BPA's request. Customers have until June 22nd to complete their negotiations for power contracts. On June 29th, BPA will submit power rates to the FERC.

New Coal Fired Power Plants Making Comeback

    New coal-fired power plants are now being planned after a decade in which almost none were built in the US. But, now 34 coal plants are being planned to meet ever increasing power needs across the nation. Energy Secretary Abraham has called for 1,300 new power plants over the next 20 years to meet projected demand. Electricity demand has more than doubled over the last 20 years. Coal currently fires more than half of US electricity production. The expansion of coal power plants has been put off pollution concerns. Cleaner burning natural gas produces only 15% of the nation's power, but increasing quickly. Natural gas emits 43% less carbon dioxide than conventional coal burning. As a result, 90% of planned power plants are natural gas fired. But, now scrubbers that cut up to 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions and growing amounts of nitrogen oxide. Peabody Group, the largest coal company in the world, is planning a $1.5 billion 1,500 MW Thoroughbred plant slated to come onlin!

California Power Bill Dead

    House Republicans have declared dead a proposed bill to help California avoid summer power outages, after Democrats refused to drop demands for wholesale price caps opposed by President Bush. But as power shifts from Republicans to Democrats in the Senate, there is a continued battle over price controls. The FERC, which has authority to cap prices, also opposes them. Republicans, without more support, simply ran out of time to help California, which faces many hours of blackouts this summer. The proposed legislation would have also waived some clean air regulations to allow power plants to operate during peak times, relieved transmission congestion with new lines and forced the federal government to cut energy use in its California offices 20%. The bill-writing session collapsed after California Rep. Waxman sought an amendment to stop what he called price-gouging by wholesale power sellers.

Study Says More Natural Gas Drilling Restricted

    More of the recoverable natural gas in the Rocky Mountains is off-limits to drilling than previously thought, according to a new DOE study. A review found that about 68% of the recoverable supplies in the Greater Green River Basin in southern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado, up to 79 Tcf, is either closed to drilling or under significant access restrictions. The conclusions are much higher than a similar 1999  study which said 40% was off limits. The US consumes about 23 Tcf of natural gas per year. The studied area covered almost 29 million acres of land with almost 160 Tcf of gas, of which 16 million acres with 117 Tcf was under federal ownership. Slightly over two-thirds of the recoverable federal natural gas in the study was either closed to development or available with restrictions.

TRENTON/BLACKRIVER "BOOM" IN WEST VIRGINIA

partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000 acres would also make a great gas storage field.

We also have another small storage field for sale near the new Trenton Wells.

PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy

    A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a state-sponsored $2.76 billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility into bankruptcy. The PUC will meet today, but had not put on its agenda the regulatory changes which were agreed upon last April by the utility and the governor. If the PUC doesn't implement the changes by Friday, the state or the utility could back out of the plan. The political reality is that Edison is likely going to slouch toward Chapter 11. The legislature has 120 days to approve the plan which has been faulted as too generous to SCE and of little use to consumers and creditors, while throwing California into the power generation business. SCE has a long line of creditors awaiting back payments, including at least 30 power generators that have sued it. It only takes three to throw the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. Some analysts think that risk is already very high.
