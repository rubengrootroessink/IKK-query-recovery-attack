Subject:  Ponderosa Pine prepayments

We are trying to match up the March 02 Ponderosa prepays with what is
currently in GasMaster and the two numbers do not equal.  Did they prepay
more than the nominated March deals?  Also could you confirm whether the
following are all the prepays that we received from Ponderosa.

02/28/02  63,750
03/01/02  111,600
03/04/02  187,500
03/08/02  128,450
03/15/02  388,000
