Natural Gas Futures Rally Above $4

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX jumped higher yesterday amid forecasts for above-average temperatures in Texas this week and revised predictions for warmer weather in July and August. The July contract gained $0.139 to $4.069 per MMBtu and August rose $0.142 to $4.151 per MMBtu. In spite of the price gain, it was a quiet day as none of the big players, Enron or El Paso, were very much involved. Industrial demand is on the rise again following weeks of declining natural gas prices was also seen as supportive. Some private forecasters have revised their summer predictions, and now believe July and August will be hotter than average. Summer forecasts have been changed to about 3  10 degrees above previous
prognostications. Forecasts hot weather in Texas this week also aided the rally. Also, last week's storage data may be a sign that industrial demand is increasing and utilities that switched to oil appear to be switching back, and the hurricane season has begun. However, the market is waiting for confirmation of the trend from tomorrows AGA storage report. If this weeks AGA injection number is 80 Bcf or less, the back of the bear could be broken, but most traders are expecting a much higher number. A rally to the $4.25 might encourage the funds to start covering their short positions. However, another triple-digit injection could keep the downtrend in place. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada jumped $0.20  $0.30 per MMBtu yesterday, driven by the futures rally. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.23 to $3.95 per MMBtu.

California PUC to Vote on Back QF Payments

     Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison would have to pay 15% of the money they owe to small power generators under an order to be voted on by the state PUC on Friday. But an organization representing the generators warned that approving the order would subject them to PUC regulation in addition to federal regulation, a problem they want to avoid. Many of the Qualifying Facilities have shutdown because they have not been paid hundreds of millions of dollars for power sold many months ago. Under an earlier PUC order, the utilities have been paying for QF power purchases since April and the small plants have been slowly returning to service. The order also proposes options for contract prices and incentive payments for excess power production by the QFs. The remaining debt would remain repayable, although the order says nothing about any future repayment schedule. The FERC ruled in May that the small power generators can sell electricity to third parties i!
f !
they have power available above and beyond the amount they need to meet their existing contractual agreements with the utilities.

House Energy Chairman Says Nation Facing Crisis

   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee says that the entire US is likely to face rolling blackouts like those plaguing California unless swift action was taken to build new power plants and increase natural gas production. He says the nation's high-tech economy could come to a crunching stop without an expansion of energy infrastructure and argued that government-imposed price caps would not provide a solution to high electricity prices. The EIA forecasts the will need 1,300  1,900 new power plants in the next 20 years to keep up with a projected 45% increase in demand.

California Largest State Economy

    A new report by the Commerce Department shows California makes up 13.2% of US economic output in 1999, the latest year for which data are available. That was well above the share of national economic output provided by the next largest state economies, New York at 8.1%, and Texas at 7.4%. From 1992 to 1999 California grew at a 3.9% annual rate, slightly higher than the 3.7% gain in national gross domestic product seen annually in the same period. Other Western states, including Nevada, Oregon and Washington all grew at a faster pace. Arizona, at a 7.3% annual rate of growth, was the fastest growing.

Deadline for PG&E Power Contracts Set

     A federal bankruptcy judge has ruled that PG&E has until June 29th to decide whether it will assume or reject energy contracts with a number of small generators who fear they will not be paid for future power. The judge also granted Calpine's request to postpone a hearing to determine whether the it can be released from its power contract until July 5th. If the judge allows Calpine and smaller Qualifying Facilities out of their contracts, they could sell their power for much higher prices on the spot market. But if PG&E assumes the QF contracts, it is required to immediately pay its pre-bankruptcy filing debts owed to them, totaling several hundred million dollars.

FERC Approves Hydropower Increase

   The FERC has approved a temporary increase in hydropower generation at the Priest Rapids Hydroelectric Project in Washington to help California avoid power shortages this summer. The commission will suspend rules on the spilling of dam waters during fish migration season this summer, allowing Priest Rapids to produce an additional 219,600 MWh of power. It is suspending part of an interim requirement which allows the licensee to spill water for 16 hours a day during the summer. It will allow for an exchange of spill and power with BPA, assuring flexibility and reliability to the regional grid and protecting listed fish species. The FERC is also seeking comment on an alternative plan that would suspend spill for an additional 8 hours per day, boosting generation to the region by 109,800 MWh. Hydropower accounts for 65% of the Pacific Northwest's electricity generation.

Westcoast to Expand Pipeline Capacity

    Westcoast Energy plans to expand it system by 250 MMcf per day of natural gas transportation capacity offered in two proposed pipeline expansions in western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. A recent open season to sell the capacity on the proposed pipeline expansions aimed at meeting a surge in demand from power plants was successful. Total volumes from both pipeline expansions, which could begin commercial service in 2003, would be more than enough supply for 1,500 MW of power generation. The expansions will link markets in the BC Lower Mainland and Pacific Northwest with supplies from BC, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. Westcoast is preparing to award 200 MMcf per day of expansion capacity on its Southern Mainline facilities to ten shippers with an average term of 27 years. It is also preparing to award 50 MMcf per day of new capacity on its Westcoast Alberta facilities to four shippers with an average term of 30 years.

NGI Reports June Natural Gas Prices Plummet

    Following on a month of mild weather with robust storage additions, natural gas spot prices for June dropped more than $1 from first-of-the-month May quotes at most points across the country, with the majority of prices coming in between $3.60 and $3.80. The June prices also were significantly below same time last year levels, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. The blockbuster turnaround was in California, where prices took a precipitous dive, led by a more than $4 drop in the Southern California-PG&E price to $6.77. While still high enough above the rest of the country to qualify as a separate market, the Southern California Border average of $11.70, fell from $14.64 in May. It didn't require a crystal ball to predict the price drop for June baseload gas, since prices had been steadily declining in the May after-market. The mild weather through much of the country, except California, and lack of air conditioning load has allowed eye-popping 100 Bcf-plus storage fill!
s !
for four weeks in a row. Storage levels, which had been below normal for more than a year, have climbed out of the basement, finally topping last year's levels in the survey for the week ending May 25th. As the storage fill level increased throughout May, the June futures contract declined, going off the board Tuesday at $3.738, or roughly $1.20 below the close of the May contract. A year ago all indexes, including California's, ranged from the $3.50s in the Rockies to the $4.60s in the Northeast. Now Northeast city-gates in the $4.10s lead the non-California pack, and Rockies prices have slipped below $3. The Henry Hub dropped from $4.89 last month to $3.73. June quotes were considerably below the winter bid-week highs registered in January of $16.32 at the Southern California border, $9.92 at the Henry Hub and $10.93 at the Chicago City-gate.
