Chris,

The New Power Company deal #649352 has a demand charge (income) of $1,183,732 that you added.  Do they owe us this money and how is it related to this deal.
I looked in your demand charge spreadsheet to see if we reflected it in our P&L through a reimbursement but am unable to find it.

Your help and input would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Kam
