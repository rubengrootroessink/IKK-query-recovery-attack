Short week!!!

Our open season for firm transportation from Pendleton to Elliisburg ends today.  Please call you firm services rep if you are interested or have any last minute questions.

I have 75,000 dth of excess on-system deliveries.  On-system deliveries include injections into storage and deliveries to the City Gate.  We believe that injections are going to prove tight since our distribution marketer's and LDC will probably serve their load with on system deliveries, not from removing gas from storage.  Therefore, I am not recommending you make excess injections into storage unless you have a secondary place to move the gas to if we get into a curtailment period tomorrow.

I have 80,000 through Concord.  The back haul spread looked very favorable this morning.  Call me if you are interested in using the path on the intra day or for tomorrow's gas day.

I'm disappointed the Bills game wasn't on TV yesterday.  It was 60 degrees and sunny.  We lost by three but Van Pelt showed up and played a "good" game.  My 14 point spread may have been slightly pre mature, maybe next week?
