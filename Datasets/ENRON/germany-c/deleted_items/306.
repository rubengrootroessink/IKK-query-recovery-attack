Buenos Dias (I'm practicing my Spanish because I'm going to Ecuador for New Year's Eve),

On an intra day basis I have 50,000 dth excess injection on the East Side (for the 20th).  Since it is getting a little cooler here I also have 20,000 dth available on the East Side for excess injection tomorrow, nothing on the West.

IT through Concord is available, 140,000dth.  50,000 at Niagara, the rest can flow through Pendleton.

No IAS payback or ISS space.

I will be off tomorrow.  Please call Greg Maliken if you have any questions about the long weekend 716-857-7634.

I can tell you now that Thursday and Friday are predicted to be warmer and our system load will be depressed due to the holiday.  Therefore, excess on system deliveries are not going to be large.  Please use the website.  There will be daily postings available.

Happy Turkey Eating!!

Abigail
