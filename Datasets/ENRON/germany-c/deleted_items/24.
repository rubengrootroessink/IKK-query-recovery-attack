Natural Gas Futures End Up on Local Short-Covering 

    Natural gas for July delivery on the NYMEX settled up $0.021 Friday at
$3.237 per MMBtu, boosted by late short-covering by locals. The August
contract gained $0.018 to $3.294 per MMBtu. Weather forecasts today will
determine whether physical prices can rise to support any futures rally,
if not the market will likely test $3.00 this week. Spreads will dominate
the market the closer the July contract gets to expiration. Funds turned
dramatically short in most recent Commitments of Traders Report from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Crude oil prices for the new front
August contract fell $0.13 Friday to $25.82 per barrel, mostly on news of
Venezuela increasing production. Estimated natural gas volume was 70,000
contracts, with about a third spreads. Natural gas for weekend delivery
across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natural
gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.12 to $3.17 per MMBtu.

Companies Consider Mexican Natural Gas Contracts

    Companies looking to enter Mexico's closed energy industry are
cautiously optimistic about the controversial 6-8 politically contested
multiple service contracts to produce natural gas in the Burgos basin on
the Texas border. Pemex plans to open a data room in November and says the
contracts would be finalized and the development blocks defined in
October. Pemex will offer the controversial multiple service contracts
individually in quick succession in November. The contracts would then be
evaluated by February and signed in March of 2003. However, the question
for the companies is whether the incentive of the deals compared to other
options around the world are great enough to warrant the investment. Under
the Mexican constitution, Pemex is not allowed to offer a percentage of
the commodity produced as payment to companies, because all natural
resources must remain in the hands of a government agency. In lieu of a
percentage, Pemex proposes payment for services according to a menu of
prices, but payment will depend on Mexico receiving income from natural
gas produced. Some big oil companies contend that scenario puts the burden
of risk on them, especially if natural gas prices plunge. The new
contracts will be renewable for up to 20 years instead of only 1 or 2
years. Opponents say they are a means of privatizing the country's oil and
natural gas industry, which was nationalized in 1938 and is widely
regarded as a symbol of Mexican sovereignty and economic independence.
However, a number of companies are interested in the contracts, some just
to get a foothold in Mexico's energy sector. But, there are also concerns
about the short amount of time allowed by Pemex between the opening of the
data room in November for seismic information and the award of bids in
February, because it forces companies into offering conservative bids.
Pemex indicated it might be open to extending the time frame.

NRC Cites Wisconsin Electric Nuclear Power Plant

    The NRC has ruled that Wisconsin Electric Power's 512 MW Point Beach 2
nuclear power plant will be cited with a 'low-to-moderate' safety
violation. The NRC says that on February 20th a pump in the unit's
emergency cooling system broke down because of a build-up of nitrogen in
pipes, which had leaked into the pipes from another part of the plant
emergency system. Point Beach is owned by Wisconsin Electric Power and
operated by Nuclear Management Co. The NRC called  the ruling a 'white'
finding in its four-color system for safety violations ranging in severity
from green to white, yellow and red for the most serious violations.
Nuclear Management did not contest the finding.

Williams to Eliminate Energy Trading Positions  

    Williams will eliminate 16% of its energy marketing and trading
positions this week as it adjusts to an industry decline. Last week,
Williams announced a plan to cut merchant energy jobs and other measures
to save $50 million a year. The company has about 800 US employees in its
trading and marketing unit and about 132 of those will lose their jobs
this week. Williams also laid off 11 traders, or 13% of its trading staff,
in London. The company has about 12,000 employees in total. The energy
trading sector is dwindling as governmental investigations and stricter
credit rating criteria erode investor confidence. Williams, El Paso Corp,
Aquila and many others have curtailed their trading and are selling assets
and stock to improve their balance sheets in a move to reassure investors
and credit rating agencies.  Williams has cut financing for its trading
unit by 33%. It plans to sell more than $1 billion in assets by the end of
2002, including refineries in Tennessee and Alaska, to raise cash and cut
debt. Williams' shares dropped $0.22 to $7.13.

Idacorp to Pull Back from Power Trading 

    Idacorp, a power utility with 700,000 customers in Idaho, Oregon and
Nevada, said it will gradually reduce its power trading business and
layoff about 60 employees as credit rating agencies tighten their
requirements for an investment grade rating in the energy trading
industry, thus reducing the number of credit worthy trading partners. The
sector is shriveling amid a myriad of governmental and regulatory
investigations into questionable trading practices and tougher standards
by rating agencies. Idacorp Energy will discontinue trying to attract new
customers, it said. The cuts, which will eliminate about 50% of the unit's
120 positions will be made over 18 months, and Idacorp will reduce working
capital for the business by 50% to $100 million. Dynegy announced last
week that it would close down DynegyDirect, its online trading platform,
due to the reduced number of power and natural gas trades amid industry
liquidity concerns. The decision will not have an impact on expected 2002
earnings of $1.35-$1.70 per share, Idacorp said. Analysts average
estimates are $1.46 per share. Idacorp Energy will lower its maximum value
at risk to under $3 million from $10 million. The unit had an average of
$1.4 million at risk and a high of $2.4 million in the 1st quarter. Shares
of Idacorp dropped $0.40 to $26.66 on Friday.

NEB Denies TransCanadas Rate Hike Request

    The National Energy Board has denied TransCanada PipeLines' bid to
increase prices on its main natural gas pipeline system. TransCanada
claims the hike is needed in order to remain competitive and help offset
the loss of long-term transportation contracts. TransCanada had asked the
NEB to change the way regulated tolls on its west-east pipeline system are
calculated to bring returns more in line with pipelines in the US.
Canadian natural gas producers are opposed to the plan, saying it would
require them to pay an extra $179 million to transport supplies. The NEB
decided to continue calculating tariffs using the same method, but raised
tolls minimally to compensate for increased business risks resulting from
new pipeline competition and an industry shift towards short-term shipping
contracts. TransCanada applied for an after-tax weighted average cost of
capital of 7.5%, up from 5.84% in 2001. If the proposal was denied,
TransCanada said it would seek a deemed common equity component of 40%, up
from 30%, providing a return on common equity of 12.5%, or about the same
as under the cost of capital proposal. Instead, the NEB decided to keep
its previous method of determining tolls in tact and it set a rate of
return for the mainline of 9.61% for 2001 and 9.53% in 2002. It also
raised the deemed common equity component to 33%, in effect increasing
tolls by 2% for the 2-year period.

Credit Concerns Erode Energy Trading Business

    The shrinking natural gas trading industry in the US and Canada, amid
concerns over credit ratings and investor confidence, has made it
increasingly difficult to find buyers. After Aquila and Engage Energy
recently announced that they were closing their Canadian operations, the
gap in trading partners grew significantly. Some of Engage's operations
will be taken over by Duke's Canadian natural gas trading operation. Duke
acquired Engage as part of its $8.5 billion takeover of Westcoast Energy.
Traders say they are buying natural gas, but are having a hard time
turning it around because credit concerns have eroded the number of
companies they are currently allowed to deal with. Credit rating agencies
have indicated that energy trading companies may not qualify for an
investment grade rating due to the volatility of the sector. Last week,
Aquila said it was pulling back from the energy trading after cutting its
earnings forecast and dividend. Industry insiders say that Aquila was told
if they had a trading company, their credit would be downgraded, and if
they didn't, their investment grade rating would be maintained. However,
the shift away from energy trading could prove beneficial to electronic
trading platforms, in which participants have to clear credit requirements
before they can post any bids or offers. Also, the downturn in energy
marketing could leave the door open to a company with a good credit rating
and deep pockets to step in and grab a big share of the market right off
the bat. In addition, it is not likely such a company would encounter any
shortage of qualified traders, given the number of lay-offs in the field
lately.
