Not Wednesday cause I'll be getting ready for turkey day.   How about Tuesday
night.   May change depending on when Barb comes home.  But I plan on Tuesday.

I WANT TO GO.  Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.  I'm almost
positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).  You
won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to
sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat.

   I'm going to see Harry Potter this week.  It's two one half hours long.
   You
   want to go?   Barb does not want to go with me.    I'll come up to
   Houston to
   see it.  Need to pick up a honey cured ham anyway.  If you do not want
   to go, no
   sweat.   I was thinking about going tonight anyway.
