Big football weekend in Western New York.  People have bounties out for Flutie's head!  The local radio station is having a bon fire to throw Flutie Voo Doo Dolls into tonight!

Excess injections and IAS is available for the weekend.

No excess withdrawal's.  All of you firm shippers are resisting withdrawing gas.  All of you who owe us gas can blame them, NOT me.

Although I space through Concord, Niagara is full for IT for the weekend.
