Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower

    Natural gas on the NYMEX closed lower yesterday, but the market found
support and bounced off intra-day lows. Pressure from high storage builds
and mild weather across the eastern half of the nation pushed the market
down from Wednesday's gains. Early losses were offset by fund and managed
account purchases as well as stop loss buying, but prevailing floor
sentiment prompted local and short-term traders to sell near the end of the
session. The July contract dipped $0.067 lower to $3.914 per MMBtu, after
rallying as high as $4.075 in after-hours Access trading following the
Wednesday's AGA report of a 99 Bcf injection last week. August lost $0.65 to
$3.99 per MMBtu. Total storage inventories are at 1.281 Tcf, 7 Bcf more than
a year ago, but about 27 Bcf below the 5-year average. The year-on-year
storage surplus was the first since January 2000. August futures lost $0.065
to $3.99 per MMBtu. Look for the market to open lower this morning as it
remains under pressure until hotter weatheris forecast or fear of a Gulf of
Mexico hurricane appears. Technical support is expected at $3.69 per MMBtu,
with resistance at $4.29. Morgan Stanley Research estimates new US
production will be 51.4 Bcf per day in 2001, compared with 49.6 Bcf per day
in 1999. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally $0.05  $0.15 per MMBtu higher yesterday. Western prices continued
to jump higher. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained
$0.11 to $3.77 per MMBtu.

ANR Cuts HIOS Volumes; Mainline Work Planned

    ANR Pipeline says volumes from the High Island Offshore System and West
Cameron near shore blocks have been reduced by 40 MMcf per day due to
compression outages at Grand Chenier. The reduction began Wednesday and will
remain in place until further notice. ANR is also planning to perform
pipeline maintenance on its Southeast Mainline beginning June 4th and
continuing through July 6th. The work will reduce capacity by 195 MMcf per
day from June 4th  10th, 225 MMcf per day June 11th  12th, and by 60 MMcf
per day June 13th  24th. June 25th  26th, capacity will be reduced by 140
MMcf per day and by 220 MMcf  per day from June 27th to July 3rd. The work
will cut capacity by 25 MMcf per day from July 4th  6th. ANR's system
consists of 10,600 miles of pipeline and 74 compressor stations with a

Guardian to Change Eminent Domain Procedures

    Guardian Pipeline has decided to change its approach to the eminent
domain procedures. Instead of using federal eminent domain statutes,
Guardian will now follow Wisconsin state procedures, a move that should help
appease  landowners. A group of landowners had contested FERC's decision to
certify the project, claiming to be misled about Guardian's plans for using
eminent domain.

Mexico Natural Gas Expansion Behind Schedule

   Mexico's natural gas expansion is behind schedule despite the foreign
companies Gas Natural, Gaz de France and Tractebel having met their
investment targets. The contractors have been unable to complete works on
time, bureaucracy has been excessive and natural gas prices have been
volatile. In mid-2000, Gas Natural bought Comercializadora Metrogas and is
now market leader committed to investing $428 million by 2004.

Iroquois Recognized for Safety Record

    Iroquois Pipeline has been honored by the American Gas Association,
receiving their annual Safety Achievement Award for the 4th time. The AGA
honored 64 member companies during their Annual Operations Conference in
Dallas. "We take pride in our strong safety record, and in the emphasis each
of our employees places on personal and operational safety," said the
company president. The award honors companies who surpass the standards for
injuries and illnesses set by the OSHA. AGA members invest millions of
dollars each year to maintain an outstanding safety record and AGA honors
companies that are setting the pace in the important area of accident
prevention and workplace safety. Iroquois Gas Transmission System is the
owner of an interstate pipeline extending 375 miles from the US-Canadian
border at Waddington, NY, through the state of Connecticut to South Commack,
Long Island, NY. It has added two short lateral lines, several meter
stations and three compressor stations at Wright, Croghan, and Athens, NY.

AEP Plans Trade Mission to Mexico

    Companies interested in exploring business opportunities in Mexico are
invited to participate in a trade mission that American Electric Power will
sponsor September 10th  14th. AEP, through its Going Global export
assistance program, will lead visits to Monterrey and Mexico City.
Participants will meet one-on-one and in small groups with representatives
of Mexican companies that want to do business with US firms. We have helped
nearly 70 companies develop sales in the Mexican market, says the
international development manager who heads the program. The US provides 74%
of Mexico's imports. Dozens of companies have found these trade missions a
cost-effective method to evaluate market potential and develop sales. AEP
launched Going Global in 1994 to help small to medium-sized businesses

Experts Say Build More California Power
Plants and Ensure Competition

    As the Bush Administration continues to face harsh criticism in
California over perceived inaction regarding the energy crisis, industry
executives appear to be lining up behind Bush's assertion that enhancing the
availability and reliability of the nation's energy supply is the long-term
solution. And they consider creating more supply while maintaining the
transition to a deregulated marketplace crucial, reports the May issue of
Energy Competition Strategy Report, published by Atlanta-based NHI
Publications. One leading utility executive says the solution to the
nation's long-term supply problem is inescapable. "We need to build new
power plants. And those new plants will be built only if we allow the
competitive market to do its job," says William Hecht, chairman, president,
and CEO of Allentown, PA-based PPL Corp. Price caps - which California is
pushing for and Bush opposes - "reduce the incentive to invest in new
production and unnecessarily prolong and exacerbate the current supply and
demand mismatch," Hecht adds. PPL is aggressively developing new power
plants in Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Arizona that
will add more than 4,000 MW of supply. Other members of the Washington,
DC-based Electric Power Supply Association, such as ABB Energy Ventures of
Switzerland and Zeigler Coal Holding of Ashland, KY, are building new,
unregulated merchant power plants. Meanwhile, EPSA is asking Congress to
enact legislation that would allow federal eminent domain for transmission
siting and establish a standardized interconnection policy to make it easier
for generation companies to "get onto the grid." Other highlights of this
month's Energy Competition Strategy Report include: A new energy market
study finds that despite several major setbacks, including California's
ongoing crisis, the energy industry still has its sights set on achieving
full competition. Retail Energy Markets, produced annually by Xenergy, a
Burlington, MA, research firm, is featured in the report and includes a
wealth of data suggesting that, despite restructuring problems, the shift to
competition continues. - Get a detailed look at PowerSolution, a core
technology platform that helps energy companies manage their data by
integrating business applications, external trading partners, and legacy
systems. - Regional utilities are forging loyalties with big commercial and
industrial chains through National Accounts programs that provide
value-added, one-stop customer service. Award-winning Southern Co shares its
secrets to success. - Can fuel cells meet the growing demands for
electricity? A large energy company plans to build, operate, and maintain an
electric generation plant that will use six fuel cells to generate primary
electric supplies. - Evaluate opportunities for investment. Use this process
to assess whether any of 700 technologies spanning the energy value chain
are appropriate investments. Free 3-month trial subscriptions to Energy
