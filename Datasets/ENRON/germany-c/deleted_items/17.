June 24 -- Not so long ago, you could stand at the now infamous tilted E do=
wntown and look north down Electricity Alley -- the thriving nexus of some =
of world's biggest energy trading companies. These days, that stretch is mo=
re like a row of steel and glass dominoes in danger of being tipped by the =
fall of the E logo's namesake: Enron Corp. Energy companies that were proud=
 to show off fast-growing operations and glitzy new trading floors are now =
cutting deeply and concentrating on tangible assets, such as pipelines and =
power plants. A rush to convince investors they're not the next Enron is ta=
king it's toll on the people who held the high-pressure, high-paying jobs o=
n the trading floors of those downtown skyscrapers.

June 24 -- The United States needs to get moving to protect nuclear plants =
and the power grid against future attacks and may need to reorganize the wa=
y government agencies work together, top scientists said on Monday. The cou=
ntry also has "enormous vulnerabilities" to a chemical or biological attack=
, made clear after the Sept. 11 attacks, said a report from the National Ac=
ademy of Sciences, an independent organization that advises the government.=
 One top priority will be working with Russia to keep track of nuclear weap=
ons and radioactive material that could be used either in a nuclear attack,=
 or in a "dirty bomb" that would spread radioactive toxins using a conventi=
onal blast.

Enron Used Reserves To Hide Profits <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/=

June 24 -- Enron Corp. used hidden reserves to conceal up to $1.5 billion i=
n trading profits during the California power crisis, six former executives=
 and managers told the New York Times. In its Sunday edition, the paper sai=
d the reserves would have doubled the now-bankrupt energy trader's profits =
during the California energy crisis in late 2000 and early 2001, at a time =
when politicians were accusing energy companies of profiteering and market =
manipulation. Houston-based Enron also manipulated the reserves -- which he=
ld anywhere from $800 million to $2 billion at times -- to report steady pr=
ofit growth, according to some former executives, the Times said.

June 24 -- Arizona's main electric utilities said Monday the largest wildfi=
re in the state's history so far has not burned into the transmission grid =
carrying power to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Arizona Public Service, the=
 utility subsidiary of Pinnacle West Corp. ((PNW.N)), and the Salt River Pr=
oject, a public power utility, said the fire that has blackened more than 3=
22,000 acres (130,000 hectares) in Arizona's eastern high country has burne=
d close to two 500-kilovolt power lines but they were still operating as of=
 early today. The vast blaze, which started last Tuesday, has come to withi=
n 1-1/2 miles of a high-voltage line that runs from the Cholla power statio=
n in St. Joseph City to the Saguaro power plant north of Tucson, said Damon=
 Gross, a spokesman for Arizona Public Service.

Scientech -- June 24 -- Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv, announ=
ced that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted to approve the merg=
er of the two companies. Today's action leaves approval by the U.S. Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the last necessary to complete the mer=
ger. The merger, proposed in February 2001, has received approvals from the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and has cleared review by the=
 Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. Delaware and =
the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had previous=
ly approved the merger. Dennis Wraase, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepc=
o) president and chief operating officer said, "This is a key milestone in =
the completion of the Pepco-Conectiv merger. With the final state approval =
now in place, the way is cleared for the SEC to act. We are excited about m=
oving to this final stage, as we believe the merger offers significant bene=
fits for customers, shareholders and employees." Analysis: When Pepco and C=
onectiv decided to merge, they wanted to create the largest electricity-del=
ivery company in the mid-Atlantic region with a transmission network servin=
g 1.8 million customers in a 10,000 square-mile area.=20

RiskCenter.com -- June 24 -- Australia is risking hundreds of millions of d=
ollars in export income by not signing the Kyoto protocol on climate change=
, according to the Australian EcoGeneration Association (AEA). AEA, a peak =
group for renewable energy and energy-efficient generators, says figures pr=
ovided by federal and New South Wales research show that Australia will be =
only 5 per cent or less over its Kyoto target by 2008 when the protocol tak=
es effect. As a result, abatement measures to reduce greenhouse gas to 108 =
per cent of 1990 levels by 2008 would not be costly, AEA says. NSW recently=
 announced measures to cut per capita greenhouse emissions by 5 per cent of=
 1990 levels in 2006.
