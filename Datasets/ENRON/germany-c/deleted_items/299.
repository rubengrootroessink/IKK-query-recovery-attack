Hey Chris,

I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you down
too much.

I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in looking
at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and we
are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.  Let me
know.
