Chris,

Hey, Scott is out of the office, so I'm sending this to you.

By the way, I didn't know you were a STAR!!!  I caught you on Nightline last night.  You were right up there with Ken Lay.

Sherry

I guess it helps to attach the deal.

Scott,

Can you extend the following deal to 3/31/00?  This contract had a small amount of activity for 2/00 and 3/00.

Thanks,

Sherry
