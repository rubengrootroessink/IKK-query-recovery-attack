IT through Concord is available for 90,000dth between Niagara and Leidy, 100,000 dth. between Pendleton and Leidy.

We are posting 50,000 dth excess injection on either the East or West Side but we have already seen interest from shippers with primary rights to use that space.  Therefore, I'd advise against IAS returns and excess injections.

Excess withdrawals are fine system wide and IAS advances are available for 100,000 dth.

I also want to remind you that our Firm Transport Open Season between Ellisburg and Leidy expires Wednesday, October 31st.  Please call your firm sales representative for more detail or visit our website.

What a great game between Flutie and Johnson, and I heard Dallas won.  Any given Sunday!
