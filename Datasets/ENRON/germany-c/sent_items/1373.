I WANT TO GO.  Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.  I'm almost positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).  You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat.

I'm going to see Harry Potter this week.  It's two one half hours long.   You
want to go?   Barb does not want to go with me.    I'll come up to Houston to
see it.  Need to pick up a honey cured ham anyway.  If you do not want to go, no
sweat.   I was thinking about going tonight anyway.
