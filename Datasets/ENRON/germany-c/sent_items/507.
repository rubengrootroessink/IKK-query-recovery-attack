Subject: appalachian  producers
We (EES) have  been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on  actually paying the post-petition pieces?   Besides Dominion,  we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,   Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio  Gas.    Are these on your list to review some day like you  are doing Dominion?     A few producers have called  wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to  forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to  wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these  pipes/ldc's.   It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to  happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working  on it now.    
 
Also, only one  company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just  being split by 31 days.    I figured if the producer disputed  his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more  accurate.  
 
Any comments  will be helpful.  Thanks.
