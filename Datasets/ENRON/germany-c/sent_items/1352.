And you thought I didn't have anything ready.  I sent this to Paul yesterday, he said "I'll keep it and see were to fit you in, you should have come when I asked you to"

I guess he's unhappy with me.

I like to have all options open. Look for jobs and work on getting something
lined up. If a company really wants you... they will wait for you. Lot's of
times they will pay you the cash that you are waiting for at your current
company... severance/bonus... etc.

We are looking for folks.. you can send me your resume. They need traders,
capacity folks, schedulers, and of course my errand boy too. Finally, we are
starting to expand since bankruptcy is behind us!!!

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.
What would you have me do?

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a
change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job,
or activly look for a new job?

   Do you want a job up here in DC? You could make a ton of money, ingrid
   could
   stay home with the kid... and we could go to TACO Bell for lunch.
