Susan,

I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event.

CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi, Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend.

later
chris
