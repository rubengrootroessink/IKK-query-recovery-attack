Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.
