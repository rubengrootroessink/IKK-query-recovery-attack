Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.
