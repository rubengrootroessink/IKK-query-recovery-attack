This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it.  I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.  I actually think a summary thingy, sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week, would be easier to look at.  Give me your thoughts.
