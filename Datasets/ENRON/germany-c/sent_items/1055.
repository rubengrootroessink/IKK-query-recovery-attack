Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Fuel Cells 2000 Unveils New Career Center

     Fuel Cells 2000 has launched an online resource center for individuals
interested in pursuing a professional career in the fuel cell industry.  The
resource was created in response to the hundreds of emails and letters
inquiring about employment opportunities in the growing fuel cell job
market. The Fuel Cell Career Center
(www.fuelcells.org/careercenter/fccenterhome.html) provides information in
three separate areas of activity - Education, Employment Opportunities, and
Professional Development - to service every stage of the job search, from
laying the groundwork with a fuel cell-focused degree to training and
workshops at the professional level. * The Educational Activities section
includes background information for students interested in pursuing an
undergraduate or graduate degree involving fuel cell technologies,
internship opportunities and information on curriculum materials and
educational kits for teachers. * For job seekers, the Employment
Opportunities section of the Career center has listings and links to
websites offering jobs within the fuel cell industry, company profiles to
learn more about individual fuel cell companies and their activities, and
will soon have job posting boards for companies to display employment
listings. * For Professional Activities, Fuel Cells 2000 has compiled a
listing of workshops and seminars to provide opportunities for information
exchange and networking in the fuel cell industry as well as links to
Professional Associations related to engineering, fuel cells and renewable

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

TRENTON/BLACKRIVER "BOOM" IN WEST VIRGINIA

Land and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acres

Trenton/Blackriver production found in the state, was in a well drilled in
1962 by Tidewater Oil Company adjoining our property. We need an industry
partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000
acres would also make a great gas storage field.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.
