Supposedly, the same material is covered in either 2-day, 4-week, or 6-week
sessions.  Our options for classes are the weekend of Mar 23 for the 2-day
(goes from 9 to 3 Sat and another couple hours on Sun); Apr 16 - May 6 for
the 4-week (not so good cuz it ends awfully close to our due date); and Feb
20 - Mar 25 for the 6-week (this one meets 7-9 on Wed nites).

What are your thoughts?
