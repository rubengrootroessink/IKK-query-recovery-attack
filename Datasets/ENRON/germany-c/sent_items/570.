I hope you are getting somewhere because this is getting annoying.  First he wouldn't send me anything, now they are all over it when he should have just sent me something to begin with.

Chris:

We seem to be on track with a GISB for EES, but little progress has been
made with ENA.  Is Stacy Dickson the right contact for ENA?

I have asked my legal department about this a couple of times and I'm not
sure if we have sent you anything.  Would you please just send me a GISB
agreement out of your shop.  I see you have spoken to EES already.

Thanks
