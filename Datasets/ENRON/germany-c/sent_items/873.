Cullen and Dykman (attorneys for Boston Gas Company) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas.  They also made one other change, they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1.

They will be sending the revised document to me.  I will deliver it to you for your approval.
