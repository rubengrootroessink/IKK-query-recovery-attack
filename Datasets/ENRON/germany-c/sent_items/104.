I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!

What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?

Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married - yet) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.  I'm reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down.
