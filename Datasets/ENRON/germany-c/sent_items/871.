Steve, everything looks good with one exception.  The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284.  I won't find out until Monday.  You review and approve it, keep it on your desk, and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday.  Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval.

By the way, Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray.

Chris: 
Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)
Thanks for all your help on this.
