HEY WOMAN!!!!   What the heck are you doing?

I did make it back.  I actually came in most of last week.  I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment.  I have this strong urge to go out and spend  money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now.

We don't really know much about the New Company right now.  I'm actually on the estate team anyway.  I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon, Sylvia Pollen, Robin Barbe, and Kathy Kelly.  The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won.  I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.  I think I know of a couple of people that have left; David Jones (black guy in origination - real nice guy too) starts working for TXU in Dallas today, Darren Farmer (Texas Desk)  is going to AEP.

Chris,

Did you ever make it back? How are people now that the bid winner has been
announced? Better I hope. Maybe it will seem like the wheels will start
rolling on the new business/company.

Hey, I just saw your email.  I'm still here.  I'm moving my stuff from 6 to
5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.  I may
or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.  I'm probably
leaving early today too.  I may actually take the first week of Jan off
too.

How are you?  I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.  I'm glad
you have something.  Don't be upset if I don't return your email for
awhile.  I'll be on vacation.

Later Gator
