Have you alerted the Settlements person handling New Power?

Subject:	Trco/New Power capacity for Sept 2001

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.
