I know, life is all about choices, Jean or lawyers, Jean or lawyers, Jean or Ingrid and a screaming kid???  Hmm, my choice seems much simpler now that I look at it like this.

Hey team!  Man have I been waiting for this day.

I have a meeting at 9:00 AM this morning.  It's a meeting with lawyers so it
is very possible that it will go through lunch.  Don't wait for me if you
can't get ahold of me.  I hope to be there cause I wanna see JEAN, the light
of my life.  Scott--- HANDS OFF JACK!

Later
