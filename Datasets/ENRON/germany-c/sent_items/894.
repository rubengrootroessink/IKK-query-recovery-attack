Lunch on Friday sounds great.

Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy.  He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from Enron and an offer letter from Dynegy.

Maybe I'll see you there!!!   A fellow can always hope.  Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either.  I bet she doesn't marry me now.
