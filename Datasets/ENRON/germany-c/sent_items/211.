	listed below is my understanding of the steps involved in the wire process.
	.	fill out cash request
	.	.  get mark to mark value from phil
	.	email prepayment amount to priscilla along with reliant prepay cash request form
	.	sign the cash request form, attach the wire request and mark to mark documentation and 
		   put on ed's desk for signature
[Germany, Chris]  make copy of the wire request and supporting documents for contract folder.
	.	take to the 10th floor to susan felton


	please correct as needed.

	thanks
