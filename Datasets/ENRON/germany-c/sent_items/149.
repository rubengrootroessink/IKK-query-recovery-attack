Just a reminder to access the Performance Assessment System and complete your self-assessment by Monday, May 20, 2002.  Supervisors should complete their employee assessments by May 24, 2002.  After May 24, PAS will be closed for the administration and distribution of quarterly retention payments.

To access PAS, go to the HR Global Applications website by clicking on the link below and login using your GIS identification.  If you don't have your GIS ID and/or password, you can have it automatically looked up on the front page of the site or contact the HRGIM helpdesk at (713) 853-5666.  The helpdesk is open Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
