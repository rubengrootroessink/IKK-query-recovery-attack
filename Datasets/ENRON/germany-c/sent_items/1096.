Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:  males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

    The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

    The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.
