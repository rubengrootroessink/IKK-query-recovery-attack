Yesterday I asked you how to go about paying an invoice from Peoples Energy for $1,380.44.  The charges are for a license fee, a customer service, and an outstanding balance of $983.75.  I found out this morning that we are using this system to do nominations for Enovate.  Eric Boyt said he thought the Enron people managing the Enovate deal are Beth Jenkins and J.O. Pagan.  Should I forward this invoice to Beth or J.O.?
