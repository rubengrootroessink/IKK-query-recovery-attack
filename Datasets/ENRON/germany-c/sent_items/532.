I have a bill from Cingular Wireless in my iPayit account.  I called Cingular and asked them when this bill was last paid.  They said before Dec 2nd.  I told them they should cancel the service.  Don't know if they are going to do that or not.

8:25 am Per Lisa at Cingular WIreless, this account has been cancelled.
