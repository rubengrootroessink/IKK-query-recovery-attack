Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you constantly rejected my advances.

AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.

I didn't say anything bad... so when's the wedding??

Robbie is fine... he got a new bed last weekend... yippee!!It's delivered on
Saturday... can't wait to try it out. Last bed was held up by phone books.

Cats are good... starting to run through the house... forgetting they lost
their claws.

Work is slow... so teaching myself some NE transport.

Be good to Ingrid... she needs your love and support!!

Hey woman!  What are you doing talking to my pregnant chic?  I going to
tell her that anything bad you said about me is a lie.

AND YES, all I do is goof off.  What else is there to do?

How's your boy doing?  How are the cats?  How's the job?  How old are you?
