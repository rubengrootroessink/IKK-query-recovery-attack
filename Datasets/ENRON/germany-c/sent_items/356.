re lunch.  i can do any day next week except mon or tues.  and any day the following week.

actually, they made me an offer on monday, 4/01 and i left on holiday on tuesday.  i did go in that tues am to see if i could get more $ from them, of course the pay/bo is less than here.  they didn't think there was anything they could do.

got back into office on wed.  played phone tag all wed.  they called me thurs [yesterday] right before lunch and said could give me a very nice sign on bonus...but nothing more to my base pay.  thought hard about it, and decided to accept, which i did yesterday.  they sent a letter over this pm and then went in to talk to jesus.

i am part of the liquidation pool, but do not feel comfortable at all that they are really going to pay me.  you know, if we sell $3 B you get xxx.  but there is no way we are going to sell exactly $3B.  and you have NO IDEA what you get if they sell $2 B or $3.5B.... and there is way too much loosiness involved in all of this, no letter stating anything, plus no trust on my part, that i don't think they will come thru.  and of course, now you have the SEC thing going on.  grrrr.
