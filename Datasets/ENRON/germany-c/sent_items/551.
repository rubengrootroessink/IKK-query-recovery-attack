Greetings,

I signed up for the MS150 bicycle ride from Houston to Austin on April 20-21.  One requirement is a donation of $300 to the National MS Society.  I hope to raise this minimum amount through contributions from colleagues, friends, and family; thus the purpose of this email.  With your help, you can help me raise funds to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small and I will provide you a receipt if necessary.

I've been training for two (2) months and it's been fun.  I've been biking off and on for a few years now but this is my first big two-day race.  And I look forward to the actual ride.

=================================================================================

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.

I'll be glad to share with you my progress and any (exaggerated) road bike stories.  Thanks.
