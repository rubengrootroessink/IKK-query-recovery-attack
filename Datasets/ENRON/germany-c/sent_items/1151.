Suzanne is here.  She said you and her are doing some Manual work this weekend.  You and I are breaking up for the weekend but I need to get my car back first.  Maybe after we go to the movie.

PS  Scott said the resteraunt to go to in Round Top is "Royers".  He said you go shop for antique crap and then go eat at this place.
