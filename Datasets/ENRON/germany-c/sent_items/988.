Hey, I just saw your email.  I'm still here.  I'm moving my stuff from 6 to 5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.  I may or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.  I'm probably leaving early today too.  I may actually take the first week of Jan off too.  

How are you?  I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.  I'm glad you have something.  Don't be upset if I don't return your email for awhile.  I'll be on vacation.

Later Gator
