Just to give all some background.

We would like to understand the business plan for ENA, so that we can plan staffing, etc.  For example, in Retail, the business plan is to sale the books of business by May 31.  That allows us to make plans for each functional area to determine staffing gaps, etc.

We are looking for the same on Wholesale.

Chris - Can you help us with that?  If not, we will need to reschedule the meeting.

Let me know.

Brenda
