Wait just a minute.  Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite?  Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!   We are poorer than college students now.  I think you should send us an invite anyway.  Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.  At least I could get drunk.  So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?  I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.  

Those are fantastic grades.  You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.  I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?  MBA?

Its good to hear about Alicia.  Is she going to grad school?

I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.  We move in together at the end of Feb.  I'm nervous about that.  I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.  I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.  I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.

So you guys are just playing the good ole waiting game now, huh? Enron is the new favorite media topic. Criminal investigations out the wazoo. Shredding documents....that's a major no no. Anyhow, at least you've made it so far. So how are you doing other than work? Didn't you say that you were getting married? What's the deal with that?
As far as I am concerned, yes I am still in love. Our wedding is on March 23 on Clearwater Beach, FL. It should be pretty cool. School is awesome. I got a 3.83 last term. Hopefully I'll be able to pull off a 4.0 this time. I saw Alicia Perkins over Christmas. I drove over to Daytona Beach, FL to hang out with her. She is doing very well. She's working for her Dad's real estate company. Anyhow, I'll talk to you later. Take care.
