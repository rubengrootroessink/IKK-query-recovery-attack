Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?

?	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Thanks
