Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Vickie
