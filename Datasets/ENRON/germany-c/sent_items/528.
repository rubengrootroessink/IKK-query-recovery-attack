Same thing as yesterday.  I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.  I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room.  You should have received this yesterday afternoon.

Thanks
chris

Ted, thanks for your help on the account number.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/5/02.  This is a negotiated IT deal that I did with Bob Fleming in the Bid Room.

Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.

Thanks
chris
