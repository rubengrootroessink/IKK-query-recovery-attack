For the 6th, I borrowed 19,903 dth from EGHP (deal 1158684) and I must pay the all the gas back by Friday (deal 1158685).  Since we are borrowing the gas first, we should path this gas on contract # EGHP IT Loaning - 001.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

These two new offered service have been setup for Egan Hub.  


I have called to have the server bounced.  It will take about 15-20 minutes.  Then you can set up the deals in Sitara.  

Let me know if you have any problems.

Thank you.
