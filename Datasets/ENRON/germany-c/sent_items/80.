I'm working on my contact list.  It looks like I'll have better luck after lunch.  FP&L asked me to call back after lunch.  Judy said that Scott Neal just doesn't want to talk about it till after trading.

Interesting note (and I'm keeping track of my notes)  AEP will not buy gas from Enron.  I spoke to Elsa Villarreal (works for Houston Pipeline).  She called Todd Lambert in her Columbus office and Todd told Elsa that AEP will not buy gas from Enron.

I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day.
