Hi team.  I apologize for the short notice but I need to take off this afternoon.  I will have my cell phone.  The number is 713-557-5095.  Most of my time will be spent waiting around in the Dr.'s office just to have a 5 min chat, so feel free to call me if you need anything.

I also plan on taking Monday off.  Robin will be handling the physical activity.
