I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=
al make sure that liability to Enron under the fuel  management deal be ful=
ly understood.  We are doing what we can to minimize penalties or costs, bu=
t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=
w your thoughts.

Regards,
Ed  =09

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.
