The end date on #21 (contract # 58654) is 4/30/2005.  The demand charge on #21 and #17 is $3.145 per month.  Also, ACA changed from $.0022 to $.0021 on ALL the CGLF transport.

Chris,

For path #17 and #21, could you tell me what the demand charges should be?  The two are different but are the same locations.  Also, we have #21 through mar-2005, structuring thinks it should be through Apr-2005.


Thanks

Kam
