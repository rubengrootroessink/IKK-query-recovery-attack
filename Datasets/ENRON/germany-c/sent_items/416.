Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

Ruth,
Have you spoken with Chris? He has been leading the Dominion team from a
commercial perspective and has been coordinating with EES.
