I am disappointed to announce the resignation of Cindy Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Employee Relations, effective July 15, 2002.  After nearly 25 years with Enron, Cindy has decided to leave to assist her husband in his trucking and transportation business.  Her commitment and enthusiasm, even during these difficult times, have been inspiring and will be missed.
Robert Jones, managing director in Human Resources, will assume Cindy's responsibilities and join Enron's Management Committee.  Robert joined Enron in 1980 and has held numerous managerial positions.  Prior to Enron's bankruptcy, Robert led Human Resources for Enron Wholesale Services.  Robert was instrumental in developing the retention and severance plan that was ultimately approved by the creditors' committee and the court.  His experience and leadership will be invaluable as we move forward in our restructuring efforts.
