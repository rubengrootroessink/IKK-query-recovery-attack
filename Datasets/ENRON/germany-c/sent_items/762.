Congratulations.  Of course I won't be able to give you any more candy on valentine's day.  But maybe someone over there will take care of that.

All-

I just wanted to let everyone know that today will be my last day with Enron.  I have accepted a position with Duke Energy which should be a challenging and enriching experience.  I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has helped me along the way while I've been here.  It's been a pleasure working with all of you.  Please feel free to contact me at this new email address: angiez_1@hotmail.com or call me anytime on my cell phone at 832.656.5948.

Best Regards-
Angie Zeman
