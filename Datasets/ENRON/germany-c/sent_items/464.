Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.

This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 =
$32,700.00
			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 =
$957,000.00
					Total Prepayment
$989,700.00

I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included
the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have
someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the
worksheet please.
