I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the
rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab
to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary
purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any
information that identifies the wire.

Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me to
add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.
That's what I plan to do.
