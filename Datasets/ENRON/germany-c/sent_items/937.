We don't have a deadline.  Our lawyers are scattered pretty thin.  What would probably happen is that you guys might show me a bid for some of the capacity, then we would have to talk to the pipelines and see what they want to do.

What is the deadline for the list of transport that y'all are releasing?? We
are starting to run some numbers.

I'm in class all day, so just give me an e-mail back.

Thank you!!!
