good luck.  when is comes to daycares.  it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there.  another place you could look is   st. andrews presb.  at buffalo speedway and bissonet.  when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing.  it is or was an accredited facility.

that facility really didn't have much of an academic program.  at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later,.  it better not to move kids alot.
