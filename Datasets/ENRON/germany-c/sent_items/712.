Just wanted to let all of you know that there's going to be another wedding
in the future!

Brent and I got engaged on Thursday night.  He completely surprised me with
a beautiful ring and a nice dinner at Mark's after spending an hour at the
Museaum of Fine Arts.  We're planning to have the wedding in Tulsa next
March, but have not set a definative date yet.

It's been a wonderful few days and I'm slowly getting used to having jewerly
on that finger.  (After a few scratches, I must admit.)

I just thought everyone should know since I've been harrassed about this
event for quite some time now.  :)  Hope all is well everyone!

Angie
