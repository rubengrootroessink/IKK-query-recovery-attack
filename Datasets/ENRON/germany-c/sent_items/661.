Robin is at home.  She tried to call you this morning and I suggested that I just send you an email of some of the items she wanted to discuss and you could call her when you have time.

Melissa, Daniel, didn't know if you had her number on file.  Her number is 713-721-0709.

GELP - Gordonsville Energy, L.P. (deal 599653)

CALP - Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership  (deal 599646)
