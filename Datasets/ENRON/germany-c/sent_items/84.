Hey team.  I had every intention of being there this morning (even though I was running late) but my daughter was awake and  I couldn't resist spending time with her.  I'll be there next week.

Guys,
Joe informed me he cannot attend tomorrow AM and I'm assuming Chris is out until further notice.
Scott and Lindsey - please let me know if you plan to attend.  I'm inclined to go ahead if you both can make it, or cancel if one of you cannot.

Thx!
Bill
