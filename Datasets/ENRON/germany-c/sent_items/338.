1201382	TXU Fuel Company				96096343
This deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0.
