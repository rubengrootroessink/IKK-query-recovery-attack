I believe CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company should be added.  Per Sylvia's notes, the contact their is Tim Spurlin.  His number is 713-230-7427.  I have not contacted CMS about being added to the list.

Eric, Vicky:

Attached please find the revised MCV potential bidder list:

 << File: Contacts for MCV Auction.xls >> 

The document is also saved in the following folder:  o:\gas Structuring\Bankruptcy Folder\MCV\

This is includes the additional 16 companies that Ed suggested be kept on the list.  I have called all of the companies they all expressed interest, with the exception of TransCanada which sold its gas marketing company.
