I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?

I zeroed out the 33000/d for March - let me know if you hear anything about this deal. 

Thanks

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.
