Just all outstanding unpaid amounts.  it mite be easier for me to just go through the file and not worry about the copies since we are on the same floor.  I just need you to tell me what is outstandind and what isn't.

I would like to get copies of all the outstanding Dominion invoices please.  I don't need the big producer allocation statements, just the invoices showing all the demand, parking, and variable cost.  If you guys have files where the invoices are, let me know and I'll just go through the files myself and forget the copies.

Dominion sent us a large packet with information about all the contracts and some producer information.  Let me know if you want to see the producer information.

Thanks
