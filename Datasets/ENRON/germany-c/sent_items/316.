I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.

1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.

2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

Just a thought.
