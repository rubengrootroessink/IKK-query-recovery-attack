Iroquois is offering to market ENA's capacity for $1.00 (see attachements at the bottom of this email).  Doesn't sound like a bad deal to me

Chris

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity.  In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper).  So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee.  What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached.  Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper.  Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.
