Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.
