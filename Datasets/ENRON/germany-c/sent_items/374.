Unify shows some production in November and December on CNG Appalachia.  Small producer.  We owe $539.35 for November and $338.40 for December.  Unless there is value we are not paying December production and of course we are not paying November.  The points on CNG are #4281001 and $4371101.  Let me know what I can do - maybe give the customer my number to call.

Chris, a woman from Elvis Energy is calling about some unpaid invoices, but I don't know anything about this project.  Kay Mann suggested that I contact you for possible help.
