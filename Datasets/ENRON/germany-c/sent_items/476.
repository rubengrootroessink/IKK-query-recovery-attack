Hi Chris,

My name is Joan Morgan and I do the capacity release here at Keyspan
(Boston Gas).  Next month and thereafter when you do the assignment of
the Iroquois contract (volume 35,465 dth), instead of using Liz Danehy
as the bidder contact, will you use my name?  The telephone number and
fax will remain the same.  My e-mail address is
jmorgan@keyspanenergy.com.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions concerning this.

Joan Morgan
