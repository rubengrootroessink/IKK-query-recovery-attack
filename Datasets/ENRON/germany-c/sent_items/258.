OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.
