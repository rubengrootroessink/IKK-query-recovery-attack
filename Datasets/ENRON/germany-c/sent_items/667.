No		Comment		File

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP
(tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools
are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a
specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used
as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP
Pool meters are not.
