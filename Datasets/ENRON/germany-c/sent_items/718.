I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!  We spent our first
night together Friday night.  Of course we both have colds / allergies real
bad so it was a sniffly experience.  It will take some getting used to
thats for sure.  She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her
pregnant heart.
