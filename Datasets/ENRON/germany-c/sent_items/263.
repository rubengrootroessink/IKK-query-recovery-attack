Susan just called me and said she is the CAO for ENA and she should be the one to sign off on the wire requests.  I didn't know.

I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.
 
Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.  Why wouldn't that be you instead?

Subject: Manual Wire/Check Requests


Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug
