I didn't send this yet and I have not spoken with Cinergy either.  Would you call Jackie at Cinergy please.  Also, the scheduling contact at TXU is David Avila, his number is 214-875-9792, his aol id is avila4404.  I gave David the upstream information.  He said that for the weekend the downstream k# is 1901.
