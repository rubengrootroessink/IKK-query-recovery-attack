Let me know what she says.

You better believe Dynegy is better than bankruptcy.  Hang in there.

Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I
don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than
bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But
I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked
her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.

   Hey Chris,

   I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you
   down
   too much.

   I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in
   looking
   at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and
   we
   are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.
   Let me
   know.
