Baby is due May 7th but my womand is HUGH and I don't think she's gonna make it.  Kathy just told me.  I'm happy for you.  Did you listen to the retention talk first or were you already out the door mentally?

I wanna do lunch with you.  When can you pencil me in?  I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday.
