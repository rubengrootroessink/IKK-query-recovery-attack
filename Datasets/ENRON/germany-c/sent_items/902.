Hey, just wanted to give you a heads up......we had an EES employee meeting this afternoon.  Christi Finelli (our contract lady) said she got a call from Heidi Griffith and they they being Heidi & Jim Javins) were wanting to know if you were still here or not.  Not sure if they were asking because of a job opportunity they might have for you or if it was out of concern but I just wanted to let you know.  They are both with AES now, same place where Susan Weison ended up.
