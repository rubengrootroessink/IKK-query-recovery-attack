I don't use the start menu to access my pipeline EBB which is what I think this is.  But I do go to this website on the internet
	==>    http://escript.dom.com/

to access the Dominion EBB.  Dominion used to be called CNG.

My name is Bryan DeLuca, and I am with the Application Integration Team.  We are doing a routine maintenance and are wondering if you are still using the Energy Scheduling Weblinks CNG program? You will find this program under the start menu \ programs \ Business Applications.

Please reply back to this email letting us now if you ARE, or ARE NOT using the Energy Scheduling Weblinks Cng program anymore. If you are not using this program anymore it will be removed.

Thank you for your time,
Bryan A. DeLuca
Application Integration Team
