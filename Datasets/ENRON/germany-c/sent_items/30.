Weekly Natural Gas Storage 

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has updated weekly estimates of
natural gas in underground storage for the United States and three regions.  The
weekly data are currently available on EIA's website at:
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/ngs.html

The web site contains the most recent estimates and provides a link to a
spreadsheet of prior weekly storage estimates. The estimates will be released
regularly between 10:30 a.m. and 10:40 a.m. (Eastern time) on Thursdays, except
for certain weeks with Federal holidays. A schedule for holiday weeks through
calendar year 2002 is available at
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/schedule.html.
