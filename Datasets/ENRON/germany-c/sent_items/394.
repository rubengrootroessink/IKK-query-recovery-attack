HEY!!!  What's up in your life?  My woman is getting bigger every day.  I wonder if this little sucker is going to look anything like Duff?  We've been living in sin together since the last week of Feb.  So far so good but I do like my solitude.

I'm thinking about buying a new car.  BUT I'm almost always thinking of buying a new car.  I drove all the toyota suv's the chevy suv's, nissan and ford.  My favorite out of the pack is the ford explorer - GO FIGURE.  ITs more comfy for my tush!
