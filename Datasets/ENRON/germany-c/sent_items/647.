Shemin, Kathryn (EES Logistics) is going to send me some information on EES. I'm going to summarize the date for ENA and EES and resend this email, hopefully within the next hour or so.

Chris,
I need you to lead the effort to work with/through legal to fully explore our alternatives and then recommend a solution to resolve.  PwC and Weil probably need to be informed of your efforts.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Hi Chris,
I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
Thanks,
Shemin
