We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new.  Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months.  I had a jury duty summons this morning.  I didn't get picked and we got out at 1:00 PM.  Sell my truck yet?

Hey Bub,

Did you get a raise going to the new company?
