Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.

Hi Jon.

We just spoke on the phone and I work with Ruth Concannon and Maria Garza on the Enron Estate Team.

Offer #20275
Released to Enserco
Term	4/8/02 to 4/30/02
MDQ	20,0000
demand rate  $1.30

Please call me when you get a chance at 713-853-4743.
