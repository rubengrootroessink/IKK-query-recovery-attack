I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to sell.

Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and Nov-1year.

Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.

Thanks
