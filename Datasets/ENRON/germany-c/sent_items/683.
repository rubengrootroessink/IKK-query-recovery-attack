I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

Deal 1143983 on Natural Gas Pipeline Company.

thanks

I contacted Mary Ellenberger.  She indicated we did receive the gas but have not paid.  I suggested that she contact you via email.

Have we determined if the facts in the letter are correct?  I've confirmed that if the facts are true, the payment needs to be made.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Attached is a demand letter w/ short time fuse.  Counterparty wants payment for post-petition gas delivered to Enron.  Please advise if you need commercial involvement.  Thanks
