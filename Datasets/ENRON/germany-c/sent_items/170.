Hey everyone - I am in the process of finalizing a SURPRISE 30th birthday
PARTY for my lovely wife, Meredith.
I will get the final info out next week...but just wanted to drop you all a
note so that you could pencil it in your calendars.

When:  Friday May 31st   8:00ish
Where:  Spotlight Karaoke - Westheimer @ Fountainview
       (we will have a private room - with our own DJ -  holding up to 50
people, so you will be able to sing
               on the small stage or on the big stage in the main bar).

Please feel free to pass the word around, everyones invited ... but
hopefully we can keep it a surprise for Meredith.
More details next week.

Thanks, Jim.
