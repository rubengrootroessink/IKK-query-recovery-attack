According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.

I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.  I'm out for the rest of the day.

Thanks
