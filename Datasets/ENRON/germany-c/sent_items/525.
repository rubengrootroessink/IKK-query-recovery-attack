Shemin, just give me a call when you are ready.  I'll let Wade know and we will come to your office.

Wade,
I am meeting K. Higgason for lunch at 12:30, so can we please meet at
1:30, or 1:45?

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00
or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some
of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Thanks

inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed
meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed
effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some
cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool.
