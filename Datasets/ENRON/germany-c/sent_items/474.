I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

                                         deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Kay

in place.  I'm concerned about the 1st because all the money needs to be
wired tomorrow.  At this point, I believe Dominion should supply the gas
for April at the contract price regardless.

>                    Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc
(successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth
per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to
The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I
prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion
was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying
any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson
Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.
