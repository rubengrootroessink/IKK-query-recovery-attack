Maybe we can go drinking too.  That would be fun.  I'll be at your house around 10:30 or 11 tonight.

Funny.  No.  I didn't feel guilty about the garage sale, that's why I was
annoyed - being notified at 10:00 at night GRRRRRRR.  I do feel guilty
about you doing all this work.  So I'm going with you, I pay for the gas
and the twinkies.

   I would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible.
   Plus
   it make me feel like I'm doing part of the work.  I just might come up
   and
   spend the night tonight.  Be there around 10:30 or 11.

       You win!   How you want your $20.   How about in dimes, unrolled.
      Don
      said he  would go, but kinda hee hawing around.   I'm going so I
   don't
      have
      to worry about Bonner having to wait on Don.   No sense in you going.
      Just a quick trip up and back.   I'll pick me up a book to listen to
   on
      the
      way.
