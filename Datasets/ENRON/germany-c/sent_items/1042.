It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?

So what are you doing this weekend?

Hey,

If some where down the line they want to excerise this right, then we worry
about it.  I say we worry about it for the next  five years then let whom ever
has  a problem with this hire a lawyer for the rest.   What you say BUB.  Lets
just get this over with and move on with life.   See Ya.

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.
