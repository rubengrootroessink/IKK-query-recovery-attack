>    A boss and two of his employees are on their way to a meeting. Walking
> through a park, they find a miracle lamp. They rub it and suddenly a genie
> appears.
>    The genie says: "Normally, the one who frees me, has three wishes free.
> Now, you are three persons, so everyone of you has one wish." The first
> employee yells: "Me first, ME FIRST!!!" and expresses his wish: "I would
> like to be on the Bahamas, on a very fast yacht, and have no more worries"
> And pfffffff, he is away.
>    Now the second employee yells: "Me next, ME NEXT" and he expresses his
> wish: "I would like to be in the Caribbean, along with the prettiest girls
> of the world, and an inexhaustible source of exotic cocktails." And
> pfffffff, he is away.
>    "And what is your wish?" the genie asks the boss.
>    And the boss replies:
>    "I want these two idiots to be back in office after lunch!!!"
>    And the moral of this story: Always let your boss speak first!!!!
