Ed has signed off on the agreement you gave me yesterday evening.  Should I send this straight to Boston Gas's outside counsel or should I send it to Melanie Gray?

Chris: 
Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)
Thanks for all your help on this.
