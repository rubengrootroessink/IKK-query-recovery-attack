Did she show you her tatoo?

I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  Your the boss, what do you think?

I am so glad you are going.  Here is the scoop.  Think about your flights
and let me know.  If you would rather drive w/ Berk and I and another guy
that works here, you are welcome!!!
But, you know you will never catch as many fish as Judy.  She is just
amazing.  No one can touch her!


May 2-4 -       Fly to the lodge (Corpus) on Wednesday afternoon or evening
(May 2nd).

                         There is fishing  on Thursday  (all day)  and

back.
