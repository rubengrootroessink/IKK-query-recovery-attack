I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.  I'm making the following assumptions;
	1.  ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002
	2.  Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months
	3.  Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day

So far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.  I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.

The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.  Phil, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.  Sounds good to me.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls

 

The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant, our current cash balance with Reliant, how much gas we have purchased, and what price we used.
I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week.  I also plan to copy Phil, Robin, and Margaret.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls

 

Eric, Doug, Phil,   let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday.
