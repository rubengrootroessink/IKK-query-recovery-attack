Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.  Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.  Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.  Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation.
