Subject:	Peoples Energy invoice

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Thanks
