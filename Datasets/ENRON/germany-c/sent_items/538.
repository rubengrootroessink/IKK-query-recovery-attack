Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails.  I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us.  We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available.

I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all.
