I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.
 
Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.  This was just in case you had the same question.

Hey guys,
Don wants to know why we have to pay Dominion for the full month.  Is it a contractual obligation?  Can we just pay them for a week or two?
 
Please let me know ASAP.
 
Thanks,
