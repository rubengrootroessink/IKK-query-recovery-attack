Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday and
Sunday for intraday rates.

I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much volume?

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.

Thanks

   Nothing is set up.  Did you call in?

   Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
   on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
   would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
   notes.

   Thanks
