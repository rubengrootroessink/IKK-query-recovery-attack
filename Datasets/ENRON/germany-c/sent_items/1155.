It was nice of you to put thought and effort into those reviews.  Even if the process seems like a waste of time, you did your part!
I feel so blah today.  I'm tired and sad and have cramps.  I almost turned around and went home when I was on my way to work, but I have so much to do.  I'm hoping to just work quietly today, get my mind off my troubles, and get some things off my plate.
And I love my kitty cat.  He's my precious boo-boo. 
xoxo,   ii

   Did you finish all but your own?  Saving the best for last? 
   I guess you finished at 11:30.  Am I right?
