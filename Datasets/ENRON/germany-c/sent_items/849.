I'm at my new desk on the 4th floor.  I'm here, my computer is here, but it looks like my phone has not been activated.  So I don't know when I'll be able to call and aggravate you.  Email aggravations just aren't the same.

Please try to think of some of our old conversations, especially those where you would look up and to the left uttering "oh my GOD!".
