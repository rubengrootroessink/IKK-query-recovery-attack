She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.

She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.

Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.

Thanks.
