No buddy.  Thank you.  And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too.  My treat.  Maybe I'll invite my work wife, Judith.  I'm thinking about
	Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ
	Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers
	Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby
	Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.

I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway.
