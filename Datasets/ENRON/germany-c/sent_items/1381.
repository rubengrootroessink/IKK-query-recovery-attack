On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

thanks
