Chris,
 
So do I pay the invoice or not.  I'm a little confused from all the emails.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.
Lynn

Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over.  Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him.  I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below.

I'm familar with the item. It sounds like enovate should pay it if it is enovate access. 
Is this taken care of or do I need to call someone to pay it?  Let me know 
Richard

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
Thanks
