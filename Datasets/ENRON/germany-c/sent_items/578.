Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Scottie
