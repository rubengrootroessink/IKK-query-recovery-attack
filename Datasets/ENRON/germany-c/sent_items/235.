Buddy!!!    I'm still here and stll kicking.  You know I have a baby on the way.  Its due May 7th.  My woman is getting BIG!!  GOOD LORD!!  Enron is still going strong.  Looks like I'll be here for at least a year but you never know.  I bet you guys miss me too, calling up, asking dumb questions, falling off horses at the shipper meeting.  

How's life for you?
