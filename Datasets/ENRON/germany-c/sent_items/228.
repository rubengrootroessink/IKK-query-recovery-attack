I don't see you on MSN.  My time free's up after 9:00 in the morning.  Tallahassee has to call on the swing gas by then.

Chris,

Do you know anything about these contracts?  To the extent that you can define roughly the shape of this deal, I would appreciate it.

Let's talk about this Tuesday when you free up.

Thanks,
Mike
