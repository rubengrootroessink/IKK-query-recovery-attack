The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.



 


 

The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies.
