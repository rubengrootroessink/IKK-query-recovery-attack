You are my hero.

Hi, Scott!

Thanks for thinking of me.  Lia already called me and I contacted the guy at
Shell.  They're looking for someone to do refined products marketing and
transportation.  I'm not experienced in that and frankly not very interested
in starting something completely new in the energy business.  I'm too old!!

Hope things are going well at UBS.  Say hi to everyone for me.  I sent Andy
an email several weeks ago but haven't heard back.  I know you guys are busy
trying to get everything set up.  Good luck!

Take care,

Susan

Susan,
Lia Halstead called me to say Rafeal.pina@shell.com is looking for traders.
She didn't know his number and my contact at Coral didn't find him in their
database.
My contact said it might be Equiva even with a shell address.
Not much of a lead, but hope it can help.
Scott
