Wade called Eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then Wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts.  I was working on something else and I just asked Wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about.  Wade actually called Eric.

I've actually done a lot of things for him and Sherry concerning that very subject.  Why are you asking?  Did you get a call or something?

Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?  I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.  It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.  Just let me know.
