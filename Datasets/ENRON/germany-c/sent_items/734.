Robin is having back surgery next Thursday, Feb 28th.  She went to a neurosurgeon for a second opinion, Dr. Alfonso Aldama was her second opinion dude..  Dr. Esses, my second opinion dude, is an orthopedic surgeon.  And Dr.Alani, the guy I went to see first was an orthopedic surgeon.

Robin said I should go to a neurosurgeon.  What do you think?
