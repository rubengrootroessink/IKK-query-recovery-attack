they have an opening in the fall at bethany starting sep 3. they have a 4 to 1 ratio and are an accredited school.  the have 3 baby classes,  one for 2 to 4 month olds, one for 4 to 6 months old and a one for more active babies to toddlers.  they move babies based on development not necessarily age.   they require one month security deposit which gets applied to your last month as long as you give 30 days notice.  the fees are as follows:  $100 new family fee, $815/month, three "grounds and equipment fees"  one in the fall $155, one in the spring $155 and one in the summer $135.  

if you are interested in them you should go and tour the faciliity.  they officially give tours thurs mornings.  however, she said that i you call the day before or first thing in the morning they cover give an impromptu tour.

good luck
