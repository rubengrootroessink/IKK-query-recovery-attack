I've been waiting for an opportunity to speak with you but it appears that you have been very involved.

Daren Farmer works for Tom Martin on the Texas Desk upstairs.  Daren just accepted a position with AEP and Tom asked me if I would be interested in Daren's position.  I told him I would and I asked him to touch base with you.
