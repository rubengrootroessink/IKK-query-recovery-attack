Chris,

Be sure to call the electric co. to transfer your service.  It supposedly
takes them 3 business days to do a transfer, so I couldn't have mine
back-dated to when I moved.  I'm not sure how they'll work out the bills,
but I'm sure we'll get boo-foo'd somehow.

The number is (713) 207-7777.

I'm leaving soon to go to the Doc.
