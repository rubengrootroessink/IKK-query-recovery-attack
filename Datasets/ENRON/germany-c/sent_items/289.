you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on.  it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it.  i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building.

oh well,  YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
