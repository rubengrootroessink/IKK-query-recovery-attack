FYI, MCV swing activity on Trunkline, not ANR.  Monday, March 19th was the last conversation we had with MCV regarding this swing gas.

Chris,

      I spoke with Rochelle from MCV on Monday morning roughly 9:30am, and she went into her system and verified to me that we did not cut them, that they did receive the 8500mm's that they requested on Sunday March 18th. She assured me that they received all volumes they requested.
