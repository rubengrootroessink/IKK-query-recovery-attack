To my knowledge, we are not agent for these guys anymore.  I will double check with Germany, but I don't think we should roll into 2002.

Scott, 

In reconciling imbalances with Somerset Gas Transmission Company, LLC, Volume Management has discovered two contracts that were assigned from CES.  If these are valid, we need to load beginning balances as of 12/31/99.

The contracts are as follows: 

Contract 
Number          Agent for               Type of Service Class           Rate Schedule   Beginning Balance 

3005            Dannic Energy Corp      Gathering       Interruptible   I               5,425 mmbtu 

3028            Thomas Leeper           Gathering       Interruptible   I               500 mmbtu 

I will also need a transport capacity ticket set up.  Please let me know if we should set these contracts up of not. 

Thanks, 

Sherry Anastas
