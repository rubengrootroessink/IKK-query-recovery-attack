Subject:	Steve's Happy Hour

Since I got such an overwhelming response from everyone (Clarissa is the ONLY one that responded to my email...) about happy hour tonight and based on the rumors that I am hearing that a few people had WAY too much to drink last night, we are moving Steve's birthday happy hour to next week.  He says anyday is fine with him so if anyone has any preferences of where to go or when, please let me know.
see ya!
