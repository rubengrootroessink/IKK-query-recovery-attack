Max, I forgot all about you needing this.  I'm working on it now and I'll highlight the items as I do it in case it takes a couple of days.
This is what I have done so far.

Chris,
Just following up on this item as I have tried to process these adjustments and
they have not been zeroed in Sitara yet.  If I need to send these to someone
else, just let me know.

Thanks,
Max

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy.  These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida.  Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed.  If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,
Max

P.S.  I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.
