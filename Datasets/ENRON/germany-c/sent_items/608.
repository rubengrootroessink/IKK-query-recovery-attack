I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.

Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.
