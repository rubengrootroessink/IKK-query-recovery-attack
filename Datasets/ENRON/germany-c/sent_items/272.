this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday


I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant 

Tallahassee 	10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $1,106,700

MCV		6,800 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $752,556

I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.  I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit.
