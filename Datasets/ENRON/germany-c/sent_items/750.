Hey Guys!!

Joni is going to be in town this weekend and mentioned trying to get together with everyone on Saturday night.  Let me know if ya'll are going to be around or not.  Clarissa...I know you said you have a wedding this weekend,  but let me know if it's going to be an all night event. 

Thanks,
Meredith
