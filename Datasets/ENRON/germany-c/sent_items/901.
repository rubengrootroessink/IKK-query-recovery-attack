I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning.  GOOD NEWS.  I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous.

Enron is, in part, the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets. It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers.


I know what it means.  And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!!!
