Looky at what I just opened in my email.  I had some stuff tucked away in a different directory and I'm going thru it now.  Does this still need to be addressed?

Hey Chris,

Does this amount look correct to you??  Do we actually owe New Power $5MM ?  they haven't mentioned it to me, but it's showing up as a balance due to them.  could you please verify ASAP?


Thanks!
