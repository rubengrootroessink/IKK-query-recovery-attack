Would you see if we sent out an invoice for deal 384258 to Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. for December 2001 and January 2002?   And if we did, did they pay it?

Thanks

Has anybody found any transactions that might have been done in December '01 or January '02 for the Ponderosa Pine plant.

Specifically I'm looking for any Spot Gas Sales during this time???
