Interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to CES which was assigned (not via capacity release) to ENA.  

FYI, 

	demand charge =  $2.6614 per month    = $.0875 per dth 
	and the commodity is			$.0136
	Fuel =  2.902 % and at $2.10 = 		$.0628

	100% load factor cost = 			$.1639

As far as I know, ENA is not using any transport on Columbia Gas or Gulf.  If NiSource wants to recall, I do not believe it will create a problem.
Kim Olinger is coordinating all the Logistics activities for the wholesale desk.   (Kim...would you please confirm....).

It's important to note, that if ENA wants to keep this capacity, they must pay in full the outstanding indebtedness, together with accrued interest at the Commission approved interest rate, and furnish adequate assurance of payment to Releasor if required by the Releasor w/n 24 hours of being notified.
Since this message was not received from Nisource until 3:08 p.m. 1/31/02........ officially, Nisource can not recall the capacity until the evening cycle of 2/1/02.

I do want you to know that EES is actively nominating on Columbia Gas Transmission to the Columbia Gas of Ohio and PA markets.  If we receive any notice
of capacity recall on EES capacity, we will want to react and it will be critical to communicate this notification to me ASAP.

Thanks Rita!!

Donna,

I mentioned this to Bob on yesterday and he said to forward this to you.  We have not made any payments since we filed bankruptcy for pre or post petition activity at the direction of management.  When I spoke with the guy on yesterday, we agreed exactly on one of the invoices for around $80K, but he was supposed to get me the other contract number and amount since there are supposedly two outstanding invoices.  Please let me know how we need to handle this.

Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. has an existing capacity release to Enron North
America for 30,000 Dth per day. This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1
capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002.

It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November
2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its
post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible
for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff,
Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours
notice.

Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is
made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire
transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday,
February 5, 2002.

If you would like to discuss this matter, please give me a call at
telephone number 614-460-4996.
