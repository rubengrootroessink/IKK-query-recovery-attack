Drew,
We MAY need to make a payment for June gas of appx. $1.3MM for City of Tallahassee, which is on the gas cash forecast.  However, I am not certain that we will be buying the gas.  That decision will be made tomorrow, so please stay ready and we will inform you once we decide.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Ed,

Should I be expecting/receiving a request to prepay June gas?  My records show that our last prepay for gas occurred on April 29th.  Do you have any feel for how much/when we plan to pay?

Thanks,
