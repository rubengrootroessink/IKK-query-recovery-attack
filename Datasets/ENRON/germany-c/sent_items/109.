Here's what Beverly had to say.


Tell Chris hi for me too. And, congrats on the new baby!  This reorg is
going to be very interesting.  You are going to have scheduling people doing
contracts and accounting and vice versa.  They haven't announced who is
working for who yet, but we are getting the operations accounting people and
their manager.  Then, we are going from 4 teams to 3 big ones.  We'll see.
Supposedly, the managers are dividing up the customers first under the
managers, then putting us wherever they want, I guess.  It's kind of crazy
around here.  Let me put it this way - if the industry didn't suck right
now, I'd look for a new job.  This company is weird.  It takes them forever
to do anything, then they don't have the right people in the right places.
Plus, they are very, let's say conservative, instead of 'cheap'.  When you
are used to the best money can buy, like at Enron, then you go to a company
that complains if you throw away a paper clip, well, you get the picture?
No wonder it's taken them 5 years to get 1Line, which, by the way, still
doesn't work too well!!
