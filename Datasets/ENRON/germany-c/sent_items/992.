Hi Paul,

I just left you a voice mail.  I'm about to leave for the day but I wanted to let you know what I'm looking for.  I work on the East Desk at ENA and I'm trying to get copies of the following ENA and EES contracts.  These are the firm contracts listed on your ENA and EES notices dated November 29th and November 30th that I don't have.

ENA contracts
6020
5085
5072

EES contracts
6115
5916

I appreciate your help.  Please call me at 713-853-4743 of you have any comments or questions.

Chris L. Germany
