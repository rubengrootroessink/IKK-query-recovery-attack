Why don't you guys plan an evening in Houston and I'll show you the trade floor.  I really prefer to do it after 5:30 these days.  It doesn't have to be this week, I was just thinking about it.  Maybe I'll get a free meal off of both of ya!!!!!!!!!!

NO - we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at HALF NAKED BRAZILIAN WOMEN WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

You are both a bad influence on me already.
