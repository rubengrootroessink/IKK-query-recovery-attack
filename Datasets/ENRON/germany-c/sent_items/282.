Tenn Net 284 Contract

Commodity		$.0000
ACA			$.0021
GRI			$.0055

Total			$.0087

Fuel			1.31%


Iroq
Commodity		$.0036	  = .003 -.0001 + .0007  ( RTS Commodity - TCRA + Deferred Asset Surcharge)
ACA			$.0021
GRI			$.0000	Note: GRI does not apply on this path because Iroq delivers gas to Tenn at wright (non GRI point)

Total			$.0057

Fuel			.5%   Note:  The Iroq Tariff allows them to charge up to 1% fuel, but I believe the max is 1% for Zone 1 to Zone 2 and .5% for Zone 1 to Zone 1 but I didn't read that in the tariff.  I think Iroq might have told me that back in normal times.
