To my knowledge that capacity is still valid.  It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth.  

Ruth, I had asked George Linder? at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times.  He never did anything with it.

Chris,

there is also a demand fee of $714.14 that we pay on contract F01978 on National Fuel.  Is that still a valid charge.  The deal number is 1190921.  We are still accruing charges for 2002 on that deal.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Rita
