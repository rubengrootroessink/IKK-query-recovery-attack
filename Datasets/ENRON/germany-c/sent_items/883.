Chris,
I left a message with our Credit folks, but I'm not sure how long it will
take to get a response.  Both the manager and the main person we work with
in that group are out today.  The manager's voice message said he'd be in
the ofc tomorrow.

Hector,
Chris called today to ask what we would require from Enron so that they
could set up an IT contract on which they would do only pool-to-pool
transfers, with volumes up to 40,000 dt/day.  Since we can't stop shippers
from doing billable transactions on IT contracts, I assume credit will still
require some sort of financial backing, such as cash up front.  I left a
message for Ken Newberry, but it doesn't look like I'll hear back from him
before I leave today.  Please follow up with Ken this afternoon if you have
time or with Leldon tomorrow.

Chris' number is 713-853-4743

Hector's number is 713-215-4256.

Thank you.	ii
