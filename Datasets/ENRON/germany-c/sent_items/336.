The baby would be automatically covered for up to 30 days.  I would need to get a social security number and then file the paper work.

Call 1-800-332-7979 for more information.

Insurance and benefit questions

My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby and the due date is May 7th.  She
works for Williams and I work for Ed McMichael in the estate group.

We are currently living together but we have no immediate plans to get
married.  Also, she plans on taking off 6 months after the baby is born.
According to my girlfriends HR rep, her insurance will cover her for 12
weeks from the date the baby is born, after that she has to sign up for
COBRA.

These are my questions

When can I cover the baby under my insurance?

Will there be any problems moving the baby's coverage to her insurance
beginning 1/1/2003?

Can I cover my girlfriend under my insurance during her leave of absence
from Williams?
