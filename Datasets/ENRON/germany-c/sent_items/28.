Ilene Leahey is going to help print contracts from live-link.  She is from the local Andrews & Kurth office.  I have set her up at Julie Gomez's desk and she is using my id to print contracts.

She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her. 

Thanks.

She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

What specifically is she going to do?  Which contracts?

Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.

She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.

Let me know if you have any comments / concerns.

Thanks.
