So it was 10:00 AM and I'm about to leave, RIGHT?  My new boss says go sell that storage gas.  hmmm.  WHAT IF THE g.D. PIPELINE WON'T LET ME SHEDULE IT?  SHOULD I TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON A FRIDAY, THE FRIDAY BEFORE OUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY?  HOW ABOUT ALL THEM g.D. DAYS I WAS ASKING TO CALL THE PIPELINE TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD AND WOULD NOT LET US DO?  I now have work to do.


I'm not going shopping until this evening.

Have a nice day.
