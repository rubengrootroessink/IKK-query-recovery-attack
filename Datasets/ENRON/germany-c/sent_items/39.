fyi,

you guys can really help your child in the future by giving her lots of sensory input.  by sensory input i mean:  swaddling, stroking down her arms, legs and back  with different textures.  (diffferent types of fabric, ie, satin, terry cloth, knit etc....)  there is also a sensory brush but i don't know about it's use on babies.

the reason i say this is that my  children both have a sensory deficiency.  my little one, jerald, goes to occupational therapy once  a week for sensory input.  which is really nothing more than alot of fun play activities that incorporate the senses.  

in the information i was given to read for jerald,  they mentioned a link between c-section babies and sensory deficiits.  they claim that alot of sensory input occurs when the baby is pushed through and out of the birth canal which c-section babies obviously miss.  i don't know how true this is but the sensory input can't hurt her.
