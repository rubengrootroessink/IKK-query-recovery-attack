I have these 2 contracts highlighted in yellow and coded as Agency/Release.  They probably should just be release but I'll let you decide.

we bought PG&E, so those are actually our contracts.  In order for us to just use 1 logon, they had to make us agent

How does the agency with PG&E Energy Services work?

I show that EES is agent for two PG&E contracts.  Contract 67309 on CGAS and 67310 of Col Gulf.
