I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab.  
Now, I go to http://www.iroquois.com/igts/info/section-frame.html and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen.  
Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen.
And this is where I used to get an error message, now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded.

Good morning Chris:

Please tell me your exact problem in getting into the EBB or the error message
that you got or just a general description of what happened when you clicked on
Customer Activities on our website.

Yes, the capacity was awarded to Boston Gas.  I sent an email message to Jeff
LoConte and Liz Danehy about the release.  Haven't heard back from them.  I
told them they can nom on the released quantity.
