Probably not.  I'll introduce myself to Theresa later this week.

Theresa Vos tells me that she receives invoices directly from the suppliers and also receives an estimate of where the invoices should be from Justin Fernandez.  She says the two have reconciled closely since she's been responsible for payment (she picked this up in the Jan-Feb timeframe), with actuals usually coming in below Justin's estimates.  Accordingly, she has paid the invoiced amounts directly to the supplier without further reconcilliation.

Based on the above, should I be concerned with the "settlements" process?
