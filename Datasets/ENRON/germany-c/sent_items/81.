Subject: Pigging on PL-1 Re-Scheduled until Friday, June 11, 2002


Notice to all Dominion Transmission shippers:

In an effort to better accommodate the needs of our PL-1 customers we have
rescheduled the pigging work that was scheduled for Wednesday June 12,
2002, to Friday, June 14, 2002.  This notice replaces all other notices
that were posted on DTI's EBB with regard to this issue.  The
implementation of this restriction on Friday at 10:00 a.m. ECT (9:00 CCT),
means that there will be no interruptible transportation capacity or
non-PL1 transportation capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This
restriction will also require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1
system be made to their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and
secondary deliveries along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero
effective for the gas day of June 14, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).
Please give me a call if you have any questions.
