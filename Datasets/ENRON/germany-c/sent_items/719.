I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!  We spent our first night together Friday night.  Of course we both have colds / allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience.  It will take some getting used to thats for sure.  She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her pregnant heart.
