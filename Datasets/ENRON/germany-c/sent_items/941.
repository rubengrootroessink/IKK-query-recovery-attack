HEY GIRL.  It's so good to hear from you.  Let's see,

I'm still here.  I work on the estate team which means I work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave.  My buddy Goodell is will be working for NewCo (The New Company - is this original or what).  They should find out something in the next couple of days I think.  Other than that its just hand around and see what happens.

So did you make good grades?  What's that report card looking like.  How's the hubby?  You still in love or what?
