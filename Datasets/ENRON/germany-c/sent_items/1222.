My girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around January.  But not too many people know about that.  If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it.

Don't want no kitties.  I'm going home now because I've lost so much money today.  BYE

Chrisssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

I've been thinking about you. What's up with you. Mr. Singer said you were
looking at houses. I missed you at TCO meeting... you could have found
yourself another wife!!

I got two little kitties... so cute. Their names are cc and alex (sis and
brother). CC is for curious cat or crazy cat... she ran up the screen last
week, jumps on the kitchen counter and tore down some curtains.

I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore.  What are you doing?
