AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price		$5.4850
Transport to Stoi	$.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection		$.0249
Capacity Demand	$.0400

Total Price		$5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks
