Jackie, just wanted to let you know that there is some work on the pipeline in May.  I'm not sure of the impact just yet but either I or Kathy Kelly will keep you posted.

Thanks.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.
