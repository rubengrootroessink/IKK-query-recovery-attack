I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details;
Price:		$2.25
Volume:	1,121,702
Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1

Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC?

Doesn't look like tickets were ever entered in the system.  I've requested access to change the tickets.  I'll send a new email once I enter the deal.

Thanks

Let me know if you see any other missing items too.
