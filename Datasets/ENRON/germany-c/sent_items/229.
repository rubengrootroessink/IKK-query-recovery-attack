Chris,

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

Vince Hawkes is faxing Justin Fernandez a daily generation and gas plan sheet.  Kevin Brady is in the group that Justin was in before he left and Kevin is delivering this report to me everyday.  Is this something that we should continue to get?
