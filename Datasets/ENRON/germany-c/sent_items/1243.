I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June.  I can't remember.  I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year.  I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico.

Hey guys,

Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000  - Dec 2000? Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months?  Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month.  I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced.


Thanks
Darla
