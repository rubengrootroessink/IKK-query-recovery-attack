Hi Chris,

I have printed 96000326 and 96029358 (which is terminated)  and I can mail by interoffice mail if you would like. However, contract 96058895 is actually a GTC which was created because there is not a Master contract in place at this time.

Thanks,
Sharon

How would I get contract copies for the following deals?

Deal #

756186

I also believe deals 756168 and 756186 are the same.  I sent a message to Kimat to check this out.
