I've been talking to Scott Neal about the 35,000 day of Iroq/Tenn gas that we have.  Scott said you should be able to run a mini book on this deal against a different curve.  This deal is currently coming to the desk at M3.  I would like to value this deal at the CNG South Point curve.  I'm estimating a hit of $5,000,.000.

Please run a mini book on the following deals.

Deal		Comment
762435		Supply of 35,000 from Ontario
646813		Fuel of 465 from Ontario
624140		Long term sale to EES using Iroq/Tenn assets.


Please let me know if you have any questions.
thanks
