Scott,
	As we agreed, I'll book an annuity from Intra-Northeast to East-TP1 to reimburse TP1 for the August loss accumulated  since Scott Goodell stop trading TP1. The annuity amount is $76k which is arrived as follows:

	Monthly loss as of August 30th P&L               $ (266,655)
	Less Prompt Month Loss(Chris responsible)    $ 170,657
	Less Deal VY9032 Impact(Chris responsible)   $   20,000

	Net amount                                                   $ 75,998

This will be reflectedin tonight's P&L. Thanks.


Kimat
