Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.  

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.


Kimat

I think you have my NYMX value in backwards.

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This 
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.
