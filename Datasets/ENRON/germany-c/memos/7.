Effective end of business day on Thursday, May 30, 2002, UBSW Energy contacts will no longer be available in the Enron Global Address List when using Outlook.  After Thursday, UBSW Energy employees may be addressed using the following format:  firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com>.

Also, please be aware of distribution list changes below:
q	Personal Distribution Lists in Outlook Contacts folder:  any local distribution lists previously containing these addresses for UBSW Energy employees will need to be updated reflecting the new address format.  Please make the necessary modifications to your distributions lists to avoid message delivery failures.
q	Enron Global Address Book Distribution Lists:  UBSW Energy employee addresses will be deleted from all distribution lists in the Enron Global Address Book.  Messages intended for distribution lists previously containing UBSW Energy employees will only be delivered to internal Enron addresses - to include UBSW Energy employees, their new firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com> email addresses must be manually included.

Thank you for your cooperation.
