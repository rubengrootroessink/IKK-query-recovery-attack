Ruth, Chris, & Fitz,

Frank Vickers has asked me to set up a meeting for us to discuss the Boston Gas situation - how we can restructure (upstream and/or downstream) the deal, what positions are struggling on the North American side, what is our current position, etc.   Ruth and Chris, the above-mentioned time is just a suggestion - Loftus and I are fairly flexible for the remainder of today and/or tomorrow - except 10:00 am and 2:00 pm tomorrow).  Please let me know if another time will work better for either of you.  Basically, we need you to please lay out for us some of the history behind the deal, address some of the issues mentioned previously, and help brainstorm how Loftus and I can go forward from this point.

Thanks very much for your help,

Jim Willis
