Frequently Asked Questions

1. HOW DO I SIGN UP? Fill out registration form below.

2. Can I bring my child with me during my volunteer time?
Unfortunately we do not have daycare. So we ask that you do not bring your
children with you. If you have a teenager that is 16 years old or older,
they will be able to work in the mail room but they must sign up.

Yes, as long as space is provided. So sign-up asap.

4. Do I have to sign-up before Sharathon or can I just show up?
You must sign-up ahead of time.

5. How long are the shifts?
 Most shifts are 4 hours long with the exception of the last shift on
Saturday which is 6 hours long. We ask that you arrive 30 minutes before you
shift starts so you can be trained.

6. Can I volunteer in more than one area?
Yes, as long as you sign-up for them before Sharathon.

7. When my volunteer time is over, can I volunteer for another shift? No due
to limited space in our building. However, if you want to sign-up ahead of
time for more than one shift, you may.

8. Do I have to stay for the complete 4 hours shift?
Yes, we expect you to stay for the complete shift. However, we do want you
to have an enjoyable experience. So you will get refreshments and breaks
when you need them.

Yes as long as both of you sign up.

10. I have never volunteered before will there be training?
Yes. We ask that you arrive 30 minutes before your shift begins so that you
may be trained.

11. Can I bring my spouse, a family member or friend with me when I
volunteer?
If they have not signed-up to volunteer or if they are not going to
volunteer during your shift, we ask that you do not come with you due to
limited space in our building.

12. I have volunteered for several Sharathons, do I have to arrive early for
training also?
Yes, because there have been a few changes this year due to EFT(Electronic
Funds Transfer).  However, if you would like to train others, please let us
know when you sign-up and we will have a special training session for you.

13. I am unable to make it to KSBJ, can I volunteer from my home, church, or
a different location?

pray wherever you are at for the KSBJ staff, volunteers, and listeners.
