Was any capacity released under this contract in November?

There is no deal number in Sitara with a demand fee for this contract for November forward.  Deal # 429424 has IM - Market East as the Agent.
If we need to pay a transport fee for this contract, then a new deal needs to be set up.

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Brenda
