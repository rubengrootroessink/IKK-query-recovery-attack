Just wanted to see how things were going.  I heard that Vicki had her baby recently!  Is there a way I can contact her while she's on maternity leave? (or is she checking her work email at home?)  

When I talked to you (long time ago) you said you were going to be writing me a novel email.  What happened?  Probably go lost in the mail, huh?  Someone said that Dick Jenkins had moved to another group, is that true?  I guess there have been a lot of changes since I left.  

Anyways- I hope all is well and I hope to hear from you soon! -Angie

PS-  I saw Sean Connery this morning on the way to work.  He lives in a flat that's just down the street from Enron House.  Brent told me that his co-worker lives next door to him.  Pretty cool, huh?!
