Attached are copies of the letters sent to Enron by The Central Pacific Group.  This is one of the small Appalachian producers supplying Enron on Dominion and other pipes.

I'm wondering if we can use one of these letters as a valid termination of the gas purchase contract and what would the effective date of that termination be?

Let me know or just give me a call.

Also, I'm trying to estimate the number of hours required to work on the Dominion producers.  I'll like to chat with you about that as well.

Thanks.
