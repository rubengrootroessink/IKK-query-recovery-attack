Scott and Chris--

I show you still have the following imbalances on some of your PALs.

K#36621 Enron Park		Balance: 1,783 Dth long (Activity on 10/17
put long).
K#37001 Enron Loan		Balance: 2 Dth Long (No Activity)
K#37875 Enron Park		Balance:1 Dth Long (No Activity)
K#37876 Enron Loan		Balance: -1780 Short (No Activity)

The numbers should equal out, except that you will be 4 long on one contract
and 4 short on another when added up.

Let me know how you want to resolve.

Corey
