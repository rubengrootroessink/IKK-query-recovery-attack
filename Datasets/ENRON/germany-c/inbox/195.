No on-system capacity available, that includes excess injections or deliveries to Distribution City Gate.

IT through Concord is available for tomorrow's gas day for up to 100,000 dth.
 Have any of you gotten a better handle on the pricing we saw late yesterday?  Gas Daily quoted trader's who thought there was some unexplained buying go on.
