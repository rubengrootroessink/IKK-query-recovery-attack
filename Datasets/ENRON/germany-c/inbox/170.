I guess we all do care about the AGA number.  If the number is low due to the increasing difficulty companies are having injecting gas, I believe it.  Our system is very full right now.

Therefore, no excess injections for tomorrow.

IT through Concord for 100,000 dth.

Excess withdrawal's and IAS gas is available for 100,000 dth.
