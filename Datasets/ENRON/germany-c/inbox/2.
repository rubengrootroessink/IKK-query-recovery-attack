fyi,

i added the producer selected reallocation date to the spreadsheet you provided and renamed it dtidec01split1.   As we discussed there were a number of meters that were not listed in your spreadsheet.  I also found one counterparty that had a different producer date than pipeline date.   That counterparty was Elvis Energy.   The list of meters not in your file are listed below.

Commonwealth 				4078701
Creston Well Service			3329701
