Kam,

Do I need to involve Settlements on this item.  Appears that we are expecting some money back to the book.  Let me know and we will take the lead on this.  Thanks.

John

Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me 

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,
Linda S. Bryan

Brenda, I am going to put the National Fuel demand charge on deal 241639.  I will enter it as a negative demand charge.


Elizabeth, would you get me a copy of the contract or confirm for deal 241639 please?



Thanks
