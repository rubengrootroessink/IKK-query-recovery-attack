Kim,

Please order Chris a power strip. I was not able to power on his PC because he did not have a free outlet.

Please call the Resolution Center (3-1411) to request IDF 6F4A-B be activated. I would have done this myself, but the Network Team is now requiring a Co. and RC #.

One more thing, Chris is requesting Monitor Arms. If you do order them for him, he will need two sets of Vertical Arms. These Arms can be ordered via e-mail from Reggie Wilson.

Chris,

As soon as the power strip comes in and the port is activated I can come by and complete the install.


If you have any questions please call me. 

thanks,

Dalton Hogan
