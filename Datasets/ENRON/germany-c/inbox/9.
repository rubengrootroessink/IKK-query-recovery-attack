EVER WONDER

In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through  
stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.  
  
On a Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping. (and that's the only time  I have to work on my hair).  
  
On a bag of Fritos: ..You could be a winner! No purchase necessary.Details  inside. (the shoplifter special)?  
  
On a bar of Dial soap: "Directions: Use like regular soap." (and that would  be how???....)  
  
On some Swanson frozen dinners: "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's  "just" a suggestion).  
  
On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): "Do not turn upside down."  (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!  
  
On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:"Product will be hot after heating."  (...and you thought????...)  
  
On packaging for a Rowenta iron: "Do not iron clothes on body." (but  wouldn't  this save me more time)?  
  
On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:"Do not drive a car or operate machinery  after taking this medication." (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of  
construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with  head-colds off those forklifts.)  
  
On Nytol Sleep Aid: "Warning: May cause drowsiness." (and...I'm taking  this because???....)  
  
On most brands of Christmas lights: "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as  opposed to...what)?  
  
On a Japanese food processor: "Not to be used for the other use." (now,  somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)  
  
On Sunsbury's peanuts: "Warning: contains nuts." (talk about a news flash)  
  
On an American Airlines packet of nuts: "Instructions: Open packet, eat  nuts." (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)  
  
On a child's superman costume: "Wearing of this garment does not enable you  to fly." (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)  
  
On a Swedish chainsaw:"Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or  genitals." (..was there a lot of this happening somewhere?)
