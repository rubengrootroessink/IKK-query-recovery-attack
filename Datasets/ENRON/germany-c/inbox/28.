Want to do something to support America in its war on terror. "Thank" a servicemember, our main customer, for the work they are doing. Go to the site below and add your name.
 
 
  
  Subject:	Thanks to our Soldiers
  
For our friends, family, and fellow Americans we don't even know who are in uniform.......
If you are so inclined, visit the Department of Defense web page below and sign a brief message thanking the men and women of the U.S. military services for defending our freedom.
The compiled list of names will be sent out to our soldiers at the end
of the month.
 
So far, there are only about 52,000 names. A shame.
