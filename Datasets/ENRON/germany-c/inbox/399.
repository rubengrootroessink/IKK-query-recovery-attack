Hey Bud,

Just checking on you.  Hope your weekend was nice.  Thanks for coming down
Thanksgiving.  Mr. and Mrs Boeker got a kick out of you.  Hey, that is great
in cowboy jargon.  Take care and holler back!

I was going to tell you an Abi Dabi Thanksgiving Joke, but I had better be
politically correct.  Something about DUCK being served as the bird of
choice or something of that nature!

Keep your powder dry!

Yo Bro
