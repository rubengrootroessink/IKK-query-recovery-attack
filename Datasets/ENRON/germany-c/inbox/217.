                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                              NOTICE OF OPEN SEASON
                                 Midwest Project

                                October 16, 2001



OVERVIEW

Columbia is conducting an open season in conjunction with CMS Panhandle
Companies ("CMS Panhandle") that would path natural gas supplies from the
MidContinent production and Chicago Hub areas into Ohio.  Columbia's system is
connected to CMS Panhandle via multiple points in western Ohio.  Columbia
intends to offer this as a "seamless" service, whereby Columbia would manage
the nomination and billing service for this linked path between CMS Panhandle
and Columbia.  Due to the multiple transportation paths available into
Columbia's system via the CMS Panhandle system, Columbia is requesting that
interested parties submit their requests for capacity and service in accordance
with the terms set forth below.  In the event the preferred receipt path is
beyond the service that can be provided by either CMS Panhandle or Columbia,
Columbia may look to extend the supply path, as necessary, by including other
transportation providers.


LENGTH OF OPEN SEASON

The open season period will commence on Friday, October 12, 2001, and close at
4:30 p.m. E.T. on Friday, December 14, 2001. During the open season, interested
parties desiring service should submit a request form in accordance with the
minimum requirements set forth in this notice.


SERVICE DESCRIPTION

Subject to the terms of this open season and depending on the interest
expressed through completed request forms, Columbia will evaluate the
possibility of using either existing or new capacity for service under its Firm
Transportation Service ("FTS") Rate Schedule from its west receipt points into
Ohio, located at Crossroads, Cecil, Maumee, and Lebanon. The open season
targets Market Areas 1 through 9 and 15 in Ohio and Northern Kentucky,
respectively. Columbia would also consider requests for summer service
(April-October), where practical.

Columbia also will evaluate non-binding proposals from existing customers to
turn back firm capacity under existing service agreements that may reduce the
amount of capacity for which facilities would need to be constructed. However,
any such proposal(s) would have to be compatible with the specific terms of any
project that Columbia may ultimately propose.


CONTRACT TERM/SERVICE COMMENCEMENT

The suggested minimum contract term that Columbia will consider is ten (10)
years. The minimum term will depend on the need, or not, for new facilities to
be constructed. Parties submitting a request form should indicate a preferred
service commencement date, with the earliest commencement date being December
31, 2001 (if existing capacity on the Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers, can be used to accommodate the
requested service).


RATES

Rates will be derived in accordance with Columbia's and CMS Panhandle's FERC
Gas Tariff, based upon an evaluation of requests for service and capital
expenditures necessary to meet such requests.


PARTICIPATION IN THE OPEN SEASON

To participate in Columbia's open season, interested parties desiring service
should submit a request, which includes the following items, by 4:30 p.m. E.T.
on Friday, December 14, 2001:

1. One completed request form (attached), with specific attention to the
   primary term of service, service commencement date, total capacity
  requested, and the desired receipt and delivery point(s);

2. One completed Credit Application Form (attached), to be submitted only by
   interested parties that do not currently receive service from Columbia.



REQUEST FORM ASSESSMENT/FINALIZING SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS

Upon the close of the open season, Columbia will assess the requests for
service. Columbia will evaluate the system and capital requirements necessary
to provide requested service and develop rates and terms and conditions of
service based on the required system enhancements. If, in Columbia's sole
discretion, there is enough interest to justify going forward, Columbia will
notify parties that submitted request forms as to their award of any existing
or expansion capacity. In the event requests for capacity exceed the amount of
expansion capacity that Columbia can economically construct and make available,
available expansion capacity will be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis.

All parties awarded capacity will be required to enter into binding precedent
agreements and service agreements with Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers to complete the path. Such agreements
must be executed and returned to Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other
transportation service providers, as deemed necessary, within a designated
period of time; otherwise, an award of capacity will be subject to rejection.
All binding precedent agreements and service agreements entered into as a
result of the open season must reflect an arm's-length transaction between the
requesting party and Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other transportation service
providers, as deemed necessary. Following the return of executed agreements,
Columbia may reallocate any remaining available capacity (if any), but will not
be obligated to do so. During the open season, affiliates of Columbia shall be
required to request capacity on the same basis as non-affiliates; that is, an
affiliate's request shall be evaluated using the same criteria used to evaluate
non-affiliates' requests. To effectuate a seamless service for nomination and
billing purposes, Shippers will name Columbia as agent for Shipper under any
necessary upstream transportation agreements on CMS Panhandle.




RESERVATIONS

These procedures and the attached forms are provided solely to enable
interested parties to submit a request for an award of capacity. Neither this
open season notice, the attachments herein, nor information provided in
response to questions or requests about these procedures shall constitute an
enforceable agreement. Columbia reserves the right to not make any capacity
available, to conduct additional open seasons, to determine the size, scope,
and cost of the project, to not consider requests that do not provide a
sufficient level of detail to aid in the development of a proposed project, and
to reject or accept materials it receives after the close of the open season.
