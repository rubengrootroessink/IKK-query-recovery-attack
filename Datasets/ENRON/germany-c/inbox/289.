Hello Everyone,
I hope you are all doing well. We will begin Giving Tree 2001 later this
month. Giving Tree is when we allow listeners to submit names of people who
are in need. Then we announce those needs on the air. Listeners that can
meet those needs call in and we match them up together. Last year over 300
families were helped. We are in need of volunteers to help us with this
project. We need data entry volunteers and phone volunteers. Volunteers are
needed to volunteer 3 hours a week for the duration of Giving Tree. You can
volunteer more than once a week if you would like to. Please email or call
me if you are able to be a Giving Tree Volunteer, or if you have any
questions about being a Giving Tree Volunteer.
Thanks,
Charlotte Estrada
Community Relations Assistant

Here is the Giving Tree Volunteer schedule.

Monday, November 26 - data entry; 2 - 3 hours

Wednesday, November 28 - data entry; 2 - 3 hours

Friday, November 30 - data entry; 2 - 3 hours
(We would prefer to have the Monday or Wednesday volunteer come back on
Friday, instead of a new volunteer)

Monday, 12/3 - Friday, 12/21 (No volunteers on Sundays); shifts are 7 -
10am, 10am - 1pm, 1 - 4pm, 4 - 7pm, 7 - 9pm.  We need one volunteer to work
during each time slot answering phones and light data entry work.

We need a second volunteer to work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays doing
data entry work only.  This person will need to work 3 hours anytime during
these days.
