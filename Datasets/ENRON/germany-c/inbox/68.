Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron.  Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.  In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution.  Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution?  Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching.  Thanks again!
