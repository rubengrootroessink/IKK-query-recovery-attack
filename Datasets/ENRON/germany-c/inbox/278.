What leg do you show we are out of balance on?

   Scott and Chris--

   I show you still have the following imbalances on some of your PALs.

   K#36621 Enron Park          Balance: 1,783 Dth long (Activity on 10/17
   put long).
   K#37001 Enron Loan          Balance: 2 Dth Long (No Activity)
   K#37875 Enron Park          Balance:1 Dth Long (No Activity)
   K#37876 Enron Loan          Balance: -1780 Short (No Activity)

   The numbers should equal out, except that you will be 4 long on one
   contract
   and 4 short on another when added up.

   Let me know how you want to resolve.

   Corey
