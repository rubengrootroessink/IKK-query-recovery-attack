You do have some valid points. However, Location, location location! Would
you like for me to run the price up to $190K?
There is a new gated community going in off of T.C. Jester, north of 11th.
Would you like some prices?
I'll forward any new listings I come across.

PS,Tell Berry to give me a call if he wants to look at apartment prices and
purchase items. I did not get his e-mail. Thanks
Have a great weekend!
