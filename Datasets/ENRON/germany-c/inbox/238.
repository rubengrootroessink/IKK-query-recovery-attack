SUBJECT:   2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE

In February 2002, Columbia's Line BM-22 in Martin Co., KY will be out of

of approximately 23,000 Dth/d of production flowing through Kermit Compressor.
This includes the following lines: P-94, V-55 and BM-18.

In the spring of 2002, contingent upon the mining activity, Columbia's Line KA
will be out of service for three (3) days due to a coal mining relocation tie
in.  Approximately 100,000 Dth/d of Appalachian production west of the May Fork
valve on Line KA will be shut in.

In the spring of 2002, Columbia's Boldman Compressor located in Pike Co., KY,
will have one unit down for approximately two (2) months for annual maintenance
which results in a 15,000 Dth/d flow reduction.  Affected is Equitable's Hi-Hat
(F3) pipeline, CNR's Boldman (CNR02) pipeline, and Appalachian production
located on Columbia's Lines PM-3 and PM-17.

In May-June 2002, Columbia's Line's BM-18, Line VM-141 and Line V-55 will be
out of service for five (5) days due to a relocation for WV Rt. 52 in Mingo

In March 2002, Columbia anticipates an outage of three (3) days on Columbia's

will be out of service for one (1) week due to annual maintenance.

In the fall of 2002, Columbia's Line KA will be out of service for three (3)
