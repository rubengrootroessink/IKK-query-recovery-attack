Deal # 271273 (ENA - IM ME New England) had been flagged as the primary desk but has a stop date of 9/30/01. 

Does this deal number need to be extended or has the primary desk changed for the PALs contract on IROQ starting with October?
Deal # 835134 is the TP1 deal # for this contract.

Thanks,
Brenda
