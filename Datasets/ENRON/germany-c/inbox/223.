Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,
Linda S. Bryan

Brenda, I am going to put the National Fuel demand charge on deal 241639.  I will enter it as a negative demand charge.


Elizabeth, would you get me a copy of the contract or confirm for deal 241639 please?



Thanks
