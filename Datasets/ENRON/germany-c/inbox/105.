May 23, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) is expecting mild temperatures this
weekend, along with decreases in demand that is inherent in a long
holiday weekend. As such, TE will have limited ability to absorb due-
shipper gas into the system.  Effective gas day Saturday, May 26, 2001,
TE is requesting that all shippers ensure that physical receipts do not
exceed physical deliveries. No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled,
and OBA parties should ensure that physical takes match scheduled
nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas may be scheduled through your
Operations Account Manager.  These restrictions are expected to be in
effect through the holiday weekend.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
