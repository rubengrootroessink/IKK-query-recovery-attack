That sounds very nice, especially the part about everyone loving me.  There's only one problem, I don't like work any more than you do, probably less.

Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.  So I 
have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.  I propose 
that I stay home and be a house husband.  You would have a hot (oatmeal) 
meal waiting for you when you get home.  The dog would love you, the cat 
would love you, I would love you....... 

What do you think?
