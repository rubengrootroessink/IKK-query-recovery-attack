NEW FROM VINDIGO--RESTAURANT REVIEWS FROM GAYOT

We're delighted to announce the addition of a
great new source of restaurant reviews now
available to Vindigo users. Gayot Publications
provides witty and professional reviews for
all Vindigo cities in the U.S.

Since the early '70s, Andre Gayot has been
directing sophisticated travelers to the best
restaurants, hotels, shops, sightseeing, and
cultural attractions throughout the world. He
now leads a team of savvy food critics and
travel experts, and publishes Gayot guidebooks,
which are informative, honest and detailed.
Above all, they tell it like it is.

Esquire magazine describes Gayot as "the best
[guides] out there".

As of November 21, reviews from the Zagat Survey
will no longer be available on Vindigo. If you
currently use Zagat reviews in your version of
Vindigo, at some time in November when you
sync that content will be replaced with
content from Gayot.

content, visit www.zagat.com.
