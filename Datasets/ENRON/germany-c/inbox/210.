Dear cgerman,

Welcome to Vindigo. Now you can hold the city in your hand!

Simply tell Vindigo where you are and it will tell you where to find the best of everything. Vindigo will even give you directions to help get you there. And if you're feeling generous, you can beam a copy of Vindigo to a friend. Just tap Give on Vindigo's home screen.
