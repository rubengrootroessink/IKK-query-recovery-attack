                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                                 
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 01, 2001

Notice ID: 3144
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          


SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in 
Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.  Columbia anticipates 
this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately 
mid-November 2001.  However, the start date and duration of the outage is 
contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining 
activity.  Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes 
that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.  The 
following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.
