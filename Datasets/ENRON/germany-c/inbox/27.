Robin-

Yes, I did see an extensive resume.  We have forwarded it to the hiring manager.  

We do respond to every internal candidate one way or the other.

Thanks,

Fran

Were you able to print out my resume?  What is the procedure for jobs online?  Do you respond to everyone who submits a resume?  If so, what is the response timeline? 

Thanks,

Robin

I am interested in applying for the above referenced position.  I have worked in orgination and trading postions for nine years and have a B.S. in Civil Engineering.
After reading the job description it sounds like I am qualified for the position.  Can I send you my resume or do I need to apply online?
