Bankrupt Utility Executives Likely to Get Another Bonus

    In a move that may become a public relations nightmare, the executives who steered Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy are expected to be granted huge bonuses under a plan to pay them $17.5 million, doubling some of their salaries. The bonus plan has been fiercely criticized by consumer groups, but has been provisionally approved by creditors. Some of the payments outlined in the bonus plan are linked to PG&E filing a Chapter 11 reorganization plan no later than January, a move the utility was already prepared to do. The willingness on the part of the creditors to pay the ransom is presumably tied to their belief that bankruptcy proceedings will be much quicker and smoother if they are not delayed by threatened departures and replacements. It's not a question of whether they are bad managers, but simply one of expediency.  The bonus plan follows a much bigger $50 million round of bonuses handed out to employees just days before the utility sought bankruptcy protection!

Natural Gas Futures Dip Back Down

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX ended the session closed sharply lower in moderate trading yesterday after failing to break resistance at $4.20 amid bearish speculation on todays AGA storage report. The July contract dropped $0.177 to $3.892, and August lost $0.176 to $3.975 per MMBtu. A tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico failed to develop into a stronger system, which also pressured prices lower. And, most traders are expecting a return to a triple digit increase in the latest storage inventory data, and a return of recent lows. The Northeast is expecting a large injection because of the past holiday weekend and little demand. The market extended the slide after breaking through psychological support at $4.00 and then 3.96, the low from Monday's session. After several days of unusually cool weather, much of the eastern half of the nation will have warmer temperatures late this week and early next week. The most intense heat will continue in the southwestern sta!
te!
s, but the hot weather will move into Texas and portions of the central Plains by early next week, further boosting demand. Also, a tropical disturbance located off the Texas coast was going to be investigated by an Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance Aircraft. The disturbance is expected to move north into the upper Texas and Louisiana coastal areas producing torrential rain. But, the failure of the disturbance to intensify to a tropical depression put downward pressure on the futures. Look for fairly quiet trading ahead of the storage report with a bias toward the downside. Look for the market to rally if the storage injection is less than 90 Bcf, and drop if it is greater than 100 Bcf. The next level of support is pegged at $3.82 and then $3.67. Resistance is seen at $4.20 and then $4.25. Natural gas for next day delivery across most of the US was mixed to somewhat higher yesterday, except out west where spot prices continued to rise sharply. Canadian spot prices were genera!
ll!
y lower. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04 to $3.99 per MMBtu.

BP Plans $600 Million Trinidad Natural Gas Project

     BP Trinidad and Tobago is preparing to launch a $600 million offshore natural gas project next month to supply its giant Atlantic LNG plant. The Kapok project will comprise a state-of-the-art, unmanned gas production platform linked to a new central processing unit in an offshore natural gas field. The central processing unit is capable of processing 1.6 Bcf per day in addition to considerable quantities of crude and condensate. The Kapok field has an estimated 3 Tcf which will be brought on stream for trains two and three at Atlantic LNG.

California PUC to Miss Edison Rescue Deadline

   The California PUC is expected to miss Fridays deadline to implement parts of a state-sponsored rescue plan for Southern California Edison. Though the regulators are expected to take up parts of the plan at a June 14th meeting, the delay will allow either the state or SCE if they choose, pushing it closer to bankruptcy. The MOU called for the state to buy Edison's share of California's power grid for $2.76 billion, and for SoCal Edison to issue bonds to pay off old power debt.

BPA to Outline Northwest Power Situation

    The BPA plans to announce today its progress in efforts to reduce demand for its electricity, and will outline possible power rate scenarios that will take effect in October. The rates discussed at the 12:30 EDT announcement will be at 250% - 300% premiums. On October 1st, new contracts begin for BPA's fixed rate customers, although rate and load terms have yet to be set. On April 9th, BPA announced that the region's electricity system was headed for wholesale rate increases of 250% or more starting October 1st unless BPA's regional retail utilities and large industrial customers, including aluminum smelters, reduce their energy use. June 22nd is the last day fixed-rate customers have to negotiate a new agreement with BPA for the next 5 years. On June 29th, BPA will submit its final power rates to the FERC that will be in effect for the 6 months beginning in October.

AES and Williams Subjects of Antitrust Investigation

    The Justice Department is investigating whether AES and Williams violated antitrust laws by agreeing to limit expansion of some AES plants. The DOJ launched an investigation last month focusing on a deal between AES Southland and Williams Energy Services. It alleges that the agreement limits the expansion of electric generating capacity at or near certain plants owned by AES Southland. AES has been ordered to answer questions and turn over documents related to the case. Williams markets power produced by two AES Southland generation plants under a 20-year agreement. Williams supplies natural gas and receives the electric output in return for fixed fees from AES. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle accusations that it withheld electricity produced at two AES generating plants in southern California from the ISO.

Northeast Power Operators Plan Trading System

     The New York ISO says it plans to develop a system that will allow energy companies to buy and sell wholesale energy inter-regionally on a single website tied to each company's market scheduling systems. The effort is primarily aimed at enhancing services for energy traders. Over the past few months, the NY ISO, PJM, ISO New England and the IMO have agreed to share energy reserves and have proposed a plan to standardize their power markets. The technology, called a Collaborative Scheduling System, will permit a buyer or seller of wholesale electricity to go to any one market's website and schedule all of their wholesale energy transactions throughout the entire Northeast.

TRENTON/BLACKRIVER "BOOM" IN WEST VIRGINIA

Land and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acres of mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia. The first Trenton/Blackriver production found in the state, was in a well drilled in 1962 by Tidewater Oil Company adjoining our property. We need an industry
partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000 acres would also make a great gas storage field.

We also have another small storage field for sale near the new Trenton Wells.

PG&E Not Responsible for Power Bills

    Pacific Gas & Electric has reached an agreement with the California ISO that will ensure it will not be left responsible for billions of dollars of state emergency electricity purchases the current energy crisis. The terms were agreed to in a bankruptcy court hearing that allow the judge to draft an order to settle the issue. Both sides would be satisfied with a ruling that runs similar to a federal order already requiring the ISO to only facilitate power sales to credit-worthy buyers. With Pacific Gas & Electric seeking bankruptcy protection, the California Department of Water Resources has emerged as one of the only credit-worthy buyers now purchasing power for the state. The ISO has continued to send Pacific Gas & Electric invoices for power purchases made on its behalf by the DWR, even though the state plans to issue up to $13.4 billion in bonds to recoup the costs of the power.
