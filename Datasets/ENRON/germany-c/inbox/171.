Subject:	Happy Hour

OK, we are going to have a happy hour Thursday October 25th at Little Woodrow's downtown 5pm.  Since Mr. Barker has decided to leave the nest we need to go drink a few (or in Bob's case, several) in his honor.  I don't want this to turn into a sad scene, with everybody crying and begging Jim not to go............  let's just enjoy the nice weather on the deck and nobody should feel bad letting Jim pick up the tab  (he is going to be making Dynegy money now).



On a side note, I talked with the manager of Little Woodrow's and he mentioned something about noise ordinance and not being allowed to play accordians anymore????



Please pass this on to anybody else that I left off the distribution.
