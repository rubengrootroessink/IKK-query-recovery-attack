Re:  East Lateral Line 300 - Line Lowering Project
Notice ID: 3839
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          

Columbia Gulf Transmission (CGT) will be performing a line lowering project on 
a portion of its East Lateral Line 300 beginning on June 24, 2002.  This 
project is expected to take seven days to complete.

The only location to be impacted by this project is 4119 - AEP/Equitable 
Storage.  This location is impacted because it is solely connected to Line 300. 
 While this work is being performed, CGT will be unable to accept nominations 
for delivery to or receipt from this location.

A revised notice will be posted once the work has been completed and CGT is 
able to resume accepting nominations for this location.
