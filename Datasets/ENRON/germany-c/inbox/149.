Chris,

If you're in a position to send Tim Riordan a resume and mention my name, Tim will hand walk it to Maria Hooper, the person who will be hiring the position.  Tim is expecting your inquiry.

Tim's e-mail address is:		tim.f.riordan@usa.conoco.com

Let me know if I can get you any specific information and I'll do my best!

sg
