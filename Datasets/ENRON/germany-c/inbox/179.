Yes we do have the capacity for both time frames, and yes, it is Max rate.

For deals less than a year, we have to post for 3 business days, for deals a
year or greater we must post for 5 business days....

Here's another one, 500 dth from Z0/ZL to Dungannon for Nov-Mar and / or
Apr 02 - Oct 02.  I'm guessing max rate.  Let me know.  I just want to make
sure you have it to sell.

Also, how does the open season work?

   I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to
   sell.

   Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and
   Nov-1year.

   Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a
   demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.

   Thanks
