Hey Squat Low,

Debbie and I went for a Booze Cruise last Saturday Night up the Bernard.  My
Buddy has a 95 Mastercraft which is immaculate.  Man, that is a nice boat.
His son does the bare foot thing and ski boarding.  Man, I told Jerry there
are a million more homes on the river than I remember.  I don't remember the
banks being that high either.  Hey, Debbie's parents are selling their home
on the Bernard.  It is down close to the mouth.  The are approximately two
hundred yards up and across the river from Perry's windmills.  The house is
about 1400 square feet upstairs, two be, open living, dining, kitchen, one
bath.  Garage and small efficiency apartment downstairs with bath room.
There is river frontage with canal frontage down the south side of lot.  I
think it is listed for $140/152 k.  Hopefully it will sell pronto.  How much
is the insurance and taxes all together, please itemize!  Time to head out
to God's Country.  My second light bill was $58.  I have not moved the
washer and dryer into the house as of yet.  I still have to buy a gas dryer.
We keep the thermostat on 76 until bedtime.  I turn it down to 75 so it will
be sort of snuggly!   Hmmmhuuu!  See you in the funnies.

Keep your powder dry!!!

Be Safe!

Yo'

Bro'

Subject: House Papers


Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something
like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.
Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I
don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm
going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and
dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I
come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a
new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a
70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.
