Subject: PSNC PROBLEM ON MARCH 1ST

Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC 
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth 
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled?  Thank you.
