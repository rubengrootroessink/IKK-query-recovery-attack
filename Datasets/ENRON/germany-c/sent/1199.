I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?
