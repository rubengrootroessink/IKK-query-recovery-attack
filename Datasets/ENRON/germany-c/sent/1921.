This is what's in Unify.  The only odd item is how I entered the cashout, as 
a negative demand charge.  I used 1618 dts x $7.611 (It buy in Zone 6).

Let me know what you think.  Maybe we should add the IT transport to the 
cashout from Z6 to Z4.  I would certainly want to do that if they were short.
