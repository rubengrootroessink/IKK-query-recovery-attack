Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets 
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.
