Yo buddy!!  I do have a worksheet but I still need to go through CES 
officially.  Let me chat with Doug Kinney.  I think it will be ok.  I also 
told Doug that my worksheet was probably easier to use when looking at total 
by Pipeline.  Get back with you soon.

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike
