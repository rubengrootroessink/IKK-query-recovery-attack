With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
