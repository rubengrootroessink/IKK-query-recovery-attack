Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and 
I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone 
number?

I received faxes (Enfolio Spot Confirmations) on the above agreements with 
Enron
that show as follows:

East Tennessee Rate:  $2.6264 per MMBtu

Cook School Road Rec. Sta:  CNG Index minus $0.125

Are these the rates I should use to invoice Enron for these agreements?

I need to get the invoices to Sandra at Enron today, if you could get back 
with
me ASAP, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Anita
