Subject: Beginning Hang Gliding

I don't want anyone to feel left out and please let me know if you don't want 
to see emails of this type in the future.  There is a beginning hang gliding 
class this weekend.  The class is offered through Leisure Learning 
Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, click 
on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll 
down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out 
more.

Here is the schedule;
Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th & 
5th.

The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The 
outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere.

Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending 
on which option you select.

Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up!
