I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport 
split out by East and Marketeast.

Colleen,
 
I'll get that info to you as soon as Chris Germany finishes revamping the 
East demand worksheets.

Thanks,
Crystal

No need to give it to me without that info--just get me a copy once you've 
reconstructed the spreadsheets.

Colleen,

I am unable to complete the Transport P&L for the Northeast Desk due to 
reconstruction on the spreadsheets where I gather my demand 
charges/reimbursements data. If you would like me to do the Transport P&L 
without that info, just let me know and I'll get that to you as soon as 
possible.

Thanks,
Crystal Hyde
