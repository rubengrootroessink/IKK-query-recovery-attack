Its ok to do the netout.  The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be 
changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they 
enter the pipeline statements in Unify.

If we've already discussed this excuse me. I just wanted to verify with you 
that New Power was okay in the system (download I sent you) so I can do the 
netout with them for this month.  Please let me know asap.


Thanks
Darla
