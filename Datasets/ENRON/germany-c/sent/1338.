Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Doug- Based on these numbers David's w/d from IBSS would be zero, due to
the AGL DSR.

Subject:  Updated Mar'00 Requirements



Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.
