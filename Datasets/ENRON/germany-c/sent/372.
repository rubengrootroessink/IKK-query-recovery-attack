Take a look at my worksheet and let me know what you think.  Look at column H 
in the Daily Activity tab, this shows my actual daily and monthly 
injections.  Also, on 9/16/200, we did a storage transfer to NIPSCO for 
500,000 dth.

Our total capacity is 6,050,607 dth.  We have all the tariff rules in the 
Strg Rules tab.
