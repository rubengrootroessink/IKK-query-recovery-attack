What did we do about this?  I'm thinking we let it flow.

Joann,

WGL (Shenandoah Gas) is under gas in/gas out restrictions through Monday.

Please bring in an extra 128 dth/day for 1/20 through 1/24 to CES EU.  For
today I've talked to WGL and we can bring the extra in on Cove Point.

Per my voice mail please let me know that today's increase will flow as soon 
as
possible as I have a customer that is waiting to see if he has to burn 
propane.

Thank you!
