28213

I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.

Est Citygate for Nov  43,213
Storage Withdrawal  15,000

Net Purchase from ENA  28,213


Does this look correct?

We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from 
New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).

AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are 
maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really 
need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone.
