If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from 
someone else.  The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.  And this was the only 
time we ever used the agency on CNG.

This is a Sithe Energies transaction and in no way has anything to do with our
Sithe/Independence transactions.  However, we need to make sure when the
contract is terminated, none of our Sithe/Independence contracts are 
affected. 
These other contracts are one ANR, PEPL, Union, TCPL, Empire, and NiMo.

Thanks, Diane
