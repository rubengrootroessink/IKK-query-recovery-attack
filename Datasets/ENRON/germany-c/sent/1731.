How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".  
That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine 
is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!

What's up with you girl?

See.... I'm being nice and not asking any other questions.

Hope you're doing okay.
