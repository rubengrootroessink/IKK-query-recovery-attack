Sorry Chris, I'm too efficient!  You told me to set it up and I did!  
Thursday afternoon @ 2.  Please let me know if you plan to attend so that I 
can get a conference room big enough for everyone.  Thanks!  md

CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur, 
or Fri.  

Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like 
to meet with CNG.  I may or may not be here.

Thanks
