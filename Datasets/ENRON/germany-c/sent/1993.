Let me know if you have questions.  I think we need to add Nov 2000.  

AND, according to Navigator, the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is 
2,973,373.  Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000, the balance is 3,013,373 which 
is about 49% of the total storage balance.  Is this a comfortable number or 
crititcal?

Joann, are there any special storage rules for Feb and March?  Are we 
required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001?
