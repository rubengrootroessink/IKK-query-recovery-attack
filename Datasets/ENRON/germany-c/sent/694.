Jeff;
I recommend that CES have ENA match the pricing for each package that has 
been bid.  This means that we will let the unbid portion of capacity remain 
under the posting.

Please copy me on your e-mail to ENA.  Thanks

This should do it. I believe the BGE Rate Schedule on CNG is GSS. Call if you
need more info.

I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon.  I will
see what he can offer to us in terms of of bundled delivered package.  ENA
has 23K a day going to Zone 5.  They should be willing to deal.  Is there
anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov 00 to Oct 01 by
zone and op, less the winter storage and SST that we own?  I need a good
idea what our needs are.  I could compile this myself but I am loaded up on
finalizing the deal on Monday.  Thanks

Surprisingly, 12,485 of our 15,500 dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out
for
bid, has been bid on for between the minimum, $5.171 and $5.1807. CES
currently
has it from 11/99 to 10/00 for $4.56.  We have until 7/6 to tell ENA, as
our
agent, to tell TCO whether we want to match those bids for the next year or
let
it go to the bidders.
Also here is an update on the non theoretical storage.
