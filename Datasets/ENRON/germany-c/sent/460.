The card was sincere... I didn't even talk about the most important person
in the card... that would be me!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Are you doing okay???

I'm still going to request for reimbursement for your travel expenses... but
just in case... we should probably book something cheap.

Oh great.  Lay the Dad guilt trip on me.  AND I just got your card
yesterday, another guilt trip think.

I think me flying back on 18th or 19th will be ok.  I'll verify afternoon
lunch and call you.
