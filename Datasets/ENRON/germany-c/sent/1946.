Subject: Trco Backhaul Rates

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

Re:  FT and IT Rates effective February 1, 2001


On January 24, 2001, the Commission issued an order in Docket
Nos. RP97-71-020 and RP97-71-021 which, among other things,
approved the pro forma tariff sheets included with the filing.
The Commission's order also directed Transco to file actual
tariff sheets to be effective February 1, 2001.  Transco intends
to file the revised tariff sheets with the Commission on February
1, 2001.  If accepted as proposed, outlined below for your
convenience are Transco=s Rate Schedule FT and IT rates effective
February 1, 2001.
