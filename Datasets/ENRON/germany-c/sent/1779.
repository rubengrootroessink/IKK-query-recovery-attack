Souad,
 As discussed, here is my list of current Enron Canada transactions with ENA 
that need to be converted in Sitara from Phys Fwd to D2D.  I would like to 
have all these deals converted effective April 1, 2001.  The Enron Canada 
Desk will be EC IM Canada West.  

Chris/Darron/Suzanne ;Any help you can give me on the  East/West Desk deals 
would be appreciated.
