Deal 225818 is a deal that was copied from deal 113293 and looks like we have 
been invoice EES at NX1 + .235 since 10/99.  If you have any other questions 
please get with me.

ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price 
of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is 
correct?

Thanks
