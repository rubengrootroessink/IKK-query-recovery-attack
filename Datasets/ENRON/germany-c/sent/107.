The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,



Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.
