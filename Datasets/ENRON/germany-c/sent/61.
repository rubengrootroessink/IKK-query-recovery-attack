If I made as much as those EES boys I could afford a Harley.  I have a 1995 
Yamaha Virago 1100.  I like it.  I got a tattoo of a heart with your name 
inside it.

Where I'm from, you and your Harley would fit in just fine.  How's things 
going for you?  Heard you are a big Harley owner now?  Well sorry I missed 
you but I'm sure I'll see you soon!

Oh be still my aching heart,
filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)

I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!!
