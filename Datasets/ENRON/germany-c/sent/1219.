We have had an unexpected death in my family, requiring me to be out of the 
office the rest of the week.   I am sorry the timing is so bad, I will 
contact Robert first thing next week and we can workout a game plan going 
forward.  Thanks for your patience...

The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with 
Chris Germany yesterday and to our knowledge these gathering contracts have 
never been set up in our systems.  

I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwein 
down on 30.  Actually, I think it would be a great idea to spend a few 
minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too far 
into the process and we discover that rework is being done.

I just meet with Gloria to decipher what the status is on all her E-mails.  
She's identified all the remaining rate changes needed for today's payments, 
the transport contracts needed to be setup, Sitara numbers needed for 
contracts already set up, and the meters needing to be linked to transport 
contracts.  I'm still fuzzy on this whole process and am not sure what Robert 
Allwein's 60 or 70 contracts relate to... are these purchase contracts?   
I'll be up shortly, working with Brenda... let's see if a meeting would be 
good.
