The gloves are off and the courtship begins - what's your work address?  
Valentine goodies are on the way.  I'm officially in love... with you!

Well Chris, you know what the problem is?  You never bought me that $25,000 
diamond ring you kept promising me.  You're all talk.

She doesn't know that I exist,  now that I'm single again and all.  I should 
be able to lose 30 or 40 pounds by then.
