Subject: Purchase from ENA

I bought 15,000/d at the TCO Pool from Dick J at $6.895 for 12/2 through 
12/31. At first he was concerned we were swinging on ENA and not storage and 
I assured him you folks knew what volume we buy/sell @ GD as soon as you get 
my nom. I have even included my estimate on the bottom of my daily nom sheet.
