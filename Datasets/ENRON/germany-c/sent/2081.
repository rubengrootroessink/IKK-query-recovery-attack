I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.  However, I do use meter numbers 
and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.  Deal 
241639 is (term purchase from AEC) is at this meter.  And deal 511043 (ENA-Im 
Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.  It 
doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set 
up in Sitara.

Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
 *  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
 *  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)?
 *   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
 *  Can this change take effect 1/1/2001?
 *  If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today, 
I'll buy him a "pop".

Kevin, I have included Chris Germany and Richard Pinion because they 
requested updates to facility #820006.  There is a note on this facility from 
Chris requesting this facility to be reactivated (10/28/99).  He would have 
to approve inactivation.  Richard requested a name change (4/25/00).

Chris is this still a valid point?

See Screen 3 - Facility #513423 appears to have been created in error.  The 
Norm and Trade flags are set to 'no'.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Faye

Screen 1 - Note requesting reactivation.

Screen 2 - Shows interconnect with different pipes.

Screen 3 - This facility appears to be created in error, both the Norm and 
Trade flags are set to 'No'.

820006 is set up in Global as an interconnect between NFUL and TCPL at 
Niagara Falls.  That is incorrect and this facility should  be changed or 
inactivated ASAP  before any more deals get booked against it.  I believe 
there is an interconnect between NFUL and TGP at Niagara.
Didn't we have this same problem in the spring regarding Facility#513423.

Kevin
