Good to hear from you.  Man I guess I'm just falling apart, physically and 
mentally.  Can't invest worth a crap either.  I'm going to start burying my 
money in a tin can somewhere.  I also keep thinking about buying a place 
and/or a new car.  But then I look at my $20.00 utility bill - thats a hard 
thing to ingnore.

Someones waiting for me here.  Chat with you later.
