The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the 
New Power Market Area.  We are still working on the East demand charges, they 
are not correct.  I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sales 
deal.

Is the $10,000/month scheduling fee part of the $1,193,725? Is the demand 
charge for all of the reimbursements on all pipelines combined?

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.
