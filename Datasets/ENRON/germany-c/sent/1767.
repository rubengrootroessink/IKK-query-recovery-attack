It's missing the demand charge.  I'll get you to rerun it for me in the

Please send me the Ogy invoice for March.  I did such a good job of doing my 
job that I think everything in the system is ok.  By the way - I'm on 
vacation for a week or so startig Friday.  I should have New Power updated by 
tomorrow.
