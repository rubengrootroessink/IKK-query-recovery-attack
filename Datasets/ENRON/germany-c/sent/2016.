I don't know if this was ever resolved but Susan Pereira's name is on the 
deal ticket.

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!
...Chuck
