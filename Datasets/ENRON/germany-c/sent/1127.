Subject: Two New EOL Locations

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having 
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if 
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE 
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will 
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There 
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these 
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission 
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG  
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is 
304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also 
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as 
possible.

If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN 
ADVANCE!!!!!!

Victor,
Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company 
are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.
Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner, 
in our group, will coordinate adding these locations
for EOL trading.
Thanks!

Subject: two new locations

Hey Jennifer,  How are you?

We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new 
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they 
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!
