RE:     2000 Winter Operations and 1Line Meetings

You are cordially invited to attend one of Transco's three regionally
scheduled 2000 Winter Operations and 1Line meetings.

The meetings are scheduled as follows:

November 7                      Newark, New Jersey              Hilton

Auditorium

This year's Winter Operations Meetings have been expanded to include a
variety of material that will be of interest to all customers. The meetings
will focus on three specific areas:  (1) the traditional update on
operational plans for the winter, maintenance outages planned for next year
and a customer service update; (2) a 1Line update and discussion on business

practice changes that will require tariff changes; and (3) a review and
discussion of the EDI and flat file datasets for nominations, confirmations
and schedule quantity reports targeted at those customers and their
information technology staff who have expressed an interest in this
information.  Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in
Washington
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation

of the 1Line system.  That meeting will be held in mid-November and
customers
will be notified as to time and location in the near future.

The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at
approximately 4:00 p.m.  Coffee, juice and pastries will be provided before
the meeting and lunch will be served at approximately 11:30 a.m.  The
Houston
meeting will start at 12:30 p.m. and end at approximately 5:00 p.m.
Refreshments will be provided mid-afternoon.

The agenda for the Newark and Charlotte meetings as well as the Houston
meeting is included below.  Please note that the agenda for the Houston
meeting is significantly different than the other meetings.

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 or via e-mail at
rosina.l.freeman@williams.com no later than Wednesday, October 25, 2000 so
that we can have an accurate count for each meeting.
If you have any questions, please call Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054.  We
hope to see you at
this event.

Sincerely,
Terry Fitch
Manager, Gas Operations
