Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you 
eliminate segmenting.

Example #1

Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary 
delivery point of PECO in Z6.
What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day 
of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from 
Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to 
Z6?


Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.

Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?
