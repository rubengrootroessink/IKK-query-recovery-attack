Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by 
my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO 
capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each 
month.  True?

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me 
at
315-460-4041.  Thank you.
