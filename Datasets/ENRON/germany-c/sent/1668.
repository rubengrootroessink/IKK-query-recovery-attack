Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by 
Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a 
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include 
it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.  
IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   
I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier 
I will be.  BE NICE NOW.
