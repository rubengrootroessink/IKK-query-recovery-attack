     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

     CNG Transmission Corporation

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.  
Therefore,
when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s 
obligation
to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210
dekatherms to 160 dekatherms.

     Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals
to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of
the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact me at 304-623-8546.
