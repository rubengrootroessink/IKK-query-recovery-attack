I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility. The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal 
schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks
