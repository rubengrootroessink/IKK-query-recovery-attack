I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.
