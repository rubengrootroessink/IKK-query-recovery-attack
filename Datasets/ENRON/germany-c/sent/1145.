What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.
