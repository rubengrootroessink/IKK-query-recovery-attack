 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 
4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a 
new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe 
that has already been done)?

I was not aware ot the Sonat Style.  In that case, an IT request is not 
necessary.

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to 
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change 
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound 
correct to you?

Please let me know.

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane
