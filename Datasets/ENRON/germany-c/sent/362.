Probably won't get to it until after the 1st is done.  I think it will be 
easy to figure out though.

Chris,

Have you been able to figure out if Enron has billed Ashland for Jan, Feb and
Mar on an old 1022/day Columbia contract?  If so, please let me know so we can
make the appropriate adjustment with the Ashland volumes.

Thanks
