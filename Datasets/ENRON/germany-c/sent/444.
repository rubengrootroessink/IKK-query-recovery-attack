               It's a Party and You're Invited


      Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
      Day:     Sunday, September 10
      Time:    4:00 p.m.
      Place:   Woods on Augusta (pool area)

     I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

     Please bring your own "Cheer".

     Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.
