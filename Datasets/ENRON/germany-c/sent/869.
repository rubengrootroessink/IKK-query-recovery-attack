Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave 
a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.
