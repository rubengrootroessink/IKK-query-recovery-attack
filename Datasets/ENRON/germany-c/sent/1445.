Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get 
there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to 
Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on 
Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights 
at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to 
Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down.
