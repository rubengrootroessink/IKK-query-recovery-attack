Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: 

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com) files should never be launched from 
email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
un-necessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an un-validated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.
