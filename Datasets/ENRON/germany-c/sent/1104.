What's the word Mr. Goodell?  I'm thinking there is no demand charge and this 
acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand.

This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with 
different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and 
should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand 
expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ? 

Thanks,
Brenda
