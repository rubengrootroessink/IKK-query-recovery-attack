I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some 
confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less 
and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS.

Chris,

Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that 
CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do 
they have the right to swing like that?

Dave

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.
