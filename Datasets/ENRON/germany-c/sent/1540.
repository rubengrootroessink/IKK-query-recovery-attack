I think we can change the ranks pretty easily.  As far as the business party 
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?) 
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was 
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking 
advantage of.  We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well.

Thanks, d.n.

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES 
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the 
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's 
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA    5304
Brooklyn Union   21995 
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various 
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we 
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert 
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a 
great deal of time 
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to 
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing 
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.
