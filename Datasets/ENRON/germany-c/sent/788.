It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks
cg 3-4743

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.
