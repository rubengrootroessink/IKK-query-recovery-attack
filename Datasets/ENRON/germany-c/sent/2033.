In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points.  
That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.  So you are 
telling me the "rules have changed"?  I can now flow 100% from secondary 
points?

You can use the full contract MDQ to move from and to secondary points.  Of
course,  this would be subject to any secondary restrictions.

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt
point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced
from Secondary receipt points?
