Chris, I whole heartedly agree....As a group we are preparing a 
presentation/lunch where we will get together with Volume Mgt. and Client 
Services and show how a good logistics/accounting team works...We(Bryce 
Baxter, Kathy Kelly and Ed Terry) are also encouraging the folks from 37 to 
spend an hour or two here in our world during scheduling and our folks also 
spending time with the folks in 37 so we can both understand each other's 
worlds......  If you want to discuss further, please let me know.......

I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together 
somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get 
in their groups and talk.

Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob 
Supperty about this,.
