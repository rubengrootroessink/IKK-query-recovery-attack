OK.  Now either Mary Theresa Franklin or Angie needs to path out this deal in 
Unify with a zero volume.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production 
or pool gas on CNG?

I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April.  

Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this.  
Also, send me your phone number.  I can't find it.
