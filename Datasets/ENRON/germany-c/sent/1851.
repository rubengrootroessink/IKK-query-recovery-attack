It's Circle Bible Study Time Again!.......and I sure hope you will be there.

Join us tomorrow night for another exciting episode of "As the Relationships
Turn".
This week we will investigate one of the keys to building strong
relationships.....learning to serve.

Join us for live jazz!, coffee, table fellowship, Bible study, and more!

Bring some friends with you.

"So Jesus called them to Him and said, 'As you know, the kings and great men
of the earth lord it over the people; but among you it is different.
WHOEVER WANTS TO BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT and whoever wants
to be greatest of all must be the slave of all.  For even I, the Messiah, am
not here to be served, but to help others, and to give My life as a ransom
for many.'"  Mark 10:42-45.

"The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."  Matthew
23:11-12

"Now came an argument among them as to which of them would be greatest (in
the coming Kingdom)!  But Jesus knew their  thoughts, so He stood a
little child beside Him and said to them, 'Anyone who takes care of a little
child like this is caring for  Me!  And whoever cares for Me is caring for
God who sent Me.  Your care for others is the measure of your greatness.'"
Luke 9:46-48 (TLB)

See you Saturday night!
