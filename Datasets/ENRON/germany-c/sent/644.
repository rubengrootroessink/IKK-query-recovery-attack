New Power Company will be formally taking over the CES-Retail Agreement 
effective 7/31/00.  Who should be responsible for changing all the deals in 
Sitara to correctly reflect the new arrangement?    Please advise.

Mark:
I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services 
Corporation's sale of its "Mass Markets" business to The New Power Company.  
The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 
Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master 
Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under 
it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we 
will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.
