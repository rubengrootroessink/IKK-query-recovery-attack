Do you need anything else from me regarding Sea Robin ?     I will be in the 
office tomorrow morning - let me know if I should bring anything with me that 
you need to see on Sea Robin.

I need to get our most recent bills for Sea Robin.  I show a contract #FSRP3, 
MDQ = 25,000, and a demand of $56,498
