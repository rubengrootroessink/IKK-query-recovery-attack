Doesn't look too good right now.  I forgot about the HPL people.  I think we 
already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many 
HPL people are staying with Enron on the trading side.  I'll keep you posted.

If you are bud's with Scott Hendrickson, he would be a good one to talk to.  
I don't want to mention your name unless I hear of something.
