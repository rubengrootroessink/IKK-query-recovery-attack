Noel Bartlo would talk to the Fuel Management Reps and work deals to use the 
idle capacity. Listed below is what is currently idle.

Who     Contract # Rec Delivery Cap Idle
International Paper/Union Franklin 62076  A03 CGV1-34 755 755
International Paper/Union Franklin 62077  A03 CGV1-34 7400 7400
International Paper/Union Franklin 62077  A01 CGV1-34 7400 393
Aristech Chem    63895  Leach COH3-15 18500 18184
Bethlehem    no idle capacity (spot deals using it right now)
Allied Signal    no idle capacity
Alliance Tubular   no idle capacity

Since Enron is not using all of CES contracts, did not look at Columbia Gulf 
(Mainline), 

Fuel Management Reps for CES:
Fred Lombardo  Int Paper/Bethlehem Steel 724-873-1300
John Whited  Aristech Chem   724-873-1300
Lee Tippet  Allied Signal   614-481-1160

Before doing deals, please check with me to ensure this capacity is still 
available.

Let me know if you need anything else.
