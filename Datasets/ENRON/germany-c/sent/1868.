Subject: TMR earnings released

7th straight record quarter...
 TMR out of tax deferrals so revenue  was 'only ' $.24 per share / $1.07 for 
year.
This does not include the 25 % of shares they took off market - that will be 
factored
 into first qtr '01.  No reduction  in production for year - and looking for 
increase
in gas production for '01.
   Still looks good for long term...we'll see what it does the rest of this 
week....
