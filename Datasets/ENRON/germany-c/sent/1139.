I agree, you stay home.  He didn't have any info on the test.
He was ready to go.,

MMM, sounds like Pops and a good ideal.   Guess you got out of taking him out 
to
eat again.   What did you say to him and did they tell him anything on the 
bone
scan.

I'm running a temp today and threw up a bunch last night.   If I don't shake
this stuff before tomorrow, I'm not coming for the Dr. meeting.   I really do
not want to give this crap to DAD.  Would not be a good way to start 
treatment.

Pop's just called me.  He's done with his testing and he's going nuts staying 
in
the Hotel.  He is going home now, and will drive back tomorrow for the test
results.
