Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 
(in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on 
a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on 
Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  

The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle.  
E Town
N Jersey
PSE&G
Con Ed
Lilco
Bug
Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco)
Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)

Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin 
at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.

Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how 
much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.

Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream 
of Lambertiville.
