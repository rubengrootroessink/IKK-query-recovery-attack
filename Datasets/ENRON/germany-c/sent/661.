Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve 
CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any 
gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.  Per Marde, 
CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.

OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.
