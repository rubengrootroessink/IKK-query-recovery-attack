I bet you think I have been ignoring you, right?  Does this mean I don't have 
to read all those emails you sent me?

Subject: Rates Corrections

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.
