I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.

Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas 
from CES at GD - $.005

Let me know if you have questions.

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

Thanks

In case anyone cares.... did the SIT withdrawal nom's to Allied Plant on the 
FTS idle capacity. Effective 3/24 to 3/29. This will better help match the 
burns for Allied.

39095/84 was = 0  now = 12163
62672/13 was = 0   now = 2837

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or 
15,000/day, effective 3/24 to 3/29.

39095/124  was = 12809/12426/12163 now = 0  (super nom from mainline pool to 
Allied plant)
37862/14  was = 0    now = 12809/12426 (mainline to leach)
37147/2478 was = 0   now = 12426/12426 (leach to TCO)
62672/12  was = 3405/3333  now = 507/496 (TCO agg to Allied plant)

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

39095/14  12163 reduction
62672/12  2837  reduction

Total  15,000 reduction

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
