You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you 
come back.

Well, they put me on this special audit team to research anything that Chris 
Germany transacted.  (Not really, just kidding!!!)  

I just decided that it is time for a change and an opportunity came up.  I 
was in Gas Settlements for a little over a 1 1/2.  Don't worry, Mary will 
take care of you!!  By the way, Darla Saucier will be handling the The New 
Power Company counterparty.  Please work w/ Darla and Mary for November, 2000 
business.  It was fun working w/ you.  Take care.

Why did you go to power?  Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I 
made back in 1994??
