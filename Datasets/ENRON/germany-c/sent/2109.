Show Judy this.
We cannot let you balance your mdq across the month but we can offer a low
IT discount rate on top of the firm.  (this equates back to the effective
rate you were looking for.  You can change the amount of firm higher if you
like and then the ratio of IT at the cheap rate will also incease.  Your
cheap IT rate can be up to a volume of 50% of your firm.   After that it
would be max rate it.

I will be out this afternoon and Thursday but will call you from the road.

Does GRI go from $.0072 to $.0070 in January?

And I love that outfit you are wearing.
