Look at the FOM numbers.  I'm using your number from cell R40 and take a look 
at how I come up with my numbers.

Date JP FOM FOM Sell to ENA Buy from ENA Sell to ENA Other Purchases FOM 
Adjusted
1 28498  44283 -11000  0  0  11317   44600
2 43498  44283 -11000  15000  0  11317   48283
3 43498  44283 -11000  15000  0  11317   48283
4 43498  44283 -11000  15000  0  11317   48283
5 38498  44283 -11000  15000  -5000  11317   43283
6 38498  44283 -11000  15000  -5000  11317   43283

This is a breakout of the "Other Purchases".  These are gross numbers
1252  A06 from Dominion
4099  Broad Run from EES
3674  Delmont form EES
688    Monclova from Central Desk
1857 A06 from ENA

11570  Gross = 11,317 delivered

This is how I get your FOM for the 1st +44283-11000+11317=44600

Let me know what you think about my voodoo.

1  4087 
2    5999

I buy the Undertakes and sell you the Overtakes.

Do these numbers look  close?
