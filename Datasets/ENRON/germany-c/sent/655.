Yep.  Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.  Took my woman and went to 
Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ 
pit.  I was very tired on Wed though.

Not a problem.  She can stuff the little sucker if I get all the other
stuff.  I'll start working on that 50 lbs right after I finish this cookie.

I try and negotiate that for you.  Also, I think you need to think about
sharing custody of your son since you will be so close.

Not hardly.  Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying
licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?  I will also need to travel
back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family.

Hey I think that if you loose 50 lbs, I can make it happen for you.  But
you
might have to move to Denver.  Is that a problem?
