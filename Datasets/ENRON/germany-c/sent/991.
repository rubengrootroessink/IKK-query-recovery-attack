Not bad.  Went to a John Zurita fish fry.  I rode to John's house with a 
power guy that lives in my complex and we stayed about 1 1/2 hours longer 
than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle 
brace and tennis shoes to work.  I start my 1st therapy session tomorrow.

I sent this picture on to the girls I know.  Laura is a recruiter and she
said she will jump right on it.  Get ready for a hot date.
