The demand charges match what ENA was billed by the pipeline.

Chris,

Have you had a chance to look at this yet?  It sound like NIMO is still 
willing to pay the fair amount, we just need to make sure that we actually 
bill them.  Let me know how I can help.

Kate

Chris,

Can you take a look at the attached spreadsheet that NIMO has sent regarding 
demand charges due Enron and we have not billed.  Kate and I are not sure if 
this has been billed correctly and wanted to verify with you.  Please advise.

I can be reached at 713-853-7912.

Phil,

Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you.  The following spreadsheet
outlines the amounts we owe you for each production month.  This shows you
the exact charges we are to pay along with how much credit we are due in
each production month.  Each MARQ and FTNN charge on CNG Demand is credited
on our monthly CNG Demand billing.  This is showing us that you should have
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should
bill us these amounts.

               (Embedded image moved to file: pic07770.pcx)

If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me
by e-mail or you may call me at (315) 460-4122.  These amounts are showing
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid.  When billing,
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the
mail.  According to our contracts, we need an original invoice complete
with wire instructions in order to make payment to your company.

Sincerely,

Becky E. Morrow
Fuel Clerk of Gas Supply
