Good for you.  I haven't bought my camera yet.  I probably will do it this
weekend.  I got a coupon for 10% off this weekend at Best Buy.  I am looking
at an cannon either the elph s200 or a s10 (I think those are the right
numbers)

Jerry and I bought motorcycles.  I LIKE!

Are you still looking at getting a camera - an ELPH??  Is that a digital?
