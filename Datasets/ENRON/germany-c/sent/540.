Please send those to Scott Goodell and he will get them to the right person.  
I believe ENA should be paying all those bills effective 1/1/2000.

Scott's address is 
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, TX 77251-1188

His number 713-853-7711

thanks.

Subject: Outstanding Invoices


Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.
