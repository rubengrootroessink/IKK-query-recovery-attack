You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one 
is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's 
contracts to ENA.

Everything looks fine with one exception.  The contract at the bottom (K# 
61825) should have already been in ENA's name starting Nov-00 through 
Oct-2001.  PLEASE CONFIRM THIS .

Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for 
November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown 
in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I 
won't execute these until I hear from you.











The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff 
gave us the OK on this one.
