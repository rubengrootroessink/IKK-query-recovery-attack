Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep doing 
it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing Texas 
Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on Tuesday.  I 
may be going Tues afternoon.  

When do you leave Houston?

Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.

There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.

I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and Tuesday.
Hope to see you.

Hope your back and other aches are okay.
