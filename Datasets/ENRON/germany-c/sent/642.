Subject: REIMBURSEMENT MEETING


Please make every effort to attend the following brain storming meeting 
regarding creating new capture, settlements and reporting
needs for reimbursements.  I have had some discussions with many of you on 
this matter and would like to get together to discuss 
some potential options for this subject.

Changes needed will involve SITARA, UNIFY, reports, and CPR/UNIFY bridges.

Where: EB32C2
When:  Thursday July 13 - 10:30 to 1:00 pm 
Lunch will be provided.

Please R.S.V.P.

Let me know if you have any questions.
