Chris,

I just wanted to follow up on this.  We must settle this by Friday for 
correct payment on Monday.

Thanks.

Chris,

Bill Murray of Columbia Gas of Ohio called and stated that the Demand Charge 
that is a part of deal #213360 has already been paid by Enron as a put or 
option premium in Apr-00.  He is stating that it should not be part of this 
month's charges.  Please advise and/or change this deal to reflect your 
understanding as to the correct charges on this invoice to Columbia.  

Please respond to both Janine Cashin and I.  She is the new coordinator for 
this account and will ultimately settle with Columbia.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
