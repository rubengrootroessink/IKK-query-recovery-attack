Hey Chris,

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
you know!

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
kinda rough for

you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!


I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that "Tom Hermanic" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
Northeast/CNG

scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
position via

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
I could contribute

immediately.

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

   Sincerely,......Alain
