Carol Herman said the mdq is 10,000 and the rate is $4.9473.  
Chris please look at the deal in sitara, I copied the October deal that had a 
reservation volume of 360,000.

I entered the VNG Cove Point contract FPS1001 in sitara. 
The deals are as follows:

484687 Im Market East
484689 Im East
I have a call into Transco's Carol Herman to get the correct rate.
