I will be in Port Aranasas Friday morning.  I should be back in Houston by
2:00 PM and I will have my cell phone turned on for the trip home.  I don't
have voicemail on my cell phone.  But, if anything should happen, you could
leave me a voicemail at home and I will check it once every hour after 1:00
PM on Friday.
