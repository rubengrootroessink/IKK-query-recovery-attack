Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production?  
According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to 
the bill.  He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might 
have been some Michcon activity missing.

Hi Chris,

Please give me a call this afternoon and let me know if you've had a chance 
to look over the deals for october that Mary Ellenberger emailed to you last 
week. I would like to get this matter resolved this week. 

Thanks
Darla
