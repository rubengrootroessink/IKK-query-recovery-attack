I will need to see the CGAS invoices for Dec when we get them.  According to 
New Power, we should have overrun charges.

That makes sense.  So you really are not using any ENA space but then I need 
to check the overrun charges on the invoice.  If its ok with you, I think 
I'll just wait to review the invoice before I do anything with that.

I know we overan SST in COH.  Our nom was lower, but the retro increased. 
Alvin & Joanne were checking TCO. We are hoping they don't cut us and don't 
want to tip them that they could.
