Chris,
I am turning the Hunt Petroleum deals for the East desk over to Tricia 
Truong.  When you find out who we are suppose to pay for the deals below, you 
can let her know.

Tricia,
Pam will get with you about the Koch piece.

I am told that you are the one to ask about CES deals.  I have some CES deals 
for Hunt Petroleum that Hunt says they should not be paid for.  The details 
are below.  I am trying to find out who to pay.

There are three deals entered under Hunter Petroleum which Hunt says should 
not be paid to them.  Deal 136863 they say should be paid to Aviare Energy.  
Deal 136835 and deal 136845 they say should be paid to Hassie Hunt.  Can you 
tell me who we are suppose to pay for these meters?  Their payment is due on 
Monday, so whatever you can tell me today would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan
