Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to 
check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?

I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's 
GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about 
the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals 
in Sitara.

Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara.
