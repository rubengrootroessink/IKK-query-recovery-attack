I just checked and I don't have any daily information.  I know they sent it 
to me, I must have tossed it by mistake.

Chris,
 Did you find any dailies that would have gone with this invoice from Egan?  
Unify volumes do not tie and I called Jenny Nguyen yesterday and left her a 
voice mail, but have not heard back yet.  

Please, let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo
