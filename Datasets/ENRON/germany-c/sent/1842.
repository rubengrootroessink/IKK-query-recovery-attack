I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming 
back from Jerry's yesterday.  I kept getting a message like "We're sorry, 
this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers"  or something 
like that.  I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a 
couple of weeks ago.
