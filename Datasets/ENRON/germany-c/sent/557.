Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it 
because of email problems.  It was in my "save as a draft" folder.


ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy
