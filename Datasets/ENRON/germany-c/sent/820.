New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".

If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the
greatest cartoon ever.
