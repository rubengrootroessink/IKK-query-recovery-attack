I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think 
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example, 
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
working).

Thanks.
