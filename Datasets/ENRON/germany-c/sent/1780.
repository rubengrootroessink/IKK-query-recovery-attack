I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance 
trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I 
asked her to call me back.

Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz 
is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this 
issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me 
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.

Thanks
Laurie

No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess 
(formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email 
is jbieltz@hess.com.  Thanks for your help.

Laurie

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.
