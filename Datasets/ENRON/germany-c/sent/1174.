The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.
