Subject: Curve for Zone 1 Market

I would like to know what curve would you like setup for Zone 1 Market.  
Although you told me on the phone, I need documentation.

 
 Pipe  Zone   Intramonth  Mid   Gas Daily

 TGT  Zone 1 Markets         ???   ???       ???
 
Currently available:
 
 TGT  - Zone 0 FT Pool   IF - TGT/ZSL  IF - TGT/ZSL  GDP - TGT/ZSL
  Zone 0 FT Pool    
  Zone 0 IT Pool  
  Zone 0 Points  
  Zone 1 FT Pool
  Zone 1 IT Pool
  Zone 1 Points


These zones have the same mapping on TGT.  Would you like Zone 1 Markets 
mapped the same way?  Please respond soon because I am leaving at 2:00 PM 
today and I will be out of the office next week (39222).

Chao!
