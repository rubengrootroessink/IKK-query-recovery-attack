No, I'm not buying.   I reviewed my credit card receipts this week and I 
bought
last.  Yawl's turn.

Don has brought me lots of checks, one for $1800 on farm equipment, $3000 from
Gerald for cows, (I think we are suppose to hold this check) and $5900 for
selling the cows.   You want me to hold this till we talk Thursday night.  I
have the checks in my Freezer on ice so they will not be hot.   I can 
continue t
hold or deposit into the account.   Your call Bub.  Also have some on Dad's 
mail
that Don dropped off.

Barb and I will be going up Friday to Alto to check out the place, mow and 
weed
eat etc.   I'll grab the mail and I have Don's check for $10,000 to Mary.   
I'll
probably go by and drop flowers on Dad's grave.

How was your trip?  Did you miss me?   You by a motorcycle YET?   I have not
really looked yet.   Sold the four wheeler to Don for $4000 plus the trailer.
I did not really need it and he asked if I wanted to sell it.

Got the insurance check from Met Life.   I signed it and put my account # on 
it
to deposit after church Sunday morning.  Stuck it and my offering check in my
wallet.  They took up the offering so I pulled out my check and put it in the
offering plate.  When I handed the offering plate to the usher, I noticed
writing on my check, then it hit me, WRONG CHECK.   Barb said my face turned
dark purple and eyes looked like watermelons.    I was stammering, wait wait,
wrong check!   Whooo, that was a close one.   Thought you might enjoy that 
one.

Hey Dow stock is an excellent buy at $24.00.   If we do not buy a scooter 
soon,
I'm going to invest a little in the Dow Stock.

Talk to you this afternoon once you are settled back in.  See Ya
