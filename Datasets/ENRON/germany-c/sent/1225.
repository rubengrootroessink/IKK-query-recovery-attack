Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files 
"febsaleinv1.xls" and "febsaleinv2.xls" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to 
CES for the month of Feb.  The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I 
keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport 
pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in 
this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual 
process.

I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the 
pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data 
in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.

Thanks.

Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file.  
I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with 
you later today.



Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet.
