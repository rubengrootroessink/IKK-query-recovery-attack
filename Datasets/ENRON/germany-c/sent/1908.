				[IMAGE]				Markets Responding to Order 637 Price Cap Removal. 
								
								CapacityCenter.com research results show that the pipeline capacity release 
marketplace is responding positively to the price cap removal provisions of 
Order 637. 
								
								A look at the past few months reveals an increase of almost 500% in the 
number of over-max-rate deals since the months just after the ruling went 
into effect. Traders and contract owners alike are taking advantage of new 
opportunities.
								
								The research shows an overall increase in the size, duration and pricing of 
the release deals, indicating that many sellers prefer to be paid directly 
for their contracts rather than incur the risk involved in the purchase, 
transport and delivery of gas in order to generate margin.
								
								Capacity release trading is starting to mirror the more competitive 
marketplace, which is what the FERC hoped for in countering the "bundled 
deal" gray market.
