Should we just take the capaity for Feb and March or do you want to release 
the whole term then recall it later?

Hello Chris,

Columbia of Maryland now recognizes New Power as the supplier of the old CES 
customers.  Therefore, as of today, CMD assigned a whopping one dekatherm on 
Gulf and TCo to New Power, instead of to ENA, from Rayne to CMD city gate.

I executed the agreements and will release them to you assuming that it's 
okay to do so when I get the chance tomorrow.  I'd like to keep all of the 
capacity that ENA is managing together.  Let me you if you have any problems 
with that.
