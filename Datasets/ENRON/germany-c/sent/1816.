Subject: TCo and Gulf Capacity for April 2001

Chris,

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be 
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.  We have talked to 
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them:

CMD & CVA
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you.  
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001.  
New Power will execute it at that time.  This should happen late this week or 
early next week.

CPA
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.  Can you 
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as 
possible effective April, 2001?

COH
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and 
corresponding SST contracts.  They both expire in March 2001.  Therefore 
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.

There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH 8-35 
Pittsburgh (K#:  67694) that should be permanently released to New Power at 
max rates effective April, 2001.  

There are, I believe, about seven contracts (K#'s:  68918, 68915, 69148, 
69693, 68916, 68917, 69149) with primary receipt point(s) in the Toledo agg 
area.  The primary delivery points are 5-2 Parma, 5-7 Sandusky, and 7-4 
Alliance.  These contracts need to be permanently released to New Power at 
the following rates:
 68918 - $5.171
 68915 - $5.171
 69148 - $5.171
 69693 - $5.171
 68916 - $5.181
 68917 - $5.181
 69149 - $5.181

Let me know that this okay.
