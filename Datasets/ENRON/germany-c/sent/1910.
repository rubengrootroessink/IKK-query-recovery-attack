I wuzn't invited to the wedding.  AND when you sit down and think about the 
hedges and transport stuff, you will be surprised at how much stuff you 
remember.

The quickest way to learn transport???  Get copies of the invoices.

And guess what, I got another compliment on my sweat pants  on Saturday!!!
