Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.  Take a look at my 
worksheet.  All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale.  
Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.

What about deal 202939?  Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very 
confusing the way I do it.
