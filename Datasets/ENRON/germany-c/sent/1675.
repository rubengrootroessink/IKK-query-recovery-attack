I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to 
remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.

Mr. Germany - following are my notes per info Darla sent me:
Invoice corrections:
 Purchases on 4/9 should be zero.
 Transport charge is OK =  $11,274.31
 I do not see the demand charge in the invoice...
 Also need to add a credit cashout for 12dt's at cashout price.
I will be back in on Wednesday. 

Thanks Darla for sending this - don't let Mr Germany - slack off next week.
