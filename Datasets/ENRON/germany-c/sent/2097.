Guess Who???  Its back on my desk.  How do you feel about doing a manual 
invoice?  That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point.

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.


Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Darla
