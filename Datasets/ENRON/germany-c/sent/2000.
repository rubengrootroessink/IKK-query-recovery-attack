These rates are correct and I'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool (no 
surcharges).  Zone 4 to 4 is the most expensive zone on the pipe, Zone 5 runs 
a close second.  Are you sure you want 4 instead of 4a (mobile bay)?

could you please tell me what the above rates are?  i have been told they are 
$0.1716 and 1.9% fuel, but that seems high.

thanks
