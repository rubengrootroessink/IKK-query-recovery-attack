Chris--The attached file contains our daily requirements for 3/6 and 3/7.
Please call me if there is a problem with scheduling the volumes indicated.
The AGL numbers in this spreadsheet may not be correct and the numbers 
provided
by David Scott to Scott Goodell for today and tomorrow should be used instead
of the ones shown here.   Later today, around 4PM eastern time, I will send 
you
an update if there are any changes.
