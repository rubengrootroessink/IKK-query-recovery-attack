Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.  I spot checked some of 
the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are 
missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX 
purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS 
until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next 
week.  The dollar impact should be very small.

Remember, I'm out next week.
