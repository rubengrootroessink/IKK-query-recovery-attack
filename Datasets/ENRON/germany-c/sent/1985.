I will send these as I find them.  This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the 
April 2000 manual invoice.  It looks like the only deals that should have 
been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales.

Line 7 under the "Manual Invoice" tab applies to deal 268094, volume of 
615600 at $3.1279, sale to CES for Proxy storage injections.
Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113, sales to CES at the citygate.
Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to 
swing.  Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on 
deals 227081 and 227113.
Line 9????  I still can't figure out what I did here.

I think everything else is sorta clear.
