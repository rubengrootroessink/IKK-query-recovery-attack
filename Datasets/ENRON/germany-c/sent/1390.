Chris-

(It's Clayton, on my UT account from home)

I may have the perfect girl for you; she's a 29-year old *beauty* in
Ukraine, one of my wife's best-friends, about 5'2" in height, slim,
smart but a bit quiet and introspective, who really wants to meet a
quality guy and get married and have children. She had her heart broken
by her first love, a guy who dumped her for a girl in Kiev whose father
gave the guy a good job. It seems the quality guys, as few as they are,
all want to marry a rich girl and want only money andnot children.

I'll bring a picture of her by your office tomorrow.

One hang-up- she doesn't speak English very well (yet). But, where
there's a will, there's a way.

Clayton
