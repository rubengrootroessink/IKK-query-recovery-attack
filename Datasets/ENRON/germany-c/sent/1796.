Subject:  New Report

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports 
that
they can run.  The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well.  Only reports that are available to all 
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file 
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet).  Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started 
with
the various billing report options.  Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything.  Good 
idea!
