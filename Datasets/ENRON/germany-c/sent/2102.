Re:     System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative
transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its
system over the past several days.  As of December 21, 2000, Shippers
are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances as soon as
possible.

Additionally, until further notice, Transco will institute more
restrictive practices at its pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4%
tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for
Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will continue to be held
to the 4% tolerance levels.  Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified
above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may proactively decrease
markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points.

Absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may be required to
use any remedies available, up to and including reliance upon Section 52
of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff, to
ensure it retains the appropriate level of operational flexibility.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-3361 or
John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.
