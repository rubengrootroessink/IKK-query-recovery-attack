Cindy & Chris, 
I have sold the Equitrans metered production flowing into our Equitrans pool 
for a one year period to Dominion Field Services beginning November 1, 2000.  
Dominion will take whatever the Equitrans monthly estimate is.  I will do the 
deal sheet and have Terry Franklin input into Sitara.
John
