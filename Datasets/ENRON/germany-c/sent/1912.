Subject: Thursday Meeting


In preparation for the upcoming book change, the East desk would like to 
invite you to an informal discussion and Q&A session that will make this 
transition easier for everyone.  We will be disussing the following:

How deals are entered and valued in the system
How to read and understand reports
How to effectively communicate transactions

This would be a great opportunity to ask questions or voice any concerns.  
The meeting will be on Thursday, February 15 at 3pm in Room 3268. It should 
last around 30 minutes.  

Thank you,
East Desk
