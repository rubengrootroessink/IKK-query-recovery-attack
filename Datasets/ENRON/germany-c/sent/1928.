From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  "A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick
  occasionally.
