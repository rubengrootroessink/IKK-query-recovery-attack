I'm glad Beverly's coming to Transco.? I bet she'll do fine.? We can use some 
good people! 

Someone told me once before that they got that message from my phone.? While 
it is true that I usually don't pick up when caller id sez "unknown," I've 
never called the phone co. and asked them to attach that message to my line.? 
Go figure.? Next thing you know it'll be telling people something else about 
me like, "Sorry that number does not accept calls while the lady of the house 
is taking a d---."

Still haven't heard from mom on that Dr.?? I'll let you know.?? ??????? :)?
