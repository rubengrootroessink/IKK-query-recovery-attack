This has been, and still is a serious problem.  There are some reports and 
information I can't get to 
now because of it.  I'm working with Transco on it.

Chris and Judy,
Please pass on to any of your folks who need to know that we've completed
the name change from Enron Cap & Trade to Enron North America.  Your new
business party number is 7973.
Let me know if any problems arise.  Thanks.   ii
