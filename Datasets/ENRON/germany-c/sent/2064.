I believe I entered all the purchases New Power made for January 2001.

Deal  Volume  Comment
551050  14824  Purch from EES at A3, Maumee
551052  2374  Purch from EES at AO6
551053  1600  Purch from ENA at A06
551056  4000  Purch from EOG at Broad Run
551058  3674  Purch from EES at Delmont, the deal ticket is at the wrong 
meter number.  I sent a request for a new meter to Global facilities.

Whew, I think thats it.  Deal 551058 will need to fixed next week.  I'll do 
if I remember.
