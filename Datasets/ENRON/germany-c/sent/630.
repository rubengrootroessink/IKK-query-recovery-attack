  RE: Organizational Announcement
  Date: July 14, 2000

  I am pleased to announce the appointment of Paul F. Egner,
III to Director, Customer Services & Scheduling for the Transco pipeline
system. In his new position, Paul will oversee Transco's Northern and
Southern Market Area, Transportation Marketing, Scheduling, Electronic
Development & Commerce, Market Area Operations Accounting, Production Area
Operations Accounting and Imbalance Control.

  This new opportunity comes in recognition of the tremendous
job Paul has done while serving as Director, Gas Management & Control for
Transco, a position he has held since 1997. Prior to that, Paul held various
management positions of increasing responsibility in Gas Control, Customer
Service and Transportation Marketing. Egner joined Transco's engineer
training program in 1984, completing assignments in the Transmission
Department's Corpus Christi division office and in Offshore Pipeline Design.

  His experience in these various areas within Transco make
him an ideal candidate for this position.

  Please join me in congratulating Paul on this well-deserved
appointment.
