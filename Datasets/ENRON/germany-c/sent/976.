The reason for my question is due to a comment in cell 34 S of spreadsheet 
that says, "For Retail needs".

NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract.

Chris,
Do you invoice CES Retail for the monthly and volumetric demand paid by ENA 
to CALP?

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Comments/questions?

This contract is on the ECT April spreadsheet under CES Wholesale.  What is 
the relationship between ENA and Commonwealth Atlantic?
(Who pays transport invoice?  Any reimbursements?)

Thanks,
Brenda
