Con Ed released Transco space to EES.  The offer # is 21535, volume = 10,0000 
dth, demand charge = $1.50, term = 9/1/2000 - 9/30/2000.

Con Ed did the release pre arranged, non-biddable. 

Paul, you should be able to execute this space before 9:00 am and re-release 
it to me (company #7973).  

thanks.
