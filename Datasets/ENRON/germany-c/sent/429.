Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!
