Hey Chris,

Ken told me you called.  He thinks it was about some "deal".  But I know
better.

I haven't heard anything back yet, from the Enron NA group, but Tom Hermanic
sp? from HR
called me as I was walking out for lunch (I think in regards to EES).  I'll
be calling him back later today.

I'll keep you posted Chris.
