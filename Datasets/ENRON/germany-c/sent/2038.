Good point.  Is that also Bear Creek storage?  The tax bill specifically 
states Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I also left a voicemail for our tax guy.  
There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority 
comes up with their number.  I would like to see it but I bet it takes a 
while to get the support.

I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.  We have some type of deal 
with NOPSI.  Any other ideas on that?

Have you confirmed that this isn't for Tennessee Valley Supply Group (TVSG) 
storage volumes, which ENA purchased from CES?

I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for 
gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.  The amount is $5,606.78 and 
it is for the the 2000 tax year.  I was notified about this yesterday and I 
think it was due on 12/31/2000.

How do you want to handle this?  I was going to pay it and bill New Power for 
the whole amount.  I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.

Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax 
bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.

Thanks
