Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the 
pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual 
invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

Can the Sitara ticket be updated to match this invoice?
