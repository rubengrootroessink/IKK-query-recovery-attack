"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"
