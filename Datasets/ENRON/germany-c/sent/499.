We paid parking fees to Iroquois for 9905 and 9906 production months:

May 1999 $1,934.42       <- included in a wire on 6/18/99 for $1,498,033.81.
June 1999 $1,872.02       <- included in a wire on 7/22/99 for $1,393,799.19.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Chris
