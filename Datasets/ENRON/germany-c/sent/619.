will be refreshed

and be

Be a

  > > 3.   CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER.  Make one last trip through the
main part of

schoolbooks,
 > toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your
husband will

you a

  > > 4.   PREPARE THE CHILDREN.  Take a few minutes to wash
the children's
 > hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if
necessary,

to see

  > > 5.   MINIMIZE THE NOISE: At the time of his arrival,
eliminate all noise

quiet.
 > Greet him with a warm smile and kiss, letting him know you're glad
to see

  > >
  > > 6.   Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems or
complaints. Don't
 > complain if he's late for dinner.  Count this as minor compared
with what

  > >
  > > 7.   MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE.  Have him lean back in a
comfortable chair or
 > suggest he lay down in the bedroom.  Have a cool or warm drink
ready for
 > him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.  Speak in
a low,
 > soft, soothing and pleasant voice.  Allow him to relax and unwind.
  > >
  > > 8.   LISTEN TO HIM: You may have a dozen things to tell
him, but the
 > moment of his arrival is not the time.  Let him talk first.
  > >
  > > 9.   MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not
take you out to
 > dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to
understand his
 > world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax.
  > >
  > > 10.  THE GOAL: try to make your home a place of peace
and order where
 > your husband can relax.
