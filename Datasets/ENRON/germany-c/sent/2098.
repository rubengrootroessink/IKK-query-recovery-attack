I changed the term on deal 510007.

Steve, this is CNG contract #100104 for 15225 dth day.  The primary receipt 
point on this capaity is storage.  Is this a Nov-Mar deal or is this capacity 
good all year?



Brenda, what are the rules for setting up VNG demand charges?  Also, we are 
releasing most (not all) of the VNG space to ENA effective 1/1/2001.  Should 
I set up ENA - Im VNG as the primary desk for demand charges?
