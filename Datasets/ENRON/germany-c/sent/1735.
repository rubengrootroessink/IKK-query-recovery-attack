This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a 
shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.

Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k.  How does the grass look up at
Dad's.  I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay.  I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Be Safe!

Yo Bro,

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun
at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't
buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.
See what you can find me.

I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.
