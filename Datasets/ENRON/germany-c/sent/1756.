You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma 
Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times if 
I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was married 
with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.

I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short 
around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost 
$185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy 
that makes me.

I'm gonna go pout now.
