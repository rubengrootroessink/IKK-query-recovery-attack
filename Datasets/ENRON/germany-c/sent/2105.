Cindy, take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in 
the pool.  We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see 
what Dominion is producing.  We will not have this gas for January.

December 11, 2000

Weather forecasts reflect an extended period of steady, cold weather
throughout the pipeline system.  Therefore, in order to preserve line
pack and system reliability, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TETCO) is
imposing the following restrictions effective Gas Day December 21,2000 @
9:00 AM:

     -    no forward haul main-line IT-1 delivered to the market area.
     -    no due shipper imbalances are available
     -    TABS-1 parties are required to be in balance daily.
     -    Suspension of all non-interstate OBA's upstream of the BERNE (BER)
          Ohio Compressor station

These restrictions are in place until further notice.

TETCO is continually monitoring pipe conditions against current and
expected demand. TETCO will post as soon as possible if conditions
warrant secondary restrictions going into the holiday weekend.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
