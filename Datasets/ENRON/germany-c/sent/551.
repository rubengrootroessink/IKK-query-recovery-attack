Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The 
worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".  Assume the rate you are looking at 
is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking 
at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify 
is the filename "2000tran08".

Hey Chris,

Remember me????  I was wondering if you have an excel file where you keep
track of all the rates and fuels for your desk. If you do....can I get a copy.
I have my old one for
the Central desk pipelines but one for the NE would help. 

I was planning to create one of my own, but I figured why 'reinvent the 
wheel.'



Thanks 

Maria
