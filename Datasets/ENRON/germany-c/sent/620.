How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA 
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do 
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free 
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.
