Hey, I'm getting a mental image here ( of you pawing the ground that is)!!

Backs doing ok right now.  I'm getting a second opinion next Monday.  If the 
second opinion comes in with the same verdict, then I will probably have the 
surgery in April or May.  Jerry said a friend of his told him it took a whole 
month to recover.  I'm thinking a week max then I can go back to work, we 
shall see.  I can't make money if I'm not at work, and my p&l is a big part 
of my evaluation next year.

AND I'm afraid to buy a new truck with the stock market situation.  Who knows 
- I may be out of work sometime soon.
