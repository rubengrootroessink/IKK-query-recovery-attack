I would like to be able to run "Facilitation By Location" with the following 
criteria
1.  I want to pick the counterparty or leave it blank.
2.  I want to enter a date range ==> 02/01/2001 to 02/11/2001
3.  I want to be able to select one or more pipelines without choosing a desk.

Ok, looks like we got some attention.  Please let me know which ones you 
think and I'll consolidate and forward to Felicia.

Katherine,

Could you give me a list of reports you need on a particular pipe regardless 
of desks? 

Thanks,
Felicia

Terry, 

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us 
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe 
regardless of desks.  For example, if I want to see all business that is 
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and 
the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12 
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.  

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into 
one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from 
the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to 
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk 
first when submitting a report.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks!

Kathy
