Chris,

 I am not seeing this deal coming through Unify for ENA (EES shows a 
purchase, but we are not showing a sale).  Could you please check to make 
sure that we agree and that it is in the system?  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.  Thanks...

If this is for a volume of about 10,000 Dth it is a pool-to-pool transfer 
from ENA (we are transferring this gas from Power Gas Marketing's pool).  
When ENA purchased CES's book of business they acquired local production 
behind the citygate.  This is one of those deals.  I did this deal with Chris 
Germany of ENA.  If you need more information please let me know.  Thanks!  md

Hey Marde!

Our system shows we purchased this gas from ENA.  However, ENA does not have 
this in their system.  Could you please give me a little more information on 
the following:

July Business:
Pipeline -  EOGS
Point ID -  P-ECT-1186-001
Rec Meter -  IMBPURCH
Deal Meter -  11264

Thank you so much,
Anate
