Subject: Farewell Happy Hour

Hi Everyone-  

Well, as most of you know, I am moving to Florida on Thursday.   I want to 
have one last happy hour with my Houstonian friends....

Where: The Flying Saucer  (Capital & Main)
When: Tuesday after work until whenever
Why: So that I can say Good Bye 

I'll be there as early as anyone else can go.  Call me if you can go over 
there early with me.  
I hope to see you there,
Alicia
