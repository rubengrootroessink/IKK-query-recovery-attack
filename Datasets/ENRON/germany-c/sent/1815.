Hey  Buddy,
?
I am not for sure  if you remember Leon Simple.? He was the black man which 
worked for Dad at  Dow Track Maint.? Leon lived over by McNeil Bridge on the 
Brazoria side of  the San Bernard.? He has been over to the house in Shady 
Acres  before.? At any rate, he died this past Sunday morning with a massive 
heart  attack.? I sent a Flower Basket on behalf of the Sons Of Wheeler 
Germany,  Don, Jerry and Chris.? 
?
Take  Care,
?
Don
