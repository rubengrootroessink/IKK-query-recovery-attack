Subject: July Volume Request for C&I customers behind COH


Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.
