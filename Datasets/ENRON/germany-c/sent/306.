I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we 
don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify.

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of 
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment 
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verification 
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, 
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal 
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the 
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are 
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for 
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of 
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of 
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this 
contract?

We are noming agent only on Contract 37982 but a Service Verification 
continues to be drafted in Settlements.  How can we stop this from occuring?

Thanks,
Brenda
