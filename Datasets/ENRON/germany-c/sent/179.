Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following 
deal tickets

Deal  Comment
470563  New Power Exchange buy
470568  New Power Exchange sell
470582  CPR Storage Sell
470587  CPR Storage Buy

We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st.  
Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in 
Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.
