Welcome Volunteers!!

Beavy, since you are going to be out, and most of our work will be done next 
week, I will start giving Tricia "to do's" and you can catch up later.

I have a meeting at 3:00 PM today.  I would like to give you both a quick 15 
min preview before then if possible.  Let me know.

Tricia,

Please run a "monthly facilitaion by location" report for "The New Power 
Company" for both MarketEast and East for Jan 2001 and Jan-Dec 2001.  I don't 
know if you can run the Jan-Dec 2001 on one report.  Tricia, if we do the 15 
min meeting today, I would like to have 3 copies of the Jan 2001 facilitation.

I create a ton of bookout deals for New Power  and I always start with the 
CPR report.



Thanks.
