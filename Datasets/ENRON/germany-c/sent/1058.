Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 
day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department 
changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need 
to address right away.

Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.

Thanks.
