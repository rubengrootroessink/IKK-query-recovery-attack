I created deal 546310 for pool sales to New Power.  I currently have a daily 
volume fo 4250 on this deal.  We should be able to move the volumes back and 
forth between this deal and the big citygate deal.

Jeff, I will look at the volumes on our big citygate deal ticket and this one 
pool deal to calculate the Gas Daily pricing.
