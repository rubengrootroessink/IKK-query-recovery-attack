I think you have my NYMX value in backwards.

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This 
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.
