If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA 
or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.  If 
you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge 
on TCO at all.  

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SST 
Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the 
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).


Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it 
has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough.

I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a
stray.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!
