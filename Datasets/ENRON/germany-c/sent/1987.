How does the VNG GSS work?


AND, Jerry and Barbara are coming to Houston tonight.  They want to go to P F 
Changs.  Jerry said they would leave around 6:00 Pm putting them here around 
6:45 to 7:00PM.  Of course you are invited and I told him I would let him 
know where to meet us when they hit the road.

Questions?
