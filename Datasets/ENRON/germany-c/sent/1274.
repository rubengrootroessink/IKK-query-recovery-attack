I have mixed comments on Dodge's.  I think either of the other vehicles are 
perfect.

Hope your injury heals quickly.

I'm thinking about Ford F150, Chevy/GMC or Dodge Dakota.

I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, 
stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with 
me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in 
a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot 
was facing North East.

I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the 
Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".   He popped my foot back in 
place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments 
are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right 
now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.

I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.

What are you looking for in a truck?

Hey, I'm going to have to start car shopping.  I'm really thinking about a 
truck.  Are you interested in helping me look?  I'm asking because I know how 
much you like to look at trucks!  md
