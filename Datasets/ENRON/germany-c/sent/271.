I didn't go to the shipper meeting.  We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy 
that works for us now.  You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back 
when.  He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.

My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.  No new news - I hope to 
find out more next week.

Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!

Tell Muffy I said hi!
