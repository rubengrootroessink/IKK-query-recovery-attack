Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third 
Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did 
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for 
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on 
the worksheet.

So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.
