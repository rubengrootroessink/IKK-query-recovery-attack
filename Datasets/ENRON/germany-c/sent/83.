There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks
chris

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.
