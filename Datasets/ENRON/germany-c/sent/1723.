She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs 
on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to 
take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws 
on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be 
said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are 
kinda tough.  Good luck.

What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she
will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.

Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man?

My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see
I like a cat personality better.

I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a
lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now.

So how is ingrid??

I'm guessing your stomach is nice and cushy.... not rock hard. Your

Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has
a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!

What's up with you girl?

Hope you're doing okay.
