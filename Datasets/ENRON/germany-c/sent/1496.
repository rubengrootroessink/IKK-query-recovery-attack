CNG Transport from NIMO
Contract  5A1866
Term  11/1/99 - 3/31/00
MDQ  15957
Rate Sched FTNN
Demand Dec $5.7690       Jan  $5.7500      Feb 5.7510
Commodity $.0456 (CNG does not bill the commodity part of GRI, also the 
commodity rate does not change during the term of the deal)
Fuel  2.28 %
Note  This should be valued at generic North to North space.

CNG
Marq Demand $6.2500
Volume  15957
Note:  We have no value for this much MARQ.  We might be able to use about 
3,000 dth of this.  I have a call in to Greg Synder at CNG.  Greg is in the 
rates group.  I believe it works like this; we pay max IT for gathering ( 
$.1980 for Jan),  If you have MARQ, the rate drops to $.1440.  IT is a pain 
to nominate.  I will verify that this is the way it works with Greg.
