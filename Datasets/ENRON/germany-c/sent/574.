I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made a 
mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  I 
do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This 
should only be a problem for May and June, I think.

Please pay the disputed amounts.
