Hey Doug, I'm back in the office for awhile.  Let me know if you still have 
questions.

Subject: Invoice Questions


Chris--In addition to my question regarding the AGL-related "transportation
adjustment" charges in the June 15, 2000 invoice for May 2000 (invoice #
11738SA), can you also please check on the 200,000 dth sold to CES at the TENN
Bear Creek storage facility in June?   (SA-236411).   Is this gas related to
one of the so-called pre-pay deals (TEAC, MGAM, MGAG)?  If not, what is it 
for,
because we have not requested that any gas be injected into the Tennessee
storage for this injection season.

Thanks.
