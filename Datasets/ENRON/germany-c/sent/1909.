A friendly reminder.

You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity 
tickets would have to be set up on which business units

Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport 
capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term,
could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly 
basis?    

Russ.
