I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday, 
19th.  It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable.  Sounds good to me.   I 
told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and just 
get my money back for the one I don't use.  I would buy one leaving Monday 
evening and the one for Tuesday morning

COOL, don't you think?

Sorry... I didn't call last night.

I was working on my September spreadsheet for TCO at home. I was going to
take a break and call you and my parents... but I had to get the spreadsheet
done for the long weekend. I finished it at 1:30 am. Thought this would be
too late to call.

Hopefully the weekend scheduling goes smooth, so I can work on August
Accounting this afternoon. I'm just extemely slow at everything right now.

Let's talk this afternoon.
