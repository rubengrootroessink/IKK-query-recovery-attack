Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad
