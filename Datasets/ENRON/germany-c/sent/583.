>  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
>  -----------------------
>
>Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
>to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will provide
>both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and under
>North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
>Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
>Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
>eternal
>flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel
>resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
>boss,
>and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."
>
>  A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
>together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
>both
>companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
>retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
>millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades'
>high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make
>it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
>
>Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
>approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
>growth rates over the last two thousand years.
>
>  Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
>The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
>assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to
>Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
>Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
>by
>customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
>contracts.
