Chris,

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

mhg
