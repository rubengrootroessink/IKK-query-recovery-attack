My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

Subject: Terminating Transco contracts

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.
