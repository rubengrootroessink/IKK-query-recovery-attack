Man what a busy day.  I guess Ingrid is ok.  I have not spoke to her for 
awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think.

I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day, then going to my Dad's 
place this weekend.  What are you doing?

See... Joni knows best.

I bought three pair (black, blue, olive) and have worn them all. That was my
best investment ever.

Are you doing okay??? How is Ingrid???
