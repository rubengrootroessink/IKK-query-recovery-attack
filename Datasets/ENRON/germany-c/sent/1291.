Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's?
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also?
10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?

Call me if you have questions.
