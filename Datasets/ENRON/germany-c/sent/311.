Additional information on the Transco MarketLink shippers:

Shipper   Phase  Volume  Term  Delivery Pt  Rate

Aquila   I     25,000 Dthd 10 years Manhattan  $0.35
Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
St. Lawrence Cement I       1,000  10  Camden, NJ  $0.30
Williams Energy I  100,000  10  Manhattan/PSEG $0.35
Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.
