Subject: MarketLink Shippers

Transco filed service agreements with the FERC for MarketLink (Leidy - Zone 
6) yesterday.  The project will start in two phases.  The shippers and phases 
are as follows:


Phase I (11/1/01 start)

Aquila Energy Marketing    25,000 Dthd
Consolidated Edison     30,000
ConEdison Energy     10,000
St. Lawrence Cement       1,000
Williams Energy Marketing  100,000

Total Phase I    166,000 Dthd

Phase II (11/1/02)

Virginia Power Energy Marketing 100,000 Dthd
PPL Energy Plus     30,000

Total Phase II    130,000 Dthd

Transco says that the remainder of the FERC-approved 700,000 Dthd project 
will be phased in by 11/1/04.
The first phase will start construction in 4/01 and involves looping 30 miles 
of pipe in Pennsylvannia and 30 miles of pipe in New Jersey at a cost of $123 
MM. The second phase will cost $119 MM.  I will let you know the primary 
delivery points of the shipper's capacity when I see the filing.
