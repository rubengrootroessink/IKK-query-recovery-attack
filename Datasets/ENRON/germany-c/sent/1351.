Hey.  It's international  friend week.  I'm sending Natasha an international 
friend email.  I'll send you the email that I send her.  Here is the profile 
I have built for her: 29 yr old, Teaches a children's Sunday School class, 
excellent piano player, believes in recycling, helps little old ladies across 
the street, loves arts and crafts shows, and bakes cookies!  What do you 
think.

What's your wife's name?  I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email.
