Now thats a ture "Pig Farmer" poem if I ever heard one.

I would have sent flowers to my beloved in Ohio if someone would have given 
me her address.

         REDNECK VALENTINE!

    Collards are green,
    my dog's name is Blue
    and I'm so lucky
    to have a sweet thang like you.

    Yore hair is like cornsilk
    a-flappin in the breeze.
    Softer than Blue's
    and without all them fleas.

    You move like the bass,
    which excite me in May.
    You ain't got no scales
    but I luv you anyway.

    Yo're as satisfy'n as okry
    jist a-fry'n in the pan.
    Yo're as fragrant as &quot;snuff&quot;
    right out of the can.

    You have some'a yore teeth
    for which I am proud.
    I hold my head high
    when we're in a crowd.

    On special occasions,
    when you shave under yore arms,
    well, I'm in hawg heaven
    and awed by yore charms.

    Still them fellers at work,
    they all want to know,
    what I did to deserve
    such a purdy, young doe.

    Like a good roll of duct tape
    yo're there fer yore man,
    to patch up life's troubles
    and fix what you can.

    Yo're as cute as a junebug
    a-buzzin' overhead.
 You ain't mean like those far ants
    I found in my bed.
    Cut from the best cloth
    like a plaid flannel shirt,
    you spark up my life
    more than a fresh load of dirt.

    When you hold me real tight
    like a padded gunrack,
    my life is complete.
    Ain't nuttin' I lack.

    Yore complexion, it's perfection,
    like the best vinyl sidin'
    despite all the years,
    yore age, it keeps hidin'.

    Me &quot;n&quot; you's like a moon pie
    with a RC cold drank,
    we go together
    like a skunk goes with stank.

    Some men, they buy chocolate
    for a Valentine's Day,
    they git it at Wal-Mart,
    it's romantic that way.

    Some men git roses
    on that special day
 from the cooler at Krogers,
    that's impressive, I say.

 Some men buy fine diamonds
    from a flea market booth.
    &quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;,
    they explain, suave and couth.

    But for this man, honey,
    these won't do.
    Cause yo're too special,
    you sweet thang you.

    I got you a gift,
    without taste nor odor,
    more useful than diamonds....
    IT'S A NEW TROLL'N MOTOR!!!
