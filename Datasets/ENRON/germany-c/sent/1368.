Chris-

What about Transco Zone 3?

Hey, I'm coming by with a picture of Natasha for you.

It's a huge long-shot, of course, a shot in the dark, but, hey- what the 
hell. The hardest thing about meeting her would be her getting a visa to come 
here. They're almost unavailable except for family members of US citizens. 
And, you'd be uncomfortable travelling there without an "escort," so to 
speak, because you don't speak Russian.
