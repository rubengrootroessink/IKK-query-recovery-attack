Angie, would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to 
Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551.  
Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction.

Chris,

 I just finished talking with you about a deal that we sold to Clinton Energy 
Management (Deal #320094).  The volume that we have in our system has a 
volume of  13,330 MMBtu and it should be 13,551 MMBtu @ 4.56 (We only need to 
change the volume).  Could you please change this as soon as possible so that 
I can get a corrected invoice to them?  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks...
