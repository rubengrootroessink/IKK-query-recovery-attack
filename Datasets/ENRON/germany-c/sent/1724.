U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just 
kicked in somehow.

Ya'll reckon the old Coot had all this planned so if there was any problem 
form
marriage, family etc, this automatically happened.   He probably did this back
when he was swapping land with Bertha and did not plan on us having to do this
again in the future.  MMMM, interesting.   Hey did he leave any of the land to
me or just you guys???

Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
either.

I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.

I just spoke with "Wendy" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

Love you MAN!!
