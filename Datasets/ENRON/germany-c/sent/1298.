Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me 
know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.


Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I 
welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract 
and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing 
scenarios."

Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to 
discuss the status of the January 2000 invoice billing (sales & purchase). 
There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up  in Unify. 
Customer is paying Enron $28 million on Monday and we only have $11 million 
in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for 
$16,972,671.72 and a system generated invoice of $11,477,340.49 on Friday 
February 18th.

Send me an e-mail back to confirm.

Thanks, Jeff
