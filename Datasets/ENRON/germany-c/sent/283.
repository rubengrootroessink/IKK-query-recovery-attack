I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better
winter riding gear.

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing
is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should
only take about five minutes.

That's all I have for now.
