I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well 
(other than the price).  I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the 
deal.  You have not sold it to anyone have you?  If not, I'm going to try to 
sell it to EES for the term.  And if I remember correctly, the volume is 
10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?
