Here it is, similar to Dec00. CPA only gave us 1dth primary to 8-36 and Jan 
demand is 2dth. I have a call in to CPA, go ahead and nom 2 on K#66940. Chris 
was checking on your side. Have additional 1,285 bought from EES at A06 for 
COH. I will send latest guess for COH Jan 1 later, real forcast 12/31 AM. 
Producer thinks you are swinging on it for Dec?
