As you are painfully aware, starting October 1 several of the CES / New Power 
utilities will be going to daily requirements.  Therefore, for those of you 
that handle the upstream scheduling for city gate deliveries to New Power 
please provide us with the pipelines you schedule, your pager number and that 
of your designated back-up, if applicable.  Additionally, anytime you know 
that you'll be unavailable please advise us who to contact in your absence.

Our plan is to send e-mails each weekday morning directly to schedulers that 
have changes ... and then follow up with a Daily Requirements summary (which 
several of you have indicated you do not need to see a copy of).  If you 
would prefer a phone call instead of or in addition to the e-mail on mornings 
that we have changes on your pipelines, please advise.  Please notify us via 
e-mail anytime you have a contract change that affects us (during the week) 
and page us on the weekends.

Thanks for your help.
