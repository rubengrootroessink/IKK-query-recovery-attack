Here it is:  Your distinct personality, The Merchant, might be found in most
of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Your overriding goal is to always be
competitive, for Merchants are the deal makers. Every situation is
realistically analyzed for its profit potential. A well executed deal, even
one that is profitable for all participants, can be its own reward for many
Merchants. On the positive side you can be logically practical, rational and
realistic. On the negative side you may be rigidly dogmatic as well as
unmerciful and precipitous. Interestingly, your preference is just as
applicable in today's corporate kingdomsY
