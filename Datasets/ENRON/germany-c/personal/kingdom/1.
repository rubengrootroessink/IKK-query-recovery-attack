It looks like we now have all the descriptions including the Black Knight, so attached below you will find the updated list.  As it turns out, the only career that we had no one fall into is the Doctor.  The career where we had the most people fall into is the White Knight.  So, either we have a lot of good people or a lot of people who like to think of themselves as good.  Which is good, since we have no doctor for our kingdom.
