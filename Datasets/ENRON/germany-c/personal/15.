Bad news about Robin.  I hope she starts feeling better. This getting older
stuff is for the birds!!

I hope everything goes well with the birth.  You'll be pleased with a boy or
a girl, I'm sure.  Audrey and Christopher are both very nice names.  By the
way, my sister was a Judy, not Judith--my dad was responsible for that one.

Have you called Scott H. about the CMS job?  He might be a good match.  When
I last emailed with him, he said he was going to take some time off once he
was done at EnergyUSA.

As for working estate team, I don't think I could go back now.  Who knows
what horrible things I might say to Scott Neal??  He lied to me and was so
incredibly spineless when he told me I "wasn't part of the team" back in
December that I don't think I could stomach interacting with him on any
level.. You're on a different floor from them, right?  You probably still
see some of the UBS people though.  How is Judy?  I haven't heard from her
in a long time.  I emailed her a funny joke a while back but never heard
anything else from her.

Well, gotta go.  Take care and say hello to Ingrid for me.

Susan
