Chris,
 
        Thanks again for taking a few moments  to speak with me.  We appreciate you letting us help you out in preparing  for your impending "life after Enron."
 
        Please don't be overwhelmed by the  detail we ask for in the forms.  The reason we ask for such detail is that  this information, along with your resume and any verbal help you can offer, is  what we will use in preparing a marketing presentation for whichever suitors you  choose.  We take this information, work with you to promote your most  attractive professional assets, and hope to create a bidding war for your  services.
 
    With the quality of people that are in the market right  now (most of whom you know and/or used to work with), we are finding that some  companies will even make an opening for the right person with the right track  record.  Your ability to create $1.6 million last year, while working under  Enron's credit issues, will speak highly of you.  I am sure that  we will find you a new position when you are ready.  At MRI,  we are growing our credibility and increasing our options with every placement;  be sure to thank the guys you know that we have placed when we get you a better  position than what they have!
 
    In addition to this information, we also need you to put  together a list of companies (as many as you can think of) that you would like  to work for and a list of 12 references.  I'm sure Al told you most of  that, but I just wanted make sure.  Don't put yourself under too much  pressure to get that stuff done completely; we'll work through whatever you want  clarified over the phone.
 
    If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate  to call me at 713/627-0880.  You can also e-mail me at jeffk@schouston.com . Thanks again for  letting us help you out.
 
Sincerely,
Jeff Keene
