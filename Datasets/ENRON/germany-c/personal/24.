Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

xoxo
