Chris,

Delete them.  We can do it on this end.

Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two
lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.
Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do
you think?

		*	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
		*	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition
deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to
talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Thanks
