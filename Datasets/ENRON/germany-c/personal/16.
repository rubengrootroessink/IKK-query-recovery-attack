Hi, Chris!  It's good to hear from you.

Thanks for thinking about me.  I saw CMS's ad in Sunday's paper for that
position.  I sent my resume to them in response to an ad back in December,
and their HR folks called me in early January about an interview.  Then the
situation must have changed because then the HR lady acted like they didn't
really have a position to fill after all.  I've discovered that most HR
people are really lame (that's the nicest thing I can say!).  I'll call Curt
Lizzi; however, I think you're more qualified to trade NE physical than I
am.  I'm probably better suited for Gulf Coast.

I've been talking with Reliant and they may have a Gulf Coast position
available soon.  I'm not thrilled about some of the people there, but who
knows?  Duke may have a Gulf Coast position available because someone
recently quit; however, Renato works there now so I'm SOL.  I had a good
interview with them in late January when they didn't have the spot.  Since
then, Renato has started with them in their origination group.  Timing is
everything!!  Guess who Renato's working for?  Eric Gonzales, formerly of
Enron fame and fortune.  He's Dan's old buddy.

Robin might be interested in the CMS job.  Is she still working estate team
at Enron/UBS??  I haven't spoken with her since December.  I've had very
little contact with anyone there.  My last emails went unanswered, so I
decided to give up.

Good luck with your baby!  When is the due date?  I know you are both
excited.  It will be a real change in lifestyle but not a negative one,
believe me.

Take care,

Susan

Susan,

I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well
for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may
be a non event.

CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter
set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi,
Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see
me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking
for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said
he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never
know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with
a pregnant girlfriend.

later
chris
