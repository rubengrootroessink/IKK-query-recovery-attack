To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve 
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ. 
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my 
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a 
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been 
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has 
already been approved by Don Belcher at TCO.

Julie/Steve, please pass this note to Mike.... I don't have his e-mail 
address.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: CGAS Storage

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.
