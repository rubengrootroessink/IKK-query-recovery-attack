Hello all:

We will be out of the office June 5 through June 8.  On the mornings of
the 5th and the 8th we will be airborne during the usual IT trading
time.  As such, we would like to sell for Tuesday's gas day on Friday,
June 2 (much like this past Memorial Day Weekend) and for Friday's gas
day on Wednesday, June 7.

Fri June 2 - sell for Sat June 3 through Tues June 6 gas days
Tues June 6 - sell for Wed June 7 gas day
Wed June 7 - sell for Thurs June 8 and Fri June 9 gas day
Fri June 9 - back in the office, sell for Sat June 10 - Mon June 12 gas
days, business as usual

While we are away you can beep us at 860-260-6741.  If you call
203-944-7006 and leave a message, please make it a DETAILED one, because
the voicemail automatically beeps us at the above number, and we call in
to listen to the messages.  Please don't leave a message and then beep
us anyway, you will just be delaying our response to you.  You can also
try us directly at the hotel - 602-955-6600.

Please call either of us at the numbers below if you have any questions.

Robin & Maria
