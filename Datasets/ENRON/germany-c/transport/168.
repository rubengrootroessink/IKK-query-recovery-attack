Answers to your quetions:
Yes; no; maybe

Just kidding....
Interconnects for Calp and Dayton handled the same...just add those meters to 
the sell tkts to CES and the buys are the delivery points.  Don't path the 
actual contract in Unify...When we hold that capacity and EDI, we'll path in 
Unify.... We don't get the bills from TCO  in January for that contract.  Get 
em in February (when we hold the capacity).  They are set up in Unify but we 
won't actually use....We are providing that service for those guys.

Try  your best for trueing up the transport tkts and the CALP and Dayton tkts 
in Sitara.  Impact is on P and L for the desk daily and later on for the 
(O/A) operational analysis where the accountants compare what we estimated 
our costs and revenues for the desk were and what they actually came in 
at.......We know January will be messy...

Go ahead and true up the PAL agreement to match physical flow......

BUY/SELLS with ENA and CES.  We talked at the beginning of the month about 
this.  Sales/buys  to/from ENA on the CES reports and sales/buys to/from CES 
on the ENA facilitation by location reports should just be pahted as 
buy/sells.  (hopefully should be done already......)

I have a meeting from 3-4 today...other than that I'll be downstairs with 
y'all to answer any questions....

THANKS!!!!

You were a busy little bee last night!!!! Thanks for the help.

FSS 63304 - we are not using. I'll ask John Hodge what this storage had been 
used for in the past.

Clarification needed for the Dayton and Calp sell at the pool. How is the 
interconnect gas supply done... we had some on Calp with Virginia Power and 
Coral. In the past we have some on Dayton... don't think we have any in 
January yet. Does this through another monkey wrench into the works?

We will probably have to run some report out of navigator to true-up 
transport tickets. There are a ton of cuts lately and Joann receives daily 
request from CES retail for volume changes. Not sure the best, efficient way 
to maintain these tickets daily.

PAL for CES was physically flowed on January 1. Should we change the tickets 
to match physical flow???

I'm bummed about the storage ticket change again... but will redo the paths. 
This will be a couple hours of rework for me... not sure about Joann.

You have lost me on the ENA to CES and CES to ENA buy sell tickets. Can't 
think of any examples yet. Hope this doesn't cause repathing.

Subject: Dayton Stuff & Calp & other fun stuff

Hello my favorite TCO people:  Here's what we here at team TCO have done so 
far....Let's recap shall we..........

Dayton and Calp get the invoices from the p/l and we re-imburse them for the 
transport differenentials so......

Dayton capacity buy at the citygate = Sitara #151878 - path as buy/sell with 
your markets.
Dayton capacity sell at the pool = Sitara #151877 - path as buy sell from 
pool.  These 2 tkts  should be released  by Stephanie tomorrow morning.  True 
these up as best you can daily.
  
Also:
Calp capacity buy at the citygate = Sitara #149776 - path as buy/sell wth 
your markets.
Calp capacity sell at the pool = Sitara #149775 - path as buy/sell at pool.  
These 2 tkts should be released by Stephanie tomorrow morning.  True these up 
as best you can daily.

Our transport tkts from pool to city gate for all other transport still 
remains Sitara# 95448 and Sitara# 95449.   Please true up as best you can.

NEXT:
Do ya'll have 2 FSS Storages Contracts # 51407 and 63304?  

Deal # 151879 covers storage K# 63304 and deal # 151880 covers storage K# 
51407.  The Sitara gods have to approve, bounce the server and then it will 
appear in Unify for you to path....  

Deal # 149778 is the storage w/d ticket for both K# 63304 and K#51407.   Deal 
# 151882 is the storage injection ticket for the same.  The counterparty had 
to be changed back to CPR storage.  You guys have to unpath and re-path that 
piece showing the purchase from CES for the storage w/d.  Really SORRY about 
this!!!  Counterparty could not be CES --- We can't path on stg. contract and 
out of inventory and buy from CES at the same time w/o the point not being 
balanced. 

Park and Lend contract #64031 and # 64041 are being set up by Chris in Sitara 
but we have to get the Sitara gods to set up PAL contracts as ENA agency 
deals for CES so he can't put the deals in the system just yet.  They should 
be available tomorrow hopefully!!!!  They are for 250,000 on the first and 
the 300,000 on the second of January.  Path them accordingly depending on 
where that PAL gas went.

In addition all deals that are ENA to CES or CES to ENA should be pathed as 
buy/sells.

I think that is it for now.  Let me know if anything else stops you from 
pathing, running tracking and balancing and finally from bridging back the 
first  to Sitara. Let's set a GOAL to have the first totally pathed and 
tracked and balanced and bridged back and clean by close of business the 
19th. YEAH BABY!!!! 

By the way, we really appreciate the monumental effort you three have made in 
meeting all logistical requirements of the old and new TCO business and 
keeping track of the volumes in Sitara, Unify and Navigator...We're are 
zeroing in on end of month balance tie outs between Navigator and Sitara for 
the 4 CES pools and the 2 ENA pools.  We've kept a bunch of balls in the air 
for the last 4 weeks and to my knowledge haven't dropped one darn ball yet.   
Thanks.........
