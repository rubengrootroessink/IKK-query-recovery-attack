Hi Scott,

I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia
customers.  I'll call you as soon as I complete my nominations for the
weekend.

I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG -
I'll see if I can't resolve that...

Thanks,
David Familetto
