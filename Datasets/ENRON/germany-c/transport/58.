Attached are two documents containing the regulatory summaries for this 
period.  The first is the same document you are used to seeing--a summary of 
all types of filings made by the pipelines to FERC.  The second is a special 
document that contains only the Order 637 compliance filings that have been 
made.  As I'm sure most of you are aware, each pipeline must make a filing 
indicating how it intends to comply with the new Order 637 regulations.  For 
your convenience I have included in the second attachment an explanation of 
the new Order 637 requirements, followed by the compliance filings that I 
have received to date.   I will update this document as new filings are 
received.  If you have any questions, I may be reached at x35514.
