I have spoken with Rick Ward at CES about this.  We will provide CES with 
copies of any invoices that have pre 1/2000 charges on them.  We will 
pay/take the credit after CES has agreed to the adjustments.  We will then 
bill/pay CES monthly for these adjustments.  If this is inconsistent with any 
agreements between CES and ENA, please let me know.  Otherwise, we will 
continue down this path.  Thanks.

Subject: CES Transportation Expense

The January invoice from CNG Transmission for CES Transportation Contracts 
includes charges for production months prior to January, 2000.  In total,  
the prior month charges amount to $ 23,868.92.  Per Chris, ENA will pay 
this.  Do you agree?

Thanks,
Brenda
