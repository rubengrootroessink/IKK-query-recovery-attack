Hello Everyone-

Attached is an updated version of the expiring transportation contracts by 
Pipeline and by Expiration Date.

I f you have any questions about this worksheet please give me a call.  I 
have sorted it three different ways for you, but the base data is the same in 
all three versions.

Thanks,

Julie  :-)
