Looks like ya'll figured this out... Joann please monitor STOI while I'm out. 
The folder is on my desk with rachets. The MDIQ for storage in May is 
48,405.  Please continue to get approval above this amount from TCO Gas 
Control. Also, please keep the spreadsheet updated while I'm out... please 
input May 3rd's entry... I'm sure this has already been done.
