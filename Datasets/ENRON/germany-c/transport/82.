Subject: Iroquios - Model Type Change Needed  

In order to prepare for EDI, I have reviewed the February invoice from 
Iroquios and determined that this contract (125099) is indeed billed as the 
pipeline stated - a non-pathed service.

Sylvia, please modify similar to National fuels by creating a new service 
type - "Park and Loan - Non Pathed" to be effective 6-1-00.  Are there any 
others? Please notify the above when done.

Chris, will you set up a new deal ticket on this new service in Sitara when 
available and notify Angie?  Terminate the old deal ticket effective 5-31-00

Angie, it  appears you are already pathing this contract correctly, it will 
be necessary to select the correct service from the service list for June 1st 
nominations.  There are some other contracts that I believe we need to change 
the pathing methodology on in the near future.

thx
RP

Will this contract be able to be added as non-pathed for edi, or do I have to 
hardcode?

Richard,

Could you look at the invoice and verify that the park & loan service is 
really non-pathed for Iroquis contract 125099.

Unify has contract 125099 as pathed.  The pipe says they are non-pathed on 
this service.

If this needs to be changed, could you get Global to add this, and let the 
Scheduler know about the nom basis/model type addition.  The Scheduler's are 
Molly LaFuze and Victor LaMadrid.

Thanks, Diane
