For spot delivered or transported deals, as tickets keep getting bigger with 
more and more meters and more and more days on them, they take  longer and 
longer to save (release).  For now, Chris keep doing what you 're doing.  As 
Chris creates deals (buy /sells/ or spot sales), he'll send  e-mails with 
quick descriptions for CES Retail notification and enter them into Sitara as 
buy/sells.  THanks Chris and thanks TCO team

I wonder if we could chat about deal tickets this afternoon.  Hopefully this 
meeting will only last 5-10 minites.
