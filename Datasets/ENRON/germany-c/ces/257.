Joann,
Apparently the way our contract works, if we have the primary capacity
available I can request gas from you and it will be priced at GDA Columbia
App.  Otherwise we have to price it through Brian/Chris.  Could you please let
me know if we are able to serve these volumes using old CES contracts:

Mkt 5-2  9615 dth total

Mkt 7-1  7600 dth total

Mkt 7-8  321 dth total

Thanks Joann!
