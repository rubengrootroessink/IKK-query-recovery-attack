Subject: Allocation of June Deal at COH


Joann,

Here is the distribution of the CES EU deal that Chris did with Charlie last
week.  The original deal volume was
for 263,580 dth/month. Doug could you please ask Chris if he will keep us 
whole
on the contracted price for
the extra 20,000 dth?

Joann pls call me if you have trouble reading this.  Please note that the
volumes to 8-35 are for TIMET only (k64939).

Thanks,
Kara
