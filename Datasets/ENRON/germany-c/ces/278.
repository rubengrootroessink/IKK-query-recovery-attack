Subject: CGAS meeting

I will be entering individual deals for CES until we come up with a better 
method.  What if I set up a meeting with all of you, Dick Jenkins, Scott 
Hendrickson, Sarah Mullholland and myself Thursday afternoon to discuss deal 
tickets and pricing?

Good - bad?

Let me know.  Also, I will be out of the office tomorrow.
