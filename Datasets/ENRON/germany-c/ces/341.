I created these deal tickets to account for the term sells as follows:

145328         Allied Signal for 3405/day from TCO pool
149785         International Paper (Union Camp) for 7158/day from TCO pool

The counterparty names says CES-Columbia-Retail, because there was no
CES-Allied Signal nor CES-International Paper. Not sure if this matters for
Enron's system. Also, the pricing and ending term date needs to be
verified.

Thanks.
