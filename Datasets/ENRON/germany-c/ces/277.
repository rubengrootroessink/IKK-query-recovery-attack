Is this note to Brian below incremental gas????????

Meaning... Joann has a number about 250,000/day given to her by the LDC 
Schedulers. This includes daily volume:

Who    Volume  Sitara Deal Ticket
CES Endusers    93689  143336
Choice    107489  148416 
South Jersey   36900  142776
Penn Fuel   5000  151759
Hopewell   4500  139679
Texaco    255  136502
Engage   1966  142656
Florida Power and Light  152  151788

Total    249,951

Is there a way to put all incremental gas on one deal ticket??? It would make 
our pathing life a lot easier too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I believe you did a fixed priced deal with Craig Taylor.  The price is 
$3.06.  Could you get me the meter numbers?  This is what I have so far
