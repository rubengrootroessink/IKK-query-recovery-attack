Subject: CES Transco invoice

We received a prior period adjustment (December activity) on the 
JanuaryTransco invoices for CES.  Its a credit of $6,432.31.  Its releated to 
the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.  This credit should be 
passed through to CES.  How is that being handled?
