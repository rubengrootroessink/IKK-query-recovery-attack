Donna,

Please let me know if you hear of any capacity available for Feb-00 on Tenn
Z6.  If possible, we want to try to buy capacity or delivered gas past our
furthest delivery point on Tenn so you can back-haul your needs.

Brian

Just got off of the phone with Enron.   Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a  reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.   Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.   I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

Here is the file
