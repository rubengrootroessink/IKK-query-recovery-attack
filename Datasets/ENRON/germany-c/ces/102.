Per the note below; this is 13,396/day x 11 days = 147,356. Some of the gas 
is connected to Interconnect Gas. In the past we have kept the Interconnect 
Gas whole by taking it to STOI. We will need some guidance on this tomorrow. 

Joann, let me know if you need help with the nom's... since there will be a 
lot of them to change around.
