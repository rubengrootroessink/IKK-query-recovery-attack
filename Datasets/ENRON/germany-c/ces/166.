I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the 
pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775

Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 
217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that.

Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.
