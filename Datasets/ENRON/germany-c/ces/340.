The restrictions at BGE will continue today the 19th.  The posting said it
might last until Friday.  Like yesterday, Fred will be determining how much
extra needs to be bought and delivered intraday.  I will work with Enron to 
buy
the gas and get the contract number in order to nom the supply and the 
customer
allocations.  If the customer burns more than 3% over what we have allocated 
to
them, they will be buying gas at the $12.00 Production Rate.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you,
Kara
