Chrissy,  This is Cove Point gas we use to cover CES retail sales on TCO.  
The price was not entered in the separate meter entry for COVE POINT for that 
deal #143336.  So I entered the CGAS APPAL.IF.MI + 0.0841 price to cover 
those sales to CES. FYI.. It's the same price we have for all the other 
retail sales to CES on TCO on that ticket.   If it is different then change 
it.  THANKS

Hey Buddy, get Scott Hendrickson to pull this up.  If it's Cove Point gas, 
then Scott, Robin, and Kate will need to figure it out.

My Sitara is still not working.

Chris,

Just wanted to verify a portion of sitara # 143336 (Sale to Columbia Energy 
Services Corp.).

At the point, "Loudoun - CGAS/CVPT Loudoun", volumes are coming through Unify 
@ $0 and Econ is flashing volumes @ $ .0001. I just wanted to make certain 
that the economics  pricing is correct since all other parts of the deal are 
at  an Index + .0841.

Please call or e-mail your response. 

Thanks for your help.
