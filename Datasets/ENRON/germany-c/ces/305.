Doesn't seem to be a problem allocating the gas.  But please make sure Chris
Germany knows that these two pieces he bought from First Energy are in MCF b/c
they are local production.

Okay, please tell me which contracts are local production?  Just the pieces I
didn't get a contract for?
The 5-2 Agg Pool Nom ID is 2540.  The 5-7 Agg Pool Nom ID is 3983.
thanks

I need a specfic nomination group to be identified for the local production.
The local production can not be given to any choice nomination group. This gas
must be local production and not gas from East Ohio.

Please let me know the contract numbers for the "COH Production" gas and path
them in Gain if you don't mind.  Please also verify that this gas is showing

Thanks for your help!
