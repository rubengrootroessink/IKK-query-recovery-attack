DPL has issued a revised OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I 
will
need to adjust my volumes as follows:

23rd - cut volume of 883 to 723 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

24th - cut volume of 823 to 622 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

25th - cut volume of 1203 to 662 dth on TGT k#6057

Effective the 26th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day.

DPL may revise the 24th and 25th tomorrow.   I will update you tomorrow.
Thanks for your help.   (Kim is out today so you will need to contact me with
any questions).
