Hi Ernie.  You probably did not know I am in another group now.  It is even
a different Enron company.  I forwarded your note to Joann Collins.  She
does TCO and can download those files and send them to you.  The
spreadsheet was done by Chris Germany this month.  If you need to talk to
Joann, her number is 853-5610 and her e-mail is joann.collins@enron .com.

I sure enjoyed working with you Ernie!

Molly

Please send me your August file.

Thanks,
