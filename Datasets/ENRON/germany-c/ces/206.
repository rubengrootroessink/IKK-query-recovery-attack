I talked with Chris G a little while ago---Two important items to note:

* He will be working on the rest of the CES business on Saturday and should 
be ready for us to bill out on Monday.

* On the manual invoice that was sent this past week.... CGAS was actually 
netted (the net of Sales and Purchase for this pipe only) so we need to find 
out what the real sales and purchase prices are when it's time to fix it in 
Unify (Chris, this one's a heads up for you when we see you for clean ups).

Ok....c'est tout.
