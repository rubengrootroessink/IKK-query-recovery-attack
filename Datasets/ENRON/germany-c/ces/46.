For the Ohio gas, we should be pulling any additional volume out of our Bank
and we will bill first of month, any thing we dont burn should be put into our
bank, MME will have to buy the bank at the end of the month anyway.

For the other Major account areas unless it is a major adjustment, I was
assuming gas daily plus transport + premium
