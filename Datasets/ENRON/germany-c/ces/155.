Chris - did you ask Kate who helped with the Bug deal.  Even if they are not 
the ones for CES, at least they could be at the meeting and help us iron out 
the issues we will face here.  Please let me know.

Also, a side note:  we received the proxy schedule from Melissa, but I'm 
curious if you all have discussed the ending balance for March.  Out of 
curiousity, are they withdrawing right now?  Are they near their required 
minimums or well below?   We need to verify all of this so that we know what 
we're working with when we start doing storage for our own account and use.

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?
