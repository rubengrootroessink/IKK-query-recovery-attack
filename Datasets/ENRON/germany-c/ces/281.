Subject: Working Session on February 10, 2000

Southern is hosting a meeting for AGL and the certificated marketers on
February 10, 2000 from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CCT at our offices in
Birmingham, AL.  This meeting is designed to provide a working session for
all attendees to reach agreement on the mechanics of allocating deliveries
when no-notice service is acquired by the marketers.  We encourage everyone
to participate and limit the number of attendees to two people per company
to keep the size manageable.  Please contact Lisa Guthrie at (205) 325-3816
if you need more people from your organization to attend.

Attached is an invitation and RSVP to be completed and returned by Noon on
Monday, February 7, 2000.  You can reply by email to Peggy Jones at
jonesp2@epenergy.com or by fax at (205) 326-2038.

The Tutwiler Hotel is a 2 block walk from our offices, and currently has
availability.  To make a reservation for the night of February 9, 2000,
please call (205) 322-2100, and tell them you are with Sonat to receive the
$89 per night rate (while availability lasts).

If you have any questions regarding the meeting , please contact me or your
account manager.
