Hi Joanie.  Per our discussion on Friday, April 7, please execute the 
following
changes to be effective Tuesday, April 11.


Please deliver 359 Dth from CGT Mainline to Aristech's SIT account number
41026.  Their SIT imbalance is 341 Dth.  This occured on April 4.

  359 x .9718 Mainline shrink =349 Dth at TCO
  349 x .97816 TCO shrink =341 Dth at SIT accounting point.

Also, please don't forget the 85 Dth from March that we need to deliver to
these guys in April.  Thanks.
