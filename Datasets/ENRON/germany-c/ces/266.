Sent a retro request to TCO last week with two options:

1) Inject into storage from CES IPP pool, which was long that day.
2) In ground storage transfer from Dayton's FSS storage to CES's FSS storage. 
Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.

I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should 
not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers. 

As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will 
probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the 
penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that 
incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly. I did tell TCO to 
remember that Enron is not an affiliate, and TCO needs to treat Enron as TCO 
would its other shippers.

Responding to your question below, yes we do need the enduser gas.  Please let
me know the final outcome on this.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas?

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject:  TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted
amount (+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was
over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage
over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the
weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the
storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please
tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is
still feeling generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try
to cause unnecessary pain.
