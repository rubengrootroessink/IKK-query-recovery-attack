To all:

Attached are contract briefs of the referenced contracts.  I need your help with identifying other "Risks/Issues" and "Potential Bidders".

We can discuss in our meeting later this morning.  However, even if we don't get together later this morning I need to get the complete review to Ed soon, so please get back to me by lunch.

Thanks in advance for your help!



Eric
