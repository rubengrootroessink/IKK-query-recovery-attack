The taxing agency does not have contract numbers etc. The taxpayer is 
required to file a tax rendition (return) with the taxing authority annually 
by April 1st.  From the information provided on the rendition, the taxing 
agency will generate a taxable value.  In the case of tax year 2000, the 
taxing jurisdiction probably set an arbitrary value based on prior year's 
values.  The value for tax year 2000 could be higher or lower but at this 
time it is too late to protest.
