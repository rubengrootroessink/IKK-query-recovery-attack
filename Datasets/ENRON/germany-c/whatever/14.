I show the following 12 "fixed price" deals between ENA and CES that were 
assigned to New Power.  Negative dollar amounts based on the volumes of the 
1st 3 shown below were on the August invoice ... which I interpreted to be 
where ENA was buying the gas back at Index.  I assumed all 12 deals should be 
similarly represented on the invoice.

I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.  Could you email 
me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August?
