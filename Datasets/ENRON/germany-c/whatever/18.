Subject: Storage true up

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage
true up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should
probably be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the
Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
