I know you all get sick and tired of people asking you for fund-raising 
money, so I promise this will be the only time for me.  (Hopefully it's less 
intrusive for you if I ask by e-mail instead of person to person)

 My son's school is participating in the Texas Marathon, which is a 
fundraiser held at private schools across the state, where 100% of the 
proceeds go directly to the schools.   This year is an especially important 
one for our school because our building needs a new roof---$50,000!   Anyway, 
the kids have to solicit sponsors and they have a special Texas Marathon day 
at school where they walk, together with parents, pets, brothers, sisters and 
teachers, to benefit their schools.  I would really appreciate if you could 
donate to the cause.  With the Enron matching program, it really makes a 
difference!  His school is very small, they keep the tuition low, and they 
teach the old-fashioned way, including Christian values.  I really want to 
support the school and keep it going.  

If you can give anything, please let me know via e-mail and I'll come by and 
collect the check, or you can just drop it by my desk.  The checks should be 
made payable to Carden-Jackson School.  I need to finish the collections by 
October 17 so I can get the matching forms into Enron

Thanks for your help!



 Colleen
