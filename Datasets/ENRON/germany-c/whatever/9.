HAH!  You know I can't tell you!  But your close.
 That's all I'm saying!  And, I'm a small.  (I'd like a fancy Enron shirt.)

You look really nice today.  I like that outfit you are wearing.  How full
is storage??  74%??  79%??  When are we going to lunch?  What size shirt do
you wear?

   Where have you been?  Maybe listening to a presentation from Lay about
   the future of Enron?

   Storage looks pretty full.  We didn't have a net withdrawal last week.

      Happy Monday all, did you miss me Friday?  I haven't heard much
   feedback
      about our new website.  Please let me know if any of you have any
      suggestions, or questions about it.

      We have 20,000 dth available for ISS, South of Concord, North of
   Concord
      and on the West Side.  This space is available for IAS payback as
   well.

      There is not much spread between Niagara and Leidy so I have
   20,000dth
      available through Concord.  I like to think that means our system is
      extremely efficient!  Must be the good information I send out that
      improves the efficiency, right!?

      I also have 60,000dth available for excess withdrawal of IAS
      opportunity. Or for your use if Chantal spins out of control and hits
      your supplier's.
