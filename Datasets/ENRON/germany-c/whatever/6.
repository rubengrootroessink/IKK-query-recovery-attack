Chris,

Just so I'm clear....you want to change this deal from Waddington to CNG/North, is that correct?  If that is, this deal is not booked anywhere in TAGG for the term at waddington.  It is all booked at the customer price of Tetco/M3.  If you are actually changing the physical location, the p&l changes will only be seen on a monthly basis, not for the forward positions.


I will come over after trading to talk to you.


Thanks,

Kam
