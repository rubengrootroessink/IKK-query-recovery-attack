******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract 
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November 
20th about the overrun situation above.  The VNG gas control experienced  the 
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first 
priority.  This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating 
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum  volumes from   storage 
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery 
points.  Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the  
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day 
with no-notice contracts.  Ranking has zero effect with the late night   
schedulers.

5) Enron dropped the Hopewell nomination from the VNG contract(s) effective 
11/22.

Subject: Columbia Gas Transmission (TCO) penalties - November 2000


** High Priority **

I received a call this afternoon from the VNG - TCO Account Manager.  VNG 
incurred pipeline overrun charges from  Nov 17th - 21st.  TCO stated ENA used 
VNG capacity to deliver to other markets {Hopewell Power Plant}.  TCO 
notified Enron and VNG of the allocation problem during the month of 
November, 2000.  Although TCO assured Enron that the predetermined allocation 
methodology would be corrected to allow VNG rights to pull under the contract 
first, however, based on the conversation with TCO, corrections were not 
made.  Therefore, VNG incurred overrun charges under the VNG contract @ 
$10.00/dth totaling $560,000+.

Please notify pipeline to reconcile and provide AGLES with pipeline invoices 
for November, 2000.  ENA is responsible for all penalties associated with 
this transaction.
