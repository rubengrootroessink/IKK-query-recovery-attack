Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.
