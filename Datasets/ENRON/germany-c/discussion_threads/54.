Chris,

What's going on?  I just got back from a much needed spring break -- I spent
a few days in Cancun -- what a place!  Nashville's been treating me pretty
well.  I've been seeing this one girl up here for a while.  She's really
nice, but I'm sure that it's only going to be a short-term thing.  How about
you?  Are you still seeing Ingrid?

Have you been going out much with Jim and Merideth?  Well, hopefully you're
still keeping up with the singles scene, because I'm going to be spending
the summer in Houston, and I'll need a drinking partner -- preferrably
somebody who's as much of a light-weight as I am.

Let me know how everything is going.  I should start work the 21st of May,
and I'll give you a call when I get into town.

Talk to you later,

Chad
