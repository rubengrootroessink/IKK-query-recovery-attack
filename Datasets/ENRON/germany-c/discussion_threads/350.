I talked to John Hodge this morning and here is the scoop.

51407 is the master agreement for CES for Storage withdrawals and injections. 
This master agreement is contract number used for scheduling. This contract 
tracks the withdrawal and injections charges.

Any FSS storage deal that is done will appear on a separate contract number. 
Only the accountants will see this contract number. For billing purposes, it 
will track the demand and capacity charges. This is the case for 63304, which 
is the CES Retail Storage deal. We never use this contract for scheduling. 
Don't think Victor created a separate Sitara deal ticket, so should be okay 
in Sitara.

This concept is similar to Transco, where you have one nominating contract 
for your transport and there are individual contracts for billing purposes.

Hopefully I said this correct... we can ask John Hodge for better 
clarification if needed. His number at enron is X37276.

Thanks.
