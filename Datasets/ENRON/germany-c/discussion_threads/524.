Sylvia - I have received the invoices for the direct meters for 01/00 for CNG
for CES and CEM, but the contracts are not in path manager and I can't pull
them up in Global contracts.  Can you take care of this?  Let me know if I
need to send this to someone else, also, let me know if you need anything
from me.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118
