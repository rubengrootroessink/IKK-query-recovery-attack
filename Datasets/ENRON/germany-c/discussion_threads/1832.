A quick summary of the Dominion Transmission Pool Operators Meeting:

1.  Two Pooling/Aggregations points:
  Appalachian Northpointe( Finnefrock & Misc) 
  Appalachian Southpointe (Bridgeport, Cornwell, Hastings & Misc)
2.  Two pool types:
   Transmission pool when the gas is delivered into a transmission line;
   Gathering pool when gas is delivered into gathering line.
3.  Pool operatores can do pool-to-pool tranfers between Transmission pools 
or between Gathering pools.  NO pool-to-pool transfers between a Transmission 
pool and a Gathering pool. 
4.  Pool-to-pool transfers will be allowed between North and South Points.  A 
transportation fee will be incurred. 
5..  Seperate agreements for Gathering (pooling & transport) and Transmission 
(pooling & transport) are needed.

7.  New "PROPOSED" gathering/extraction rates are:
 Gathering: $.3726 .

(IOGA WV is attempting to force Dominion into lowering these rates)
