Dana, per the note you printed out and gave me.

CES gave Enron a riskworks data dump which had not been audited for correct 
pricing at CES. As you know GMS was used at CES for scheduling and billing.

This Dayton Deal was not input into Sitara. I created this deal ticket for 
volume/position not for pricing. Somebody on the CES transition team was 
suppose to verify pricing on all Northeast Deals that was input into Sitara. 
Printout of all Sitara deals was given to Phil Glaessner on January 19th. 
Paul Drexelius met with Scott Goodell and Chris Germany on February 8th to 
verify the pricing on these deals. Not sure how far Scott and Chris have 
gotten to correct the pricing on these deals starting with January 2000. 

Don't mean to pass the buck... but please check with Scott and Chris.

The GMS deal numbers are;

s-dp&L-0070 for 5000/day from 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
s-dp&l-0079 for 5000/day from 12/1/99 to 5/1/2000

I'm guessing the correct pricing exists on these GMS deal tickets and someone 
needs to correct the pricing on the Sitara deals.

This is probably not good news... there will be a ton of pricing 
discrepancies until someone ties GMS to Sitara.
