AGL has posted their September LSR details, so attached is the revised FOM 
numbers.  Also, on TCO 23-5 (COH) there were 7 mmbtu shown as separately 
priced:  per Doug Kinney that deal is not being assigned to New Power, so 
while the required volume isn't changing, the net volume at FOM price goes up 
by 7 mmbtu.  (I took the 7 to 0)

Christina and Scott, I've also attached a preliminary AGL sheet for 9/1 so 
you can begin to assign contract numbers.

David
