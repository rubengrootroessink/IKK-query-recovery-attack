FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is not know at this time.  The well name is Goodwin and is 
located in Barbour County, West Virginia.  This meter will be behind the 
Bridgeport Agg point and is expected to do about 15 dths a day. 

Thanks,
Heidi
