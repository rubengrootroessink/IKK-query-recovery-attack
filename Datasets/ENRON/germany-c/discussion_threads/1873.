Now for the good news, He wants to set in with the ya'll when you meet with
Mary.   I'd just have the meeting then tell him about it.  He also wants them
off the place in 14 days.   I told him no, to chill and that we will buy him
out.   That should hold him off a few days.   So don't move yet on getting my
money together?

Took Barb out to eat last night at Johnny Correno's.   No motorcycle riding 
for
me.

Oh yeah, Don is going to see the Dr. about something to help with his nerves 
and
to stop smoking.  He is going to tell him he is drinking with the stuff that 
he
is taking.   Maybe the Doc can give him something to help settle down all this
hostility.

I'll work on the inventory list tonight.   You need to pull together all the
finical data, CD's etc. that are out and that we  cashed in.   Then we will
stick in new values.  Also need to give a good fair market value on items we 
are
selling so we do not have to pay tax on the stuff right.  If we value the 
place
at $175,000 and sell for less, then we don't have to pay taxes on the money, 
so
I was told.


See Ya.

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal
thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!

Later
