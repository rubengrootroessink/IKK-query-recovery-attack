Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
