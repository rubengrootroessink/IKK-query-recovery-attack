I do not know the meter number.  I just know the OP area and Mkt area, I am 
not
aware of the MLI as I did not anticipate working from home I did not bring my
chart with me.  Please look it up.      NYSEG Op 2 Mkt 21  - the mli will be
listed if you look up NYSEG in Op 2 Mkt 21.
Joann could help you with this if you all don't have access to this 
chart/info.

Thanks.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!
