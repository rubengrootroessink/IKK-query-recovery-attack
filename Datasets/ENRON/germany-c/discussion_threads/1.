Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.
Victor

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel
