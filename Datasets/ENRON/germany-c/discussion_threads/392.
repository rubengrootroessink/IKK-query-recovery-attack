Hey Everybody,

NYSEG  1/26

TGP   46 dth for 1/26.  I need this gas even if you have to go out and 
purchase
it.  Thank you.  If you need to forward this email to Chris Germany so that he
may purchase the gas, please do so.  I tried to copy him, but am not sure that
I have his email address correct.

Thanks!



TCO   was 14  now 18.

Thanks!
