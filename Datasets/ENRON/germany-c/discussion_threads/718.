65534 is 149349 in Sitara
 65403 was 149346 as ENA agent for CES.  I created deal 214854 for April 1 
forward, since Joann has pathed it for March.
 The demand was not correct on the first so I fixed it also.
I will update the sheet when you exit the original.

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 
2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and 
highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.
