Subject: Cut Gas 1/26


I just found out through COH reports that 500 dth delivered to mkt 5-7 via
K38094 (First Energy) did not show up on the 26th of January.

As a result of this and other factors, a total delivery volume to that agg 
pool
went from the 484 dth requested amount to 217 dth.  This was during the OFO
period.  Not sure how we are going to handle the resulting penalties, but just
wanted to make sure that Enron does not pay First Energy for those volumes.
Sorry I was not notified of this cut sooner.

Please let me know if ?s

Kara
