Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209
