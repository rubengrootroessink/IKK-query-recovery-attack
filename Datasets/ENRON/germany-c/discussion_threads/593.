Joan--Thanks.   Our target daily storage withdrawal for TCO storage in March 
is
36,300 dth/day.   Given the warm weather, that may prove to be a problem going
forward.   We'll just have to monitor the situation as it unfolds.

Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.   I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day
from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.   I anticipate that we
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.   We'll figure out day by day how
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom
deadline.     Don't redo your nom for 2/24; just leave it as is.

Thanks.
