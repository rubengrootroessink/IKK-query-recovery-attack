Attached is a list of meters that will be Gatherco stations effective 
4/1/2000.  These stations were formerly on Columbia Gas Transmission and due 
to certain lines being sold to Gatherco, will now be Gatherco stations.  
Also, these meters will all be subject to the $.25 Gatherco gathering rate.  
This list should include all the meters for Enron North American and Columbia 
Energy Services combined.

Let me know if you have any questions.




Thanks,
Heidi
