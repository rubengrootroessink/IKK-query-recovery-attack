FYI!  Commonwealth Energy is going to add two new meter sets to their 
existing CNG contract.  These meters will be at Bridgeport and are expected 
to do about 15 dths a day.  The well names are James R. Kelly #1 and Russell 
Marsh #1.  They are both located in Barbour County, WV.  The meter numbers 
are not known at this time and they will be added with our 10/00 production 
period.

Thanks,
Heidi
