FYI.   Long Ridge Farm Energy is adding two new meters to their existing 
contract.  The meters are going to be in the South pool and the information 
is as follows :

Meter #-3576601 Well Name-Bartlett  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-10 
dth/day
Meter#-3584401  Well Name-Roberts  County-Ritchie  State-WV  Est. Vol.-2 
dth/day

These are big money makers. Ha

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Heidi
