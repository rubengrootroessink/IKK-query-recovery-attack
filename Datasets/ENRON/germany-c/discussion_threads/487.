An afterthought here..... I should have used the term displacement, as we 
would
not be officially bringing in more gas into their system.

Need your assistance.   Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).   We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural 
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.   They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.     However,  could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?   As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.   (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?    As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.   If this would work what would it cost?  Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?
