Following up from my earlier e-mail regarding the primary receipt capacity on 
the CNG FT contract associated with the Cove Point gas;
CNG has indicated that on a peak day they would restrict  the PL1 system to 
primary receipts and deliveries consequently eliminating the WGL redelivery 
option that VNG has utilised in the past several years to deliver the Cove 
Point gas via CNG.  I called Williams to ask if the Cove Point gas that ENA 
has this winter could deliver into CNG, the answer was clearly not until 
April 2002 due to a pressure problem on the Cove Point side.  
I think the emphasis should shift to AGL to pressure TRANSCO to fulfil their 
contractual arrangement or at least provide a financial settlement.
Let me know if I can help in any way.
