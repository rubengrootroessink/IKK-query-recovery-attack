Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was 
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed 
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have January 
and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Paulette

Roman and Paulette,

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's
bill, he can pay this one too.

Thank you for your patience during this transition.
