Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma 
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.   However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy 
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.    Accordingly, 
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on 
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.  
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore 
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

Thanks.

According to GMS, Doug purchased the gas. The period was from Feb'00 -
May'00.
The supplier was Duke. The contract was assigned to Enron.

Enron is probably not familiar with the deal as they did not have to make
any
nominations.  Although, the deal was documented each month on the memos and
spreadsheets that were sent to Enron.  I do not have a contact at Duke.  It
was
my understanding that both parties (Duke and Arma) knew the deal was a
fixed
quantity.

When I was assigned Central Hudson in January I was told that there was one
customer behind the gate and that was Arma Textiles.  Arma was backed 100%
by a
Duke purchase that subseqently went with the Enron sale.  I was informed by
the
previous scheduler that all CES did was to make the nomination based on GMS
at
bidweek.   It was a stand alone deal that CES nominated based on GMS.

Kim,

 I am in the process of assigning this customer to a new marketer. A
review of the file shows a recent correspondence concerning tariff gas
purchased by Arma between Kurt Marburger & Charlie Dalphon. Are you able to
shed any light on the issue? There is a significant outstanding balance and
I
believe the customer has made the decision to stop payment until credits
are
issued for the tariff charges.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Scott
