Here are some changes I made to the July deals I faxed to Brian.

Deal 303654 - sale to CES in Tenn Z6, volume of 450 dth per day.  I killed 
this deal.  My schedulers were trying to be proactive and get good estimates 
in the system for July.

New Deal 315072 - buy from CES in Tetco M3, volume of 315/month.  I created 
this deal to bookout with deal 169036.  The price is IF M3 + $.01.

New Deal 315084 - buy from CES in Tetco M3, volume fo 381/month.  I created 
this deal to bookout with deal 315084.  The price is IF M3 $.01.
