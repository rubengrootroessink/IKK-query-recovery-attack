Would you please set up an Amtel reminder to Chris Germany and me, as follows:
Date of notification:  March 1st, 2000
Message:  Deadline for CES Retail storage volumes is March 15-Call CES and 
remind them.

Chris, I'm having Kim set this up so that you can call CES to get real 
volumes for the Storage Exhibit, since their deadline to provide those 
volumes to us is March 15.  Any questions, let me know.
