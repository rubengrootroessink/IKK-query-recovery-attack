ENA pays 89.17% of the demand  and commodity charges and 100% of the fuel.  
Now we pay the pipelines 100% and Boston Gas reimburses us the difference.  
Our Canadian producer group is charged the whole 89.17% of the transportation 
charges and all of the fuel in their netback pricing.

Hope this answers your question...

Julie  :-)

This is just for my information.  We want to make sure the proper parties are 
listed oon our demand reimbursement worksheet..
