Chris,

Operational note on DPL Columbia Gas SST contract for April:

The total contract volume will decrease from 241,000 to 120,000 on April 
1st.  By the terms of the deal, Dayton will take what they need on a daily 
basis and Enron will have the remainder of the contract MDQ.

Assuming normal system demand at DPL, Enron should have from 70,000 to 95,000 
of this SST contract during the month of April.

ECONOMIC NOTE:

Enron will not have to pay any variable cost (demand or commodity) to Dayton 
until the cumulative usage of the SST contract by DPL and Enron reaches 
9,239,520 /dth.  Based on the historical data compiled by Columbia during the 
course of the asset management deal, this 9.2 dth figure  will not be hit 
until sometime in June or early July.

It is to our advantage to fill this contract up to the max. allowed by DPL on 
a daily basis until this 9.2 figure comes into play.   It is an immediate 
saving of the commodity charge, which will be about $0.015.

I can provide a copy of the actual contract for your review upon request.
