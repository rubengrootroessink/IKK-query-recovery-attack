Please read the attached responses from CES, then we need to get together to 
discuss the value (or lack thereof) of getting this contract.  I have sent 
CES our address to get the Duke contract sent to us so we can consider that 
in the value equation.  Any question, please advise.

Subject: GELP questions



I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract.  First, in the 
agreement's
Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed that GELP has
(or had) in place with various counterparties.  I'm wondering what the status 
of
these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in place, etc.  These
agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
     Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
     Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
     Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
     Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
     CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get
gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
     Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
          Note:  According to the billing calculations, it appears that the 
Duke
supply arrangement must have some
               FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
     Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is
used?  If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter
information from a Bristol RTU.  How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value
proposition in this agreement?  I understand that there is a $5000 fee you
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities.  Since
the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the
"winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation),
there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.   Are there other values 
you
see to this deal that we may be missing?

Thanks for your assistance.
