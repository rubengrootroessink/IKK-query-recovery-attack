Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request, 
EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes 
with a status other than "expected" which means we have to work on that 
behind the scenes.  Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving 
all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15 
minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all 
open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open 
the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange 
says "inconsistent".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for 
6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click 
on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the 
correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field, 
make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes 
are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken 
out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If 
the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the 
deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all 
deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked 
to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you 
won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the 
swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go 
to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the 
correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any 
questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.
