I apologize for the late email, but it was quite a week of meetings.  We had
71 people at the meeting the last time that I counted.  We had 13 speakers
and a mutlitude of homeowners.  The candidates were impressed that we had so
many people at a meeting - without food!  Clear Creek Village has the
wonderful reputation of being very active in the community and other
neighborhoods are beginning to look at us to see why we are so successful.  I
hate to list the speakers for fear of misspelling someone or having the
incorrect position for which they are running.  I am sure that someone will
let me know if I am wrong.  The speakers drew numbers and spoke for three
minutes in the following order:
  Leola Hancock, Galveston County Republican Chair
  Katheleen McCumber, JP Pct 8, Pos 1
  Mike Hembree, City Council, League City
  Ed Sebesta, County Comm, Pct 4
  Tommy Cones, City Council, League City
  Chris Mallios, County Comm, Pct 4
  Theresa Tungate, Speaking on behalf of the swim teams for the community
center
  Richard Tindall ,  JP, Pct 8, Pl 1
  Chris Stevens, Galv. Cty Clerk
  Larry Taylor, State Representive
  Tad Nelson, State Representative
  David Kilpatrick, City Council, League City
  Ken Clark, County Commm Pct 4
There was a question session after all of the speakers.  PLEASE VOTE.  Early
voting on a proposed community center, charter ammendments and City council
ends Tuesday. You can vote early at city hall, 300 W. Walker St. Hours are 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday and Tuesday.  Election Day is February 2, 2002.  Let's
put Clear Creek Village on the map again by ahving a record turn out!
