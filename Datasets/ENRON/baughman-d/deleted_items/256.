Dear Investor,

I know "hope springs eternal," but please don't let
it blind you to what's really going on.

Tech stocks have staged a very impressive rally since
October 1st.  So we're out of the woods, right?  We're
on our way to a new bull market, right?  And
everything is well in technology land, right?

WRONG!

And if you make the same mistake I see many investors
making -- and jump back in tech stocks like it's 1999
all over again -- you will likely lose your shirt.

YOU SEE, much of the rise in tech stocks is attributable
to "short covering" -- and it won't continue with the
breadth and power folks are dreaming of.  Why?  Because
the entire tech sector still has an erratic and
unpredictable earnings outlook.

To simplify it even further, earnings for most tech
companies STINK!

Tech companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning
in red ink.  And most won't have positive earnings news
for the next 7-to-10 months.  That's why most tech
stocks -- while they've popped off their lows -- offer
much greater risk than potential reward for the foreseeable
future.

IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn handsome
profits you can take to the bank -- you must invest in
those companies I call "EARNINGS MONSTERS."

That's the term I use for companies bucking the current
trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from
30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn
anything at all.  These "EARNINGS MONSTERS" are the only
sort of stocks we own at my Blue Chip Growth Advisory.
And they're the only stocks that YOU should even think
of owning now.

I've written to you several times about out "Earnings
Monsters" over the last few months.  And I'm sorry you
haven't yet joined my roster of Blue Chip Growth clients
because you're MISSING OUT:

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we own
at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just strong
earnings growth.  It's already UP 103% for the year!

*PeopleSoft is one of the few tech stocks I own today.
Why?  Solid 30%+ earnings growth so far in 2001.  In fact,
3rd quarter profits "beat the street" by 25%.  The result?
The stock is UP 97% since October 1st.

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in times
like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually recession-proof
business.  It's up a nice, stomach-calming 36% YTD.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is hogging
all the profits.  The company announced chart-topping
earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and its stock is UP
20% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED 251%
since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because it's one of
very few tech stocks that's still an EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the EARNINGS
MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late 1997,
our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-to-1, thanks
to our commitment to earnings quality.  And the advisory I
started in the mid-1980's, MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in
the last 16 years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a company
keeps performing, I love it...things start looking iffy, I
take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We SOLD
Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209% gains overall
from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in Microsoft; 179% in
Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 320% in Dell Computer; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  All stocks we SOLD
last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's why I
urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip Growth.  It's
simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR PROFITS -- in any kind of
market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

P.S. Overall, insider buying is the strongest it has been in
years.  That's great news -- but not for tech stocks.  In
fact, many tech insiders are SELLING to raise money for taxes
they owe on options conversions last year.  That'll just knock
many tech stocks for a loop again.  So stay away!  Buy our
EARNINGS MONSTERS instead.  Click here now:
