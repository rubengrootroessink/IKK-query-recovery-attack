Please plan to attend our first CCV Civic Association Meeting of 2002.  We
will meet at Christus Victor Lutheran Church at 7:30 PM, Monday, January 21.
In addition to the regular CCV business meeting, we will have a
Candidate/Political Issues Forum.  The following is a partial listing of the
individuals who have requested to speak:

Mr. Tommy Cones
Mr. Ken Clark
Mr. Mike Clawson
Mr. David Kilpatrick
Mr. Tad Nelson
Mr. Ed Sebesta
Mr. Larry Taylor
Representative from the swim team to discuss the proposed community center

We have asked that each person  speak no longer than 5 minutes.  A question
and answer period will follow the presentations.  It is a compliment to our
neighborhood that we have so many individuals who want to take the time to
inform us of their views.  We ask that you take the time to attend our
meeting and further demonstrate the interest our homeowners have  in our
city and community.

Thank you Peggy for the reminder.  Mary G. Strickland
