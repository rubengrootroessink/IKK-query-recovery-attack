1. 2001 Portfolio +36%; 2002 Portfolio Just Released (C)

In December 2000, Frank Curzio issued a portfolio of 10 stocks he
predicted would do well in the coming year. He was right. Despite
the market's troubles, his portfolio gained an impressive +36%.
Aiming for a repeat performance, he just released his portfolio
for 2002. "Do not procrastinate," he advises. "We urge investors
to buy all of our situations. Do not just pick and choose."

One of Curzio's picks is Citigroup (C). The financial services
goliath stands to do well during an economic turnaround
particularly while interest rates remain low. Curzio sees
management making the right moves to boost earnings; for instance,
it will spin-off 20% of its Travelers Insurance group in 2002.

Another Curzio recommendation is to sell short Broadcom (BRCM).
The firm's chips enable broadband digital data transmission to
residences and businesses over communication networks. Curzio
considers today's short-term economic uncertainty and calls the
stock "overvalued" with a P/E multiple near 140. "Look for a
steady pullback throughout the first quarter. Sell short," Curzio
advises.

with a list of picks in key categories for the coming year.

2. Forecast 2002: Mostly Sunny, Particularly for Small Caps (NYFX)

In January 2001, Jim Oberweis made a number of predictions for the
year that hit the bullseye. For example, the market rallied in
early 2001 but fell for most of the year. Small-caps outperformed
large-caps, and short-term interest rates fell sharply while bond
rates rose, eliminating the inverted yield curve. For 2002,
Oberweis sees large-caps returning an average 8% to 10%, well
below the 20% annual average of the 1990s. "We continue to believe
that small-caps will buck the trend and offer very good
opportunities for investors," he predicts.

To capitalize, Oberweis offers a list of five new small-cap picks.
One of these is Nyfix (NYFX). The firm makes electronic trading
systems for brokerages that trade in equities and derivatives.
Blue-chip customers like Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, UBS
Warburg and Merrill Lynch use the Nyfix Network to send trading
orders to exchange floors electronically.

Last quarter, revenues grew a healthy 75% to $11.4 million and
boosted EPS 65% to $0.10. Oberweis sees Nyfix growing revenues
(and EPS) from $24 million ($0.21) in 2000 to $40 million ($0.32)
in 2001 and again to $60 million ($1.05) in 2002. His asset
management clients now own roughly 34,000, and he maintains a buy
sign on the stock.

For more on Jim Oberweis' advice see "Currently Recommended
Stocks," January 2002, The Oberweis Report. Jim Oberweis invests
in small-cap stocks with revenue and earnings growing at least 30%
and mid-caps growing at least 20%.

3. Time to Buy Disney (DIS)

Chuck Carlson admits having a tough time getting excited about
Disney (DIS). For instance, the entertainment giant's theme park
is mired by a sluggish economy, fears of terrorism and erratic gas
prices. The anemic ad market continues to hurt its ABC network,
and its film business has turned in a spotty performance.

Carlson sees today's slump as a buy opportunity. "Disney has brand
names that would make any marketer salivate," he says. The firm
has not had a new hit TV show since "Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire," but Carlson says Disney's creative teams "don't stay
in dry spells for very long." Also, consumers will eventually
start flying to its theme parks again as economic and terrorist
concerns abate.

At today's low prices, stock in Disney is fully discounting bad
earnings for at least the next two quarters, according to Carlson.
Shares are well off their 2000 highs near $44. That means
investors can buy "a quality blue chip at an affordable price,"
Carlson says. He recommends buying as "the stock offers good long-
term upside potential."

2002, DRIP Investor. Chuck Carlson provides guidance to buying
stocks without a broker via dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).

4. Zacks: Biovail Set to Gain 10+% in 2002 (BVF)

Ben Zacks does not beat around the bush about the prospects for
Biovail (BVF). "Investors who buy Biovail in the $54 - $55 range
can expect an appreciation of 10+% over the next 12 months," Zacks
says. The firm makes medicines based on its proprietary oral
controlled-release drug delivery technology. Its biggest hit is
Tiazac, a treatment for hypertension and angina. Tiazac beats
competing drugs as it requires only a daily dose and has fewer
side effects.

Zacks lists many other reasons why Biovail is a good bet for 2002.
For example, revenues last quarter grew 63% to $152.2 million, net
income rose 37% to $55.8 million, and the firm beat analyst EPS
estimates of $0.36 by a penny a share. Also, Biovail just inked a
host of marketing pacts with Glaxo Smith Kline that should boost
sales.

Biovail shares are not cheap at 33x EPS estimates of $1.66 for
2002. But Zacks remains optimistic. "The high valuation is
justified by the company's high long-term EPS growth rate of 30%,"
he says. He agrees with six of the 16 analysts covering Biovail
who maintain a 'strong buy' rating.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see "Stock Pick of the Month,"
January 2002, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses earnings estimate
revisions from analysts at brokerages to select stocks likely to
outperform the market over the next 12 months.

5. Smallest Stocks are the Places to Be (BLPG)

The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks just chalked up its
third straight year of outperformance by advancing 1% vs. a -13%
slump for the S&P 500. Rich Moroney sees more growth like this in
2002 as small-stock cycles like this one "tend to persist." In
particular, micro-caps should see another great year even after
providing the bulk of last year's growth.

Moroney profiles two micro-caps he calls "especially promising"
for 2002. The first is Boron, LePore & Associates (BLPG), who
provides marketing, education and sales services to healthcare
providers. The stock jumped 65% since hitting bottom in September
2001 due to profit and terrorism concerns. But Moroney predicts
significant improvements for the December quarter thanks to a
rebound in travel and postponed business.

A consensus of analysts pegs Q4 EPS at $0.21, a gain of 40% over
the same quarter last year. Management forecasts full-year EPS
will reach $0.80 to $0.84. Moroney calls the stock "reasonably
priced" at 20x 2002 estimates and below 1x sales. "The stock, with
support near $12.25, is rated 'buy'," he says.

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see "Featured Report," January
7, 2002, Low Priced Stock Survey. Richard Moroney offers
fundamentally solid small- and mid-caps ready to soar 40% to
400%+.
