"Oldy but Goody"
 
 
A Christmas  Tale
One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready  for his annual trip... but there were problems everywhere.
Four of his  elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the  regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind  schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mom was coming to  visit.
This stressed Santa even more. Then when he went to harness the  Reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the  fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress.
Then when he began  to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground,  and scattered the toys.
So, frustrated, Santa went back into the house  for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey.  When he went to the cupboard,  he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to  drink.
In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it  broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor.
He went  to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just  then, the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door  and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas Tree.
The angel  said, very cheerfully, "Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I  have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like  me to stick it?"
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of  the Christmas tree.
