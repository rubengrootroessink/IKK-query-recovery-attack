TECHNOLOGY ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


Jan. 17, 2002

MICROSOFT POSTED a decline in fiscal second-quarter profit, hurt by the weak
economy and a lawsuit-related charge. Revenue, however, rose 18% on strong
demand for its Windows XP operating system and Xbox game system.

IBM PROFIT slightly beat Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter.
But the computer giant missed revenue targets amid weak PC and hardware
sales.
