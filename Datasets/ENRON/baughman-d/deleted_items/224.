Dear Investor,

So far, so good.

My early-October projection of Dow 10,000 by
Thanksgiving came true a few days early.  Now I expect
the market to zigzag its way somewhat higher over the
course of the next two years.

But please, don't go out and "buy the market."  Index
funds and the like may make you richer...but they won't
make you truly RICH.  That's because the gap between
winners and losers will be quite large -- in some
cases HUGE -- in the reawakening ahead.

YOU SEE, in some ways the economic and market
pessimists are RIGHT.  Things are different this time
around.  And it's unwise to expect a rising tide that
lifts all boats.  But the right stocks will pay you
handsomely if you buy them now.

The pessimists may rail about Japan's debt load, the
mess in Argentina and Enron's collapse.  But frankly,
my friend, the sky is not all gray.  We're actually
beginning to see some upward earnings revisions.  And
a handful of stocks we own -- like Cendant, SEI
Investments and Harrah's Entertainment -- are already
UP 40%-to-50% from September's lows.  More will
follow.

As you'll discover, the pessimists are WRONG about the
most important issue: We're not headed for some
deflationary death grip or worldwide economic disaster
-- despite the evidence they cite.  Rather we are in
the midst of economic change -- marked by harsh
competition, rapid innovation and hand wringing --
that is a STOCK PICKER'S DREAM.

And in just a moment, I'll share my finely-honed
strategy for market-beating gains -- one that could
easily make you 50% RICHER by the end of the year.

SO PLEASE excuse me if I don't buy all the doom and
gloom.

I respect the intelligence and opinions of the
pessimists.  But for more than 20 years, I've chosen
to go my own way...discover the facts on my own...and
stand up for what I see.

In fact, I visited 18 countries on five continents
last year.  I live part of the year in Europe; just
visited Argentina to size up that situation for
myself; and regularly spend weeks at a time in Greater
China.  Why?  Because like it or not, we truly live in
a global economy.  And by understanding how it works,
I help my clients SAFELY GROW RICH.

HOW?  A time-tested strategy that identifies hot
growth prospects, when the risk of owning them is near
-- or at -- its lowest point.  That's why the
companies I choose span a host of industries, but they
all have four things in common:

1. Financials that show a company solidly in an upward
trend;
2. Management with a laser-like focus on improving the
bottom line;
3. Distinct competitive advantages within its market
niche;
4. And a stock price selling at the low end of its
usual trading range.

THAT'S THE ONLY WAY to invest for low-risk, fortune-
building gains.  And once you join me, I know you'll
agree.

I've just put the finishing touches on my annual list
of "PROFIT ROCKETS" for my Investor's World clients
and thought you might want a peek, as well.

In fact, you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple
mouse-clicks -- and 100% RISK-FREE, as well.  Since I
first issued this annual forecast back in 1995, my
clients have really cleaned up -- shouldn't you make a
pile of money this year, too?

From the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001,
this annual portfolio of "Profit Rockets" has racked
up a cumulative gain of 287.5%!  That's over a seven-
year period.  Do the division yourself and see how it
looks.  NOT BAD!  And that time period includes the
worst bear market of the last 25 years -- we were
actually UP another 14% in 2001.

Today, I provide this portfolio solely to my
Investor's World clients.  But I first started making
this "annual forecast" in 1995 as a regular panelist
on Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser.

IN 1995, I was #1 among over 20 world-class investors
with gains of 63.3% -- as audited by Bloomberg.  In
1996, I "slipped" to #2.  And in 1999, I just missed
out on top honors with a NICE FAT 60.4% GAIN.

And frankly, I've been helping investors like you to
oversized gains for more than twenty years now.

When the pessimists cried that oil was going to $100 a
barrel in the 1980s, I led my clients to the rational
truth and more big profits.  After the crash of 1987,
I debated every pessimist I could find.  And back in
1993 -- with stocks in the dumps and the pessimists
having a field day -- I told clients to buy for the
greatest bull market in history.

I was right each time.  And I'm staking my reputation
-- and my own money -- on the well-considered belief
that I'm right again.

So please, I urge you, try my Investor's World
advisory RISK-FREE.  As soon as you sign up, you'll
