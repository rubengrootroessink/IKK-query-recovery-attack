How Old Are You, Grandpa?


One evening a grandson was talking to his grandfather about current

events.


He asked what he thought about the shootings at schools, the computer

age, and just things in general.


The granddad replied, "Well, let me think a minute ... I was born

before television, penicillin, polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox,

contact lenses, Frisbees and the pill.


There was no radar, credit cards, laser beams or ball-point pens. Man

had not invented pantyhose, air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers,

well the clothes were hung out to dry in

the fresh air and man hadn't yet walked on the moon.


Your grandmother and I got married first, and then lived together.

Every family had a father and a mother, and every boy over

14 had a rifle that his dad taught him how to use and respect. And

they went hunting and fishing together. Until I was 25, I

called every man older than I, 'Sir'-and after I turned 25, I still

called policemen and every man with a title, 'Sir.' Sundays were

set aside for going to church as a family, helping those in need, and

visiting with family or neighbors.


We were before gay-rights, computer-dating, dual careers, daycare

centers, and group therapy.


Our lives were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and

common sense. We were taught to know the

difference between right and wrong and to stand up and take

responsibility for our actions.


Serving your country was a privilege; living here was a bigger

privilege.


We thought fast food was what people ate during Lent. Having a

meaningful relationship meant getting along with your

cousins.


Draft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the

evening breeze started.


Time-sharing meant time the family spent together in the evenings and

weekends-not purchasing condominiums.


We never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters,

yogurt, or guys wearing earrings. We listened to the Big

Bands, Jack Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios. And I

don't ever remember any kid blowing his brains out

listening to Tommy Dorsey.


If you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk.


The term 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam.


Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of. We had 5 &


10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and 10 cents.


Ice cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were

all a nickel. And if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your nicke=
l

on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards.


You could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600, but who could afford one?

Too bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon.


In my day, 'grass' was mowed, 'coke' was a cold drink, 'pot' was

something your mother cooked in, and 'rock music' was your

grandmother's lullaby.


'Aids' were helpers in the Principal's office, 'chip' meant a piece

of wood, 'hardware' was found in a hardware store, and

'software' wasn't even a word.


And we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady

needed a husband to have a baby.


No wonder people call us "old and confused" and say there is a

generation gap and how old do you think I am - ????


...... This man would be only 59 years old.
