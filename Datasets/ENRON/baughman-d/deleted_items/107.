> WAIT TILL YOU READ THIS ONE!! ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??  --  IT WAS 1987!
>
> At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt.
> Col.Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
> Reagan Administration.  There was Ollie in front of God and country
> getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!!
>
> He was being drilled by some senator; "Did you not recently spend
> close to $60,000 for a home security system?"
> Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir."
>
> The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience,
> "Isn't this just a little excessive?"
> "No sir," continued Ollie.
>
> "No? And why not?" the senator asked.
> "Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir."
>
> 'Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.
> "By a terrorist, sir." Ollie answered.
>
> "Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?"
> "His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.
>
> At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
> pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple
> of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.
>
> "Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.
> "Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of," Ollie
> answered.
>
> "And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator.
> "Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an assassin
> team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the
> earth."
>
> The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that was
> shown of the clip.
>
> By the way......
> The Senator that was questioning Ollie was named Al Gore!
