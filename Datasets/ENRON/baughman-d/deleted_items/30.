League City to Elect New Council Member
 Ballot Includes Open Council Seat, Community Center and Charter Amendments
   League City voters will decide on Saturday who will replace City Council
Member Tad Nelson who resigned to run for the legislature, whether or not to
build a much-debated community center and the fate of 12 proposed charter
amendments.

Three candidates are seeking the vacant City Council Position 3.  They are
Thomas Cones, a 41-year old firefighter; Mike Hembree, a 36-year old
engineer;  and David Kilpatrick, a 46-year old senior engineering technician.
There are 13 propositions on the Ballot.
Proposition 1 is the vote on whether to construct the proposed community
center.
The remaining propositions are proposed charter amendments:.
Proposition 2 would move the regular election of the mayor and council
members to the first Saturday in May and specify the procedures for a runoff
election.  The charter currently calls for elections in April.
Proposition 3 increases the dollar amount of contracts that the city council
may approve, to come into compliance with state law.
Proposition No. 4 is similar in wording to Proposition 1, but amending
another section of the charter, specifying that the regular election for
mayor and council members whose terms are expiring shall be held on the first
Saturday of May.
Proposition 5 makes the charter gender neutral and specifies the time frame
for filing for mayor and council elections.
Proposition 6 requires that a winning candidate receive a majority of the
votes, rather than a plurality.
Proposition 7 requires that persons signing petitions for initiative or
referendum have been registered to vote in the last general city election.
Proposition 8 would bring the language of the one section of the charter out
of the 20th Century, specifying "the year ____" rather than "the year 19__"?
Proposition 9 increases the amount that the city manager can spend without a
vote of the city council from $2,000 to the limit set by the state
constitution.
Proposition 10 takes the city council out of the process of making renditions
of the value of personal property, and requires that any inventory of any
taxable personal property in the city must be filed by April 15 of each year.
Proposition 11 would require that the city council cast votes for the Board
of Directors of the Galveston County Central Appraisal District.
Proposition 12 would specify that the central appraisal district not be
required to "make separate appraisals of joint or conflicting interests in
real property."
Proposition 13 specifies that "early voting" will be treated the same as
"absentee voting".
The Guidry News Service Online News Station will provide election returns
Saturday night.
