Dear Investor,

Thanks to "Siggy," this tech Blue Chip ROSE 29% in
2001. And it's taking new territory so aggressively
that Oracle's Larry Ellison is tearing his hair out.

29% GAINS! That's an amazing number when you consider
two points:

1. This isn't some small-fry bucking the trend because
of some lucky break.

2. It's one of the BIG BOYS of technology, having a
good year when virtually every other big boy from
Cisco to Oracle to Intel has suffered badly.

CAN YOU IMAGINE how well this stock will do when the
economy and sentiment turns!  Siggy is HOT.  And it's
going to make us a ton of money in the months and
years ahead--say, 50% in 6 months and a small fortune
after that.

But what is this "Siggy thing," you might ask.  It's a
transistor, SiGe (nicknamed Siggy) more than 100-times
faster than Intel's screaming Pentium 4--made by the
same company that first discovered that silicon
germanium could soup up chip performance.  This
technology is new--introduced for the first time in
1999.  But it's taking the entire industry by storm.

Worldwide sales were a few million dollars in 1999,
but projections make this at least a $2 billion
product in less than 5 years!  Here's the short story.

First you plop a 200-atom thick layer of silicon
germanium on an old garden-variety silicon chip.  Then
you redesign the vertical bipolar transistor for
increased efficiency.  And bingo, you're the proud
parent of the world's fastest silicon transistor.

HOW FAST IS IT?  It turns on and off over 200 billion
times a second!  Running Siggy against a Pentium is
like running a Ducati 996R superbike against a Vespa
scooter!   What does this speed mean?  Here's one
example.  Souped-up silicon chips delivering mega
amounts of data to homes is a wireless dream about to
come true.  There's no need to run expensive cables.
The LAST-MILE barrier to broadband is hurdled without
wires!

But there's a LOT MORE to Siggy's story than just
that.  Nothing--and I mean nothing--up to now has come
close to Siggy's performance and versatility.  As I've
already said, it's blazing fast--a critical factor in
high-speed communications.  Yet it draws incredibly
little power at the same time--a boon that is finally
making the next generation of wireless technologies
possible.  What's more, this chip creates
exceptionally little background "noise," making it
ideal for applications that depend on high
sensitivity.

So how is this technology being used--and who's using
it?

Siggy's MOST IMPORTANT application is in all facets of
high-speed communications.  If you knew what you were
looking for, you'd find this chip in Internet
appliances, cell phones, storage modules, base
stations, broadband networks, wireless on-site
networks and more.  Virtually everywhere that HIGH-
SPEED communications makes its mark.  Both analog and
digital, as well.  Time Domain Corp.--#1 globally in
Ultra Wideband wireless technology uses Siggy to power
its performance and profits.  Companies like Vitesse
and  Sierra Monolithics find Siggy a crucial component
in the high-end equipment that makes fiber optic
communications possible.  Alcatel is big on Siggy for
being key to affordable high-performance networks.

The list goes on and on.  It seems that barely a day
goes by that Siggy's corporate parent doesn't announce
new accolades--and big new contracts--for its
offspring.

THAT'S PRETTY NEAT when you consider this company's
background.  As I mentioned earlier, it's huge and
incredibly profitable.  In fact, right now this firm
has Larry Ellison tearing his hair out, as it
overtakes Oracle on its own database turf.

But up until a few years ago, this company didn't even
make chips for "outside consumption."  Of course, when
you've got hot technologies--and Siggy is just one of
many--why not take advantage.

Today, this firm does about $3 billion in annual chip
sales--and we're not talking those run-of-the-mill
chips that everyone from California to Taiwan knows
how to make.  This outfit specializes in custom-built,
high-end models like Siggy, where they have a
technological edge--and FAT profit margins.
