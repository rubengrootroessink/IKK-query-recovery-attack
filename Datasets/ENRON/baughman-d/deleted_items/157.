Dear Investor,

People know me as a "diehard" technology investor.  So
it's sure to surprise many of them when I say:

Most investors WON'T make a dime this year in
technology stocks.

That's because the old game is over.  No more buying
frenzy.  No return to the anything-works days of 1999.
And no easy-pickings.

That's the BAD NEWS.

The GOOD NEWS?  We're already enjoying a new feast of
profits that can make you 75%-to-100% RICHER by this
time next year.  But most investors -- sadly --will
miss out.

That's because the technology "boom" has passed its
revolutionary stage...and turned into an EVOLUTIONARY
process that will give most companies fits.  Good
ideas and innovation are no longer enough.  Execution,
size and financial strength matter MUCH more today.

A ton more "great" companies with "great" technologies
and "great" people will badly disappoint Wall Street
in the coming months.  And any investor using the OLD
rules for investing in tech stocks will get creamed!

YOU CAN SEE it in the old-time tech giants like
Hewlett-Packard and Ericsson that are uncompetitive
today.  You can see it in not-for-profit business
model of Amazon.com.  And you can see it in all the
little gee-whiz technology companies that have tumbled
like bowling pins on league night.

In my view, "betting on tech stocks" today is like a
trip to Vegas without any of the fun.  But -- and
here's the good part -- you can still MAKE YOUR
FORTUNE by investing in those few powerhouses that
still lord above the rest in this incredibly
competitive industry.

In fact, since the beginning of October my entire
POWERHOUSE portfolio (that's every single stock I
recommend, not some made-up "best of" list) is UP 40%.
How about you?  Are you making money like this --
right now -- or are you missing out???

Take a look at some of the stocks my clients and I own
-- and how well they're doing RIGHT NOW:

*I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of the
fast-growing biotech firm Immunex.  When that deal was
announced, it included a 17% premium.  But we've done
much better.  In fact, we just sold for banked 105%
GAINS in just 8-months' time.

*Analysts are jumping back on the cell phone
bandwagon.  Why?  New personal security issues;
soaring sales in China; and a generational shift in
technologies.  Powerhouse Nokia is UP 44% since in
October 1st.

*We're seeing a major shift in how microchips are
manufactured, thanks to the next generation of
technological innovations.  And that means big profits
for the top contract manufacturers like Taiwan
Semiconductor.  We're UP 91% over the same timeframe.

*Of course, security is a HUGE issue now.  And many of
the answers that will make our lives and businesses
more secure are technology-based.  Security POWERHOUSE
Check Point Systems is UP 76%.

*What's more, we're making money in nearly every tech
sector, thanks to our laser-like selectivity.  Even
the beleaguered enterprise software sector has been
good to us -- since the beginning of October, our
stake in Peoplesoft has SOARED 116%!

As you can see, we've made a TON of money already.
And so, you might ask, "Is it TOO LATE for me?"

No.  In fact, you can match these profits in the
coming months -- even beat them; but there is ONE
CATCH.  You must act now.

YOU CAN'T afford to disregard my invitation to join
Technology Investing any longer.  As our recent gains
prove, we are in the midst of a POTENT profit run that
can make you a small fortune in 2002.  But not if you
just sit on your hands.

Several of our stocks that have made huge moves
already still have much further to run.  Join me at
Technology Investing, and I'll tell you which ones --
and why.  Other stocks that have done little so far
are on the verge of rallies that could easily DOUBLE
your money from here.

That's because all tech sectors WON'T come back at
once.  In fact, some won't come back at all.  I'll
help you avoid those many stocks destined to go
nowhere in 2002.  We'll simply move from wave to wave
of profits -- for fun that lasts the entire blessed
year -- instead.

So please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-
time if you miss out. Get my TOP current wealth-
builders now, by accepting a 100% RISK-FREE trial
subscription to my Technology Investing advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can BANK 75%-to-100% gains this year alone
in the top technology stocks.

So take a look at Technology Investing to see what you
think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  Since October 1st, our entire holdings -- not
cherry-picked, the complete list -- are UP 40%.

And back in 1999 -- after the last big stock market
panic -- we saw what most folks were missing and piled
into select tech stocks for 157% GAINS, as verified by
The Hulbert Financial Digest.  That's without risking
a dime on the dot-com craze!  While I'm not looking
for an exact repeat performance in 2002, I do expect
to earn 75%-to-100% PROFITS in my top tech stocks.
Unfortunately, most investors will just miss out
again.

Don't you miss out.  Go here now:
