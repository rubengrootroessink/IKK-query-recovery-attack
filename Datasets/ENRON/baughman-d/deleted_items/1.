Independent Equity Analysis
from IDEAadvisor

In case you missed it the first time around, here it is again. The same list published on
January 18th 2002 is now available at 40% of the original price. For a one-time charge
of only $19 you can purchase IDEA's Top 10 Stock Picks. That's less than $2 per stock
recommendation. Offer valid till February 18, 2002

IDEA's Top 10 Stock Picks looks at 10 stocks we believe will be strong performers in
2002 and beyond -- not just from a stock growth perspective, but also as representing
companies that will lead their respective sectors and industries. Market conditions early
in 2002 are bound to be volatile, and we have chosen the stocks we believe are both fairly
valued and offer stable growth.

In our last major recommended list, released on September 28, 2001, we listed 13
stocks that we felt traded at price-to-free cash flow discounts to the market. The first nine
names on the list we noted for also carrying a higher dividend than the average S&P 500
company at 1.5% at that time; the last four we noted for their exceptionally low multiples
of price-to-free cash flow. And while emphasizing stability over growth in a time of
tremendous market uncertainty, we managed to pick 13 stocks which have yielded an
average return of almost 28% in less than four months (versus 10% growth in the S&P
500 over the same period).

Still not convinced? Why not SAMPLE an older Recommended List!  Our next list will
be available for Pay Per View purchase in Quarter 2, 2002.
