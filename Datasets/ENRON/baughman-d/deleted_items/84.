Subject:	The Senior Citizen and the State Trooper


Hit you all with a funny early this morning! Holla


The Senior Citizen and the State Trooper
There was a middle aged guy who bought a brand new Mercedes Convertible SLK.
He took off down the road, flooring it up to 80 mph and enjoying the wind
blowing through what little hair he had left on his head.
"This is great," he thought and floored it some more. He looked in
his
rearview mirror and there was a Florida Highway Patrol Trooper behind
him,
bullfights flashing and siren blasting. "I can get away from him with no
problem," thought the man and he floored it some more and flew down the
road
at over 100 mph. Then he thought, "What am I doing? I'm too old for this
kind of thing" and pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the
State Trooper to catch up with him.  The Trooper pulled in behind the
Mercedes and walked up to the man.  "Sir," he said, looking at his watch.
"My shift ends in 30 minutes and today is Friday the 13th. If you can give
me a reason why you were speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you
go."
The man looked at the Trooper and said, "Last week my wife ran off with a
State Trooper, and I thought you were bringing her back." The State Trooper
said, "Have a nice day."
