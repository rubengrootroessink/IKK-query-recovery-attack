 may be tempted to put these two guys out of there mysery, for killing
such a
 good dog!!!

OUCH

Very good read. At least it was a black lab and not a yellow one!

Take 2 minutes to read this.it's worth it!

Sounds like a Darwin award:

 Two hunters from Michigan--(true story) This is from a radio program,
> a true report of an incident in Michigan:
>
> A guy buys a brand new Lincoln Navigator for $42,500 and has $560
> monthly payments. He and a friend go duck hunting in winter, and of
> course all the lakes are frozen. These two guys go out on the lake
with
> the guns, the dog, and the new vehicle.
>
> They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready. Now, they want to
> make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks, something for
> the decoys to float on. In order to make a hole large enough to look
> like something a wandering duck would fly down and land on, it is
> going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill.
>
> So, out of the back of the new Navigator comes a stick of dynamite
> with a short, 40-second fuse. Now these two Rocket Scientists do
> take into consideration that they want to place the stick of dynamite
> on the ice at a location far from where they are standing (and the
new

> Navigator), because they don't want to take the risk of slipping on
the
> ice when they run from the burning fuse and possibly go up in smoke
> with the resulting blast.
>
> They light the 40-second fuse and throw the dynamite. Remember a
> couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the vehicle, the guns and
> the dog? Let's talk about the dog: A highly trained Black Lab used
for

> RETRIEVING. Especially things thrown by the owner. You guessed

cap-
> tures the stick of dynamite with the burning 40-second fuse about the
> time it hits the ice.
>
> The two men yell, scream, wave their arms and wonder what to do
> now. The dog, cheered on, keeps coming. One of the guys grabs the
> shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with # 8 buckshot,
> hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab. The dog stops for a moment,
> slightly confused, but continues on. Another shot and this time the
dog,
> still standing, becomes really confused and of course terrified,
thinking
> these two geniuses have gone insane.
>
> The dog takes off to find cover, under the brand new Navigator.
> ----BOOM!---- Dog and Navigator are blown to bits and sink to
> the bottom of the lake in a very large hole, leaving the two idiots
standing there with this "I can't believe this happened" look on their
faces.
>
> The insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by
illegal
> use of explosives is not covered. He still had yet to make the first
of those $560 a month payments!
>
> And you thought your day was not going well!!
