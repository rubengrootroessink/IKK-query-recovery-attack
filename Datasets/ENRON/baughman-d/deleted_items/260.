The new telemarketer law went into effect on the 1st.  Apparently it
will
cost you $4.80 to put your name on the "no call" list for 5 years.
Telemarketing companies have to purchase this "no call list" every 3
months
and get 60 days to update their systems.  They will be fined up to
$1,000
per violation.  (debt collectors and charities are exempt)
