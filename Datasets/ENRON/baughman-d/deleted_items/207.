Thank you for contacting Columbia House.

We appreciate you notifying us you wish to
return a shipment.  Before a postage paid
return label can be sent, additional information
is needed.  Please provide the title of each
selection involved, the reason for the return,
replacement instructions and your eleven-digit

the matter will be given our prompt attention.

You can be assured of receiving only those
