Dear Investor,

Coming out of the stock market crash, nearly every
investor has a story about "the stock I've learned to
hate."

For some folks, names like Amazon.com and Yahoo make
their BLOOD BOIL.  Others cringe at the mention of
former industry leaders like Lucent Technology.  Still
more wonder what the heck's wrong with Disney or
Charles Schwab.

But there's one company, in particular, that leaves
investors wondering, "WHAT WENT WRONG?"

Not because that company plunged into bankruptcy or
pulled a fast one like Enron.  But simply because this
name seemed so full of promise...that investors were
shocked, saddened and hurt when it fell.

AND THAT'S THE STOCK I'm writing to you about -- and
urging you to buy -- today.

It's one I never owned up until now.  In fact, you
might say it's a stock I used to hate.  But now --
when many investors have jumped this ship -- I'm
telling my Technology Investing clients to "BUY" with
both hands.  And I'm projecting MONEY-DOUBLING gains
in the next 12 months -- plus a great shot at truly
wealth-building profits over the next several years.

In just a moment, you'll learn how to get the name of
my newest investment -- plus all the details on my
other top holdings -- absolutely RISK-FREE.

BUT FIRST, let me share the highlights of this
intriguing story with you now.

This wireless whippersnapper was the poster-child of
the "run tech stocks to the moon" crowd.  The company
-- and everyone associated with it -- touted its new
communications technology as the most significant
breakthrough since man first learned to talk.

No wonder the stock took off like a rocket.  Starting
in January 1999, Wall Street's "tech touts" ran it all
the way to $200 on the strength of their glowing
reviews.  In fact, they told investors that the best
was yet to come -- so every time the stock dipped,
people didn't sell, they just bought more!

WHAT A MISTAKE.  I just shook my head at the nonsense
and stayed the heck away.  You see, I couldn't see any
more basis for that mania than for buying "who-cares-
about-profits" Amazon.com.  While the dream of its new
technology sounded great...the reality was a totally
different thing indeed.

Simply put, these guys talked a good game, but their
products DIDN'T WORK!

I had a friend, who learned this the hard way.  She
won a few cellular licenses at auction about five
years ago and chose this company as a supplier --
against my heartfelt advice.  So she went to their
plant for a demonstration and NOTHING WORKED.  They
claimed they were going to revolutionize the whole
communications industry, and she couldn't even make a
simple phone call!

And trust me, she wasn't the only one FOOLED.  Both
Lucent and Motorola committed to supporting this
technology as the new industry standard.  And they got
HURT BAD when the whole thing unraveled.

Of course, no one got hurt as bad as unsuspecting
investors, who saw the value of their holdings SLASHED
SOME 80%!  So you can't blame those folks if they hate
this stock and say, "Never, never again!"

BUT THAT'S A CRYING SHAME.  Because this company's
engineers have been working very, very hard behind-
the-scenes.  And guess what!  Now the technology DOES
WORK.  It's "knock-your-socks-off stuff" -- just a few
years later than promised.

And it's going to make my Technology Investing clients
-- you, too, I hope -- a pile of money just ahead.

It's funny, really.  Telecom companies committed to
this communications standard when they never should
have.  But once they did, they signed on for the long
haul.  And now this company--which I'm finally buying
-- will reap the rewards.

AND WE'LL PROFIT with them.

Up to very recently, two competing technologies -- GSM
and CDMA -- were still in the running for wireless
supremacy across the globe.  They were battling to
become the standard for next generation cell phones --
featuring Internet access, email, instant messaging
and other broadband applications.

But now the battle is over.  This company's CDMA
technology -- now that it finally works as promised --
has won out.  And not only is their technology used in
many phones today -- it will be used in ALL future
phones, going forward.

The fun for investors starts now -- and lasts for many
years to come.  Soon the day will come when this
company is paid a royalty on every cell phone sold.
THAT'S HUGE.

Near term, I'm looking to DOUBLE OUR MONEY in the next
12 months.  Longer term, I hate to put a ceiling on
how high this stock could go.  That would be like
having put a limit on Microsoft, Dell or Intel in the
early days -- you're almost sure to miss on the low
side.

DON'T MISS OUT.  Get this company's name --
immediately online -- by accepting a 100% RISK-FREE
trial subscription to my Technology Investing
advisory.  Of course, you'll also get immediate access
to our Web site where you can read current and past
issues of my monthly newsletter.  And I'll send you
introductory reports, especially for new clients, as
well.

Once you join, take a full six months to measure the
value of my advice for yourself.  Don't like what you
see...don't make the profits you want, just cancel, and
your subscription DOESN'T COST YOU A DIME.   That's
reason enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right
--and I'm staking my reputation and my own money on
this call -- you can double your money, at least, in
2002...and make a small fortune over the next two years.

So please, give yourself a chance.  At least take a
look at Technology Investing to see what you think.
Our unusual six-month guarantee of total satisfaction
means my advisory costs you nothing if you don't 100%
approve.

P.S.  Next time this stock hits $200 a share, it will
be base on merit -- not hype and wishful thinking.
That's a 300% MOVE from here -- a nice profit binge
that I'd hate to see you miss.  My target is a double
in twelve months, then it's onwards and upwards from
there.

Most investors who owned this stock before will miss
out.  They bought way too early on bad advice.  But
not my Technology Investing clients.  Now the
technology -- and the opportunity -- are both very,
very real.  CLICK HERE to join us for the delightful
profits straight ahead:
