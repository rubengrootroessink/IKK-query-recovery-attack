Subject:	FW: Painting in the Nude



>Two nuns are ordered to paint a room in the convent which is being
>renovated, and the last instruction of the Mother Superioris was that they
>must not get even a drop of paint on their habits. After conferring about
>this for a while, the two nuns decide to lock the door of the room, strip
>off their habits, and paint in the nude.
>
>In the middle of the project, there comes a knock at the door. "Who is it?"

>calls one of the nuns. "Blind man," replies a voice from the other side of
>the door.
>
>The two nuns look at each other, shrug, and decide that no harm can come
>from letting a blind man into the room. They open the door, and a man
>enters. "Nice boobs," says the man. "Where do you want these blinds?"
