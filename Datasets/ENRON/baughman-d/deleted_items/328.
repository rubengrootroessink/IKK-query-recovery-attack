Dear Investor,

Remember the smiley-faced mayor in the movie Jaws...

...telling all the tourists that it was "safe" to go
back into the water?  He had dollar-signs where his
heart should have been.  Lying for the sake of money.
Pushing more people right into the jaws of the Great
White Shark!

Today, a very similar thing is happening now on Wall
Street.  And if you listen to the "all-is-well"
analysts, brokers and investment advisors, you're
going to end up SHARK-BAIT, too,

YOU SEE, everything ISN'T all right.  Not by a long
shot.  The economy stinks -- unemployment is at a
decade's high; consumer confidence is shot; and we're
in a nasty recession.  Does that sound like the right
prescription for a broad-based, sustainable market
rally?

Of course not.  I'd bet on Osama Bin Laden turning
himself in, before I'd bet even one dollar on "the
market,"

BUT -- and this is a very critical point -- just
because the market is a mess...doesn't mean you can't
make a lot of money.  YOU CAN -- if you understand the
only smart way to invest now.

Why are so many stocks down 30%, 50%, 70% or more from
their highs?  SIMPLE -- their earnings have sunk like
rocks in the middle of the ocean.  And there's no sign
these companies' profits are coming back anytime soon.
The biggest PROBLEM CHILD?  Technology.  Tech
companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning
in red ink.  And while their stocks occasionally give
you short-term bounces...they offer little in the way of
lasting gains.

IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn
handsome profits you can take to the bank -- you must
invest in those companies I call "EARNINGS MONSTERS."

That's the term I use for companies bucking the
current trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from
30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn
anything at all.  These "EARNINGS MONSTERS" are the
only sort of stocks we own at my Blue Chip Growth
Advisory.  And they're the only stocks that YOU should
even think of owning now.

I've written to you several times about out "Earnings
Monsters" over the last few months.  And I'm sorry you
haven't yet joined my roster of Blue Chip Growth
clients because you're MISSING OUT:

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  It's already UP 92% for the
year!

*PeopleSoft is one of the few tech stocks I own today.
Why?  Solid 30%+ earnings growth so far in 2001.  In
fact, 3rd quarter profits "beat the street" by 25%.
The result?  The stock is UP 105% since October 1st.

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  It's up a nice, stomach-
calming 34% YTD.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and its
stock is UP 21% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
193% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the
EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started 16 years ago, MPT Review,
has GAINED 3,850% in that time, according to The
Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We
SOLD Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209%
gains overall from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart.  All
stocks we SOLD last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

Today, consensus opinion states that 10 rate cuts...tax
rebates...one round of tax cuts with more to follow...and
a stimulus package that could reach $100 billion, will
combine to KICK-START the economy again.  Problem is,
with everything that has happened, no one knows
exactly when.

But if you own today's EARNINGS MONSTERS, you don't
have to worry.  You can make money now -- and bank
even BIGGER GAINS once a shred of optimism returns to
the overall market.  Quick 30%, 40%, 50% pops that
lead to profits like we banked previously from Dell
Computer (+320.%), Vodafone AirTouch (+196.0%) and
Nokia (+316.%)...back when these companies were EARNING
MONSTERS, too.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up

P.S. Profits at most companies have fallen off a
cliff.  But not at the companies we own at BLUE CHIP
GROWTH.  Over the past three quarters our EARNINGS
MONSTERS met or BEAT expectations about 95% of the
time -- and we're seeing nice gains, even in this
difficult time.  Please join us and get your full
