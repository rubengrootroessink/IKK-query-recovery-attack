   Lisa,

   As per our conversation on Monday, don.baughman@enron.com will be valid for
   another week or so.  As soon as I find out what the new email address will
   be, I'll send you an email.

   Thanks for sending the daily MWD Hourly Index and historicals (if possible)
   for Dec.2001 and Jan.2002.

   I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial relationship between UBS
   Warburg Energy and Platts.
