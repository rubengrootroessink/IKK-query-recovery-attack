New sector fund "Buy" issued for Fabian Sector
Investing subscribers.  Get in now and enjoy the
next 30 day's profits FOR FREE!

Dear InvestorPlace.com Insights Reader,

There's usually a bull market going on somewhere, if
you know where to look!

The recent rally in several key market sectors
presents some enticing opportunities for those of you
who are willing to take a more aggressive investing
posture.  In fact, my last "Buy" recommendation -- in
the Tech Sector -- has already jumped 18% in just a
few short weeks.

I'm writing to you today to tell you that I've just
issued ANOTHER sector fund buy signal. Frankly, I'm
even MORE excited about this "Buy" than I was about
the last one.  It's in the Financial Services Sector,
and has the potential to be even bigger for us than
the Tech buy.  And I want to make sure that you DON'T
miss out!  That's why I convinced my publisher to give
you a chance to try my Sector Investing service --
FREE -- for 30 days.

That's right, as a special opportunity for
InvestorPlace.com Insights readers, now you can try
out Fabian Sector Investing for yourself without being
charged a penny for the next 30 days.  Just go to
 http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
and sign up for your free trial today.

You'll get immediate access to all the details on my
new Buy in the Financial Services Sector, PLUS you'll
get to invest in our recommended sector funds, read
our in-depth weekly sector analysis, and book yourself
some healthy sector profits.  If in thirty days you're
not absolutely thrilled with the service--and your
profits--simply call my Customer Service department at
800/950-8765 and let them know, and they'll make sure
your credit card is NEVER CHARGED EVEN A PENNY for
your free month of service.

I think you'll like what you see!

Since I introduced Fabian Sector Investing almost
three years ago, we have dramatically outperformed the
S&P500 and NASDAQ by pulling down major winners like...

*79% profits in INVESCO Technology in just 5 months

*30% profits in Fidelity Retailing in 6 months

*86% profits in INVESCO Leisure in less than 15 months

*20% profits in INVESCO Health in just 50 days

And these results were during a grinding bear market!
From today's depressed price levels, I expect that my
new sector buys will deliver EVEN GREATER profits in
the coming months. The 18%+ profits we racked up over
the past few weeks are just the beginning!

So, if sector investing profits like this sound like
they're right for you, just call 800/950-8765 or go to
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
to sign up for your 30 DAYS FREE of Fabian Sector
Investing today.

Sincerely,

Doug Fabian

P.S. Aggressive sector fund investing requires close
oversight and sometimes active trading.  But the
increased profit potential as compared to typical
mutual fund or stock investing really can be dramatic.
If you're interested in seeing what it's all about,
you'll NEVER get a better opportunity than this. To
get started with the program and lock-in maximum
profits, you must sign-up and make the new buys TODAY.
So please visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
NOW to activate your 30-Day FREE TRIAL.

P. P. S.  Don't miss out!! We've already made more
than 18% in the past few weeks on our last sector buy.
You'll want to get in on the NEW buy right away.  Call
800/950-8765 now or go to
