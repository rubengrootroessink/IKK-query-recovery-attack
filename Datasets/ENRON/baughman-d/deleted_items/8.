I received this information tonight.  Once again, if anyone has any
information, please let us know.  AND, as always, when something happens,
please call the League City Police Department.  They will be glad to help
you.  Mary G. Strickland

Sunday evening, February 3, a vehicle drove through 5 front yards,
1912,1910,1908,1906,1904, Aggie Lane. Keep a look out fellow neighbors. Also,
a trash can from 1910 Aggie was stolen two Fridays ago before trash day.
