The following is a message fro Rusty about the grant that the city got to
purchase the land at the back of CCV:

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

Thanks
Russ
