Saturday March 16, 2002 will be a community clean-up day for Clear Creek
Village.  We will be offering to assist people who need help in the village
and we will be having a community garage sale at the church.  Stay tuned for
further details and get ready to volunteer to help your neighbors.  Mary G.
