Early voting started today at city hall.  Please be sure to vote there are 13
charter ammendments.  You have the pool to consider and various offices.
Please be sure to vote.

The orange cat has returned home and Mr. Williamson reports that he still has
the very friendly balck and white one hanging around his house.  He has cats

hands.  The pound is full of wonderful annimals, so I hate to see another one
go there.
