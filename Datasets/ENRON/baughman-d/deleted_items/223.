Dear Investor,

I've just put the finishing touches on my annual list
of "PROFIT ROCKETS" for my Investor's World clients
and thought you might want a peek, as well.

In fact, you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple
mouse-clicks -- and 100% RISK-FREE, as well.  Since I
first issued this annual forecast back in 1995, my
clients have really cleaned up -- shouldn't you make a
pile of money this year, too?

From the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001,
this annual portfolio of "Profit Rockets" has racked
up a cumulative gain of 287.5%!  That's over a seven-
year period.  Do the division yourself and see how it
looks.  NOT BAD!  And that time period includes the
worst bear market of the last 25 years!

OF COURSE, it helps that we were actually UP another
14% in 2001 -- and that's over the whole year, not
some "after October 1st" rosy look at our holdings.
How many investment advisors can back up that claim?

I've been publishing my Investor's World newsletter
for 20 years now, but I first started making this
"annual forecast" in 1995 as a regular panelist on
Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser.

IN 1995, I was #1 among over 20 world-class investors
with gains of 63.3% -- as audited by Bloomberg.  In
1996, I "slipped" to #2.  And in 1999, I just missed
out on top honors with a NICE FAT 60.4% GAIN.

And remember, we didn't earn those profits with
dangerous bets on dot.coms and the like.  That's not
what we do at Investor's World.  Our motto?  You NEVER
have to take big risks to make a whole lot of money.

HERE'S SOMETHING I think you'll really like: My picks
aren't some risky all-tech, all-the-time crapshoot.
The companies I choose span a host of industries, but
they all have four things in common:

1. Financials that show a company solidly in an upward
trend;
2. Management with a laser-like focus on improving the
bottom line;
3. Distinct competitive advantages within its market
niche;
4. And a stock price selling at the low end of its
usual trading range.

That's the only way to invest for low-risk, fortune-
building gains.

So if you're tired of investing dangerously -- but
still have a love for BIG PROFITS -- I hope you'll
give my Investor's World newsletter a RISK-FREE try.

After all, it's the ONLY WAY to get my 10 Profit
Rockets for 2002.  You see, I stopped giving out this
valuable information on nationwide TV a while back and
made it exclusive to my loyal newsletter readers.

I've been publishing specific recommendations for
individual investors like you since 1982 -- with many
thousands of happy clients.  That's because I've
displayed a knack -- if I may -- for finding great
companies flying under Wall Street's radar...and turning
that knack into BIG PROFITS like these:

*We bought Micron Technology back in 1988 when traders
beat it down because "no American company could
compete with Japanese chip-makers."  Yeah, right.  We
later BANKED 897% gains.

*SEI Corp was Wall Street's whipping boy when traders
hated financial stocks back in 1993.  We loaded up.
And our 1,952% gains so far have turned $20,000 into
more than $400,000.

*We invested in Glaxo -- now GlaxoSmithKline -- when
you couldn't give drug stocks away.  We're up 846% so
far, thanks to our intelligence early on.

AND I COULD TALK about more big winners, too -- like
British Petroleum (+809%), Mannesmann (+1,050%) and
Ahold (+2,828%) -- that we bought ahead of the
crowd...then watched with glee as everyone else piled
in.

Now today, I've just put the finishing touches on my
new PROFIT ROCKET Portfolio for 2002.  My clients are
chomping at the bit to get started.  And I hope you'll
join us for the BIG PROFITS ahead, as well.

You can try Investor's World for six full months RISK-
FREE.  Don't like what you see; don't make more money,
