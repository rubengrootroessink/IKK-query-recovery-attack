Dear Investor,

I guess you've been too busy to respond to my
invitation so far.  And that's a shame.

I've written several times, demonstrating the safest
way to make BIG PROFITS in this market.  I've offered
to let you try my investment advisory RISK-FREE.  And
most importantly, I've shown you exactly how my
clients and I are making a ton of money right now.

Sadly, you've missed out on some really nice gains --
but I'm hoping you'll join us before you miss any
more:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.  And
today -- after a slight pullback -- this generic drug-
maker has RISEN 62% since late March.  That's just
what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 103% since mid-
September!  That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits
I love best.

*You want to see strong growth in retail?  Check out
Best Buy.  The company is grabbing market share and
pumping up the profits -- in fact, it "beat the
street" again this quarter.  Wall Street LOVES a
winner.  The stock SOARED 151% in 2001!

*Conservative General Mills smashed through its all-
time high.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th --
the day after reporting earnings -- this stock closed
UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  That's why it rose a nice,
stomach-calming 32% for the year.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and
its stock is UP 27% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
362% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s, MPT
Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen years,
according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed 466%
gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent;
201% in Cisco.  All stocks we SOLD before they soured.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet! Now business is
booming again for this tech juggernaut, and it's time
to pile back in for our next round of  BIG fortune-
building gains.  Don't miss out this time.  Click here
