Dear Investor,

Did you check out the January 21st cover story of
BusinessWeek?

If not, it's a MUST-READ for any investor in this age
of misinformation.  You see, the Enron debacle is just
the tip of the iceberg waiting to tear a huge hole in
your retirement dreams.  That's because super-
aggressive accounting techniques -- even when,
strictly speaking, not illegal -- have in many cases
drastically overstated how well certain companies have
really done.

And particularly now -- in a tough economic test that
most businesses are failing -- the temptation to use
SMOKE-AND-MIRROR accounting is stronger than ever
before.

THAT'S WHY YOU must be very, very fussy about the
stocks you own today.  And in just a moment, I'll
introduce you to my time-tested strategy that
identifies the true EARNINGS MONSTERS with laser-like
focus...and helps you avoid all the earnings dogs.

Enron, after all, was a huge disaster -- one with many
legal issues still to be decided.  But there are many
more "earnings traps" set to snare unwary investors.

TAKE CISCO, for example.  The BusinessWeek article
quotes Michael Porter of Harvard Business School as
saying, "We will likely find that even during its so-
called heyday, Cisco wasn't nearly as profitable...as
many believed."

Today, Cisco CEO John Chambers is still saying, "I
believe the best years are in front of us."  But
that's a bet I wouldn't make.  Cisco isn't going to
disappear like Enron.  But with analysts beginning to
take a harder look at REAL EARNINGS, it's very
doubtful that Cisco can grow fast enough to justify
its huge market cap.

And once traders take an ax to the stock, you could
lose 30%, 40%, 50% virtually overnight.

FRANKLY, I had concerns about Cisco's future two years
ago.  That's why I told clients of my Blue Chip Growth
advisory to sell and lock in our 201% gains.  And
since we sold, the stock has already dropped 59%

Of course, Cisco isn't the only high-flyer we dumped
before Wall Street caught on to the growing earnings
problem.  We dumped EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed
466% gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot;
179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in Vodafone
Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they collapsed.
That's why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue
Chip Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

AS YOU'LL SEE, we don't own companies that might do
okay when the economy recovers.  We only own companies
that are EARNINGS MONSTERS right now:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.
Since then, it has pulled back slightly, but this
generic drug-maker has RISEN 64% since late March.
That's just what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 96% since October!
That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits I love best.

*Conservative General Mills is a fantastic cornerstone
stock today.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th
-- the day after reporting earnings -- this stock
closed UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  We're up more than 60% so
far!

*What manufacturing recession?  Chopper king Harley
Davidson is hogging all the profits.  The company --
named company of the year by Forbes magazine --
announced chart-topping earnings after-the-bell on
October 9th, and its stock is UP 26% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
over 300% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

And this isn't some short-term success story.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1.  And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s,
MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen
years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

WHY.  Because I'm a very demanding guy.  When a
company slips -- no matter how great it has been -- I
dump it.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet!  We dumped it
because earnings took a turn for the worse.  But now
business is booming again for this tech juggernaut,
and it's time to pile back in for our next round of
BIG fortune-building gains.  Don't miss out this time.
