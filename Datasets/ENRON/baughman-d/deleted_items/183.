> "I sure do." answered the redneck.

> "That's real good." the redneck responded in awe.

> The professor continued: "Logic will also tell me that since you

>
> Impressed, the redneck shouted, "GAWL-LEEE!!"
>
> "And since you own a house and a house is tough to take care of by

>
> "Betty Mae! This is incredible!" (Bubba is obviously catching on.)
>
> "Finally, since you have a wife, logically I can assume that you are

>
> You're absolutely right! Why that's the most fascinatin' thing I

> Bubba, proud of the new world opening up to him, walked back into

>
> "So what classes are ya takin?" he asks.
>
> "Math, history, and logic," replies Bubba.
