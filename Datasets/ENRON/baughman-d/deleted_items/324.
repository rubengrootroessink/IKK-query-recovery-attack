 Technology Today      Microsoft's new operating system, Windows XP, was re=

system?or the money it can make savvy investors who understand where to inv=
est. That's what I want to tell you about today.  You see, Windows XP trans=

 the operating system couldn't handle all the complexities of doing Interne=
t videoconferences.  Well, now it finally can. All it takes is a $100 camer=

te board, any sort of collaborative notes-and hold a productive, real-time =
meeting without ever leaving your desk. It's PERFECT for the home office. A=
 fantastic face-to-face sales tool. Heck, we're installing the cameras all =
over the place at my offices for immediate feedback-something that's of cri=
tical importance in the money management world.  In short, the point I'm tr=
ying to make is that video Internet meetings finally really work-for the fi=
rst time-thanks to Microsoft XP. And I know from experience, there's a huge=
 PENT-UP DEMAND. What's more, the recent terrorist events will only increas=
e the desire for virtual face-to-face meetings, instead of actual travel. N=
ow Let Me Show You What All That Demand Does to Capacity...and How You Can =
Profit From This Trend   Let's say you have a group of five people that e-m=
ail back and forth regularly. But now they have the opportunity for a half-=
hour Internet meeting. That single video face-to-face eats the same equival=
ent bandwidth of one year's worth of their e-mails!  Now let's say they lov=

g to being there?and it's DIRT-CHEAP-airtime is free-as well.  What industr=
y-which company-will benefit most from this soaring demand? To answer that =
question, I need to tell you about one of the biggest secrets in technology=
 today. Call it a misconception, if you will.   I call it a bald-faced lie-=
one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportuni=
ty of immense proportions. I'm talking about the so-called "glut" of fiber =
optic cable.  As I've been telling my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers, I belie=
ve the build-out has really just begun. In fact, I can prove it. And compan=
ies that make the fiber are tremendous long-term investments.  But right no=
w, I want to fill you in on just one aspect of the fiber business that will=
 make you quite rich, a whole lot quicker.  Here's the deal: Yes, there is =
a large amount of unutilized fiber optic cable out there today. But that's =
not a problem for the tech industry. It's an opportunity.   You see, 95% of=
 all the fiber that has ever been laid is "dark"-that is, it's not activate=
d. At a recent investment conference, I explained it like this: "You know w=
hat dark fiber has in common with a bushel of wheat? You can't send data ov=
er either one of them."  Before this fiber can be used, it has to be "lit."=
 Who do you call to do the job? You call Nortel, you call Cisco, you call L=
ucent. Then they all call ONE COMPANY to get the parts. THAT'S the stock I =
want you to buy now.  Low Risk With Ten-Bagger Potential  I'm looking at a =
double-possibly a triple-by this time next year!   And I fully expect to mu=
ltiply our money 10-times over by 2007. Best of all, this stock is so beate=
n-down, there's little risk from here. Point is, if I'm right-and I'll glad=
ly stake my reputation on this call-just a small investment now can make yo=
u a huge pile of cash. The stock? None other than optical powerhouse JDS Un=
iphase (NASDAQ: JDSU).  Here's my reasoning:  When the World Trade Center g=
ot hit, the Internet slowed down-very noticeably slowed down. What does tha=
t mean? There isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to =
accommodate a blip in demand.  I believe people in government are very worr=
ied about this problem. After all, this is the second time it's happened. B=
ack in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for =
two full days because an optical cable got caught in the snare.  That means=
 our communications systems-and therefore our economy-are very, very vulner=
able.  Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered. But today, commerce and se=
curity is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems. Virtually nothing moves wi=
thout it. That's how banks and brokerages transfer funds?how dispatchers ro=
ute fleets of trucks?how many Americans get paid through direct deposit.  A=
nd we are closer to the breaking point than 99.9% of Americans even begin t=
o understand. Here's one example.  Qwest-one of America's biggest carriers-=
recently said they're 63% loaded on their network. That doesn't sound too b=
ad?until you understand how these networks operate. You can't load a networ=
k much past 65%. In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic-because the network=
 spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any time=
 actually sending packets of information.  The system locks. Communications=
 stops. The nation comes to a standstill. Quite simply, America is falling =
behind the rest of the developed world, and we've got to catch up fast!  In=
ternet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia, Europe and even S=
outh America. That's because we push out more data than everyone else-but w=
e're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.  Get this-da=
ta traffic is DOUBLING every year now. That means a network running at 63% =
of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to keep up=
. That's why the fiber must-and will-be lit. Otherwise business, the econom=
y and our national security are all in the crapper.  So how does a smart in=
vestor profit? As I mentioned, the Big 3 systems manufacturers (Nortel, Cis=
co and Lucent) handle the contracts. But they're all in tough competition w=
ith one another. I prefer JDSU, which gives these guys the TOOLS they need =
to do the job.  There's very little credible competition at that end. If yo=
u want reliability, great service and appealing cost structures, it's the O=
NLY place to turn.  At the height of the boom, JDS Uniphase's stock was nea=
rly 20-times higher. What changed? Spending on communications networks drie=
d up. Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spendin=
g into the economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need isn't=
 just vital for the economy anymore-it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  =
That's why I'm so sure of the immense opportunity ahead if you invest in JD=
SU today. What's more (here's the best part!) this is NOT the only fiber op=
