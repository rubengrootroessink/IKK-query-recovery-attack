I wonder is she's related to Linda.....

(Linda Hendersen is a lady that lives in Elkhart Texas and leases from
Bat's father in law.  She not only shoots quality deer year in and year
out, but she even shot someone's beagle and called the number on the dead
dog's tags to complain that her morning hunt had been messed up.)
