Subject: RiverMarket Public Meeting and Ballot for the Election
The ballot listed below lists the 13 propostions on the February 2 ballot and
the gentlemen running for City Council.  Proposition 1 has to do with the new
pool.

I attended the meeting about the proposed pool tonight and it was quite
interesting.   It is not my place to be political.  My job is to keep you
informed.  Therefore, let me say one word -- VOTE.  I hope that we will be
informed voters and that we will be an area of League City that will exercise
our right to vote.  As we ask for things from the city and the school
district it helps to let them know that we are an active group of voters in
CCV.  Remember, if you do not vote, you cannot complain later.  :)  Thank you
to everyone from CCV who attended the meeting tonight.  We were a large
protion of the group.  Mary G. Strickland


A Public Meeting for the proposed League City RiverMarket will be held on
Monday, January 14,2002, 6:30pm at the Johnnie Arolfo Civic Center in League
City.
Consultants have been hired to create a master plan for a mixed use project
along the south side of Clear Creek from Interstate 45 to FM 270.  Mape,
drawings and photos depicting various features of the project will be
presented for public comment.
