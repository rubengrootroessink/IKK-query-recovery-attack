 has been a difficult year for many investors, as stock prices have plummet=
ed from news of war, poor company earnings estimates and increasing corpora=
te layoffs.   But some stocks (and some investors) are actually posting hug=
e gains this year!   Subscribers to David Fried's The Buyback Letter  are e=
arning stellar profits for the year, as the 5-stock High Tech Portfolio has=
 gained an incredible +39.23% YTD(+9.61 in November alone), while his Stock=
 Pickers Portfolio is up over 31% for the year. By contrast, The Nasdaq los=
t 21% of its value over the same time frame.   Fried's other portfolios hav=
e hit their stride in November, as the Buyback Dogs Portfolio earned an imp=
ressive +14.57% for the month, his 20-Stock Buyback Index gained +6.11%, an=
d his Buyback Income Index shot up +5.61%  And these profits are not uncomm=
on for Fried, whose 5-year performance has earned him the coveted #1 rankin=
g by newsletter watchdog Hulbert Financial Digest.Since inception, Fried's =
Stockpickers Portfolio has gained 146% (vs. only +84% for the S&P 500.)  In=
 addition, his 5-stock Buyback Dogs portfolio is up 104.93% since inception=
 vs. +42% for the S&P 500 over the same time frame. 19 of Fried's last 22 t=
rades have been profitable, with an average profit of 179%!       A Huge Pr=
ofit Opportunity For Today's Buyback Investors?   Right now may be the best=
 time for investors to get back into the market, as a potentially  huge buy=
ing opportunity has emerged for buyback investors who act immediately:    "=
Investors who focus on stock buybacks have a serious advantage in the curre=
nt market," Fried says. "Recent moves by the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion have made it easier for companies to buy back their stock while share =
prices are at their weakest. This ultimately creates higher earnings per sh=
are and, therefore, stronger share prices."  In the current issue of The Bu=
yback Letter (available FREE for 30 days from INVESTools ), Fried lists his=
 new "Best Buy" stocks that represent your best value right now. Insiders i=

rage Buyback Value Stock  Outperforms The Market By 45.3%:  The New York Ti=
mes  reports that a study of all U.S. stocks from 1980-1990 found  that the=
 stock of an average company announcing a repurchase plan will  beat the  m=
arket decisively (12.1% for the average company, 45.3% for a value stock) i=
n  the four years following the repurchase announcement.  This makes sense.=
 After all, when a company buys back their own stock, it's  an  enormous vo=
te of confidence  by those who know it best - senior executives. No  one el=
se knows the firm's financial situation, market share, business plans,  com=
petitive advantages and new product strategies better than those with  hand=
s-on, day-to-day experience.  But, these executives aren't talking. They ke=
ep their plans, tactics, and  research behind closed doors.  The only indic=
ator of their well-founded optimism  is a stock buyback. It's a powerful in=
dicator that no serious investor should  ignore.   Just how powerful are bu=
yback stocks? In the last 10 years if you had invested  $10,000 in a typica=
l S&P 500 portfolio, you investment would have grown to  $67,917 - an excel=

tocks would have grown to $130,254 - nearly $70,000 more in profits!   The =
