Julie Seay asked that we let you know about this missing cat.  Thanks for any
help that you can give us.  Mary G. Strickland

Mary Johnson has lost her orange and white cat this week when it ran away
because of the commotion caused by roofers at her house.  She is at 1911
Aggie.  Can people please look out for this type of cat that may be hiding
in their shrubs or under something such as decking?  Especially those who
live on Aggie and Acacia, which is behind Ms. Johnson's house, should be on
the look out for this lost cat.  Thanks.

Julie
