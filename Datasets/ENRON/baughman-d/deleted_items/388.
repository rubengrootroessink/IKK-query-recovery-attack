I still have a job.....they are working on a deal to sell the Power & Gas Trading desk to a big financial company.  We will see, we should know in a few days.   Are you coming in this weekend for Scotty's Christmas party?

Hope to see you soon.

Don,

Just wanted to see how the deer hunting went and how Turkey day was for you.

How are things at Enron - are you secure or walking on egg shells?

Talk to you later!

Joe
