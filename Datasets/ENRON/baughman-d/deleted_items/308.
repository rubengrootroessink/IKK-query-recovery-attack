> 1. WON'T BEAT ME UP
> 2. WON'T RUN AWAY
> 3. HAS TO BE GREAT IN BED

> For several months, her phone rang off the hook, her doorbell rang

> seemed to meet her qualifications.
>
> Then one day the doorbell rang yet again. She opened the door to find a
man

> "Who are you and what do you want?"
>
> "Hi," said the man "Your search is over, for I am the man of your dreams.
> I've got no arms, so I can't beat you up and I've got no legs, so I can't
run

> The old woman asked, "What makes you think you're so great in bed?"
>
> To which he replied, "I rang the doorbell, didn't I?"
