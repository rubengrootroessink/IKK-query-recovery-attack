Dear Investor,

So far you've missed 69% gains.  Wait any longer, and you'll miss the
best shot at a ten-bagger you'll ever get!

A while back I wrote to you about what I call "the biggest lie in
technology today"...

...and offered you a FREE bulletin on the ONE stock best positioned for
enormous gains, as this story unfolds.  A stock that could easily DOUBLE
your money in short order...and then make your fortune several times
over in the next few years.

To me, it's CRAZY that I haven't heard back from you.  After all, this
is an entirely FREE piece of information--with no obligation on your
part.  You have nothing to lose.  And--judging by our gains so far--a
pile of money to make.

Since I started pounding the table for this stock after the September
crisis, it's UP 69%!  But DON'T WORRY.  There's still time to get in on
the lion's share of the gains.  The really BIG PROFITS--3 or 4-times
what we've made so far--will come as the economy recovers this year.
And that's why the perfect time to buy this POWERHOUSE company is NOW.

IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this stock,
complete details and my full "buy instructions"--absolutely FREE,
without obligation of any kind.

But first, it's imperative that you know the truth about technology's
biggest lie: The so-called "glut" of fiber optic cable.

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down--very
noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!
That means there isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the
system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.
After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, a
tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems--and therefore our economy--are
very, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than
99.9% of Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said they're 60%
loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until you
understand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network much
past 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic--because the network
spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to a
standstill.  And business, the economy and our national security all go
in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber glut?"  Because
 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is "dark"--that is, it's
not activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of
the components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--possibly
a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our
money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
"ten-bagger" potential!

So get in on the action.  Click on the link below to get the name of
this stock--This TOP PICK is absolutely FREE and without obligation, but
only for a limited time.  It's my way of introducing you to my
award-winning Technology Investing advisory--but there's no obligation
of any kind.

I think you'll find this FREE offer well worth your while.  In 1999--the
last time tech stocks started from such depressed levels--my clients
earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert Financial Digest.  And that
earned us Hulbert's #1 RANKING for all investment advisories!

So far, we've made 69% in this fiber-optics POWERHOUSE since
mid-September.  You've missed out so far.  Don't miss out on the much
BIGGER GAINS to come,

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-times
higher.  But then the economy tanked and spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in
emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically
zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's a
question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why this next move up will be so
powerful.

Please don't miss out.

You've got nothing to lose by taking advantage of this FREE--no strings
attached--introductory offer.  Click here to sign up now:

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.  This
"ten-bagger" has a long ways to run--but it's already UP 69% since
mid-September, in recognition of this company's vital new role in
national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained to the
limits.  And get this--data traffic is DOUBLING every year now.  That
means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to take advantage of this
FREE opportunity now.
