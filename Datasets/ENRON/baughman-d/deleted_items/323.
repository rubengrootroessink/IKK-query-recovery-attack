 Technology Today      Microsoft's new operating system, Windows XP, was re=

est. That's what I want to tell you about today.   You see, Windows XP tran=
sforms the Internet into a poor-man's version of the virtual private networ=

 the operating system couldn't handle all the complexities of doing Interne=
t videoconferences.   Well, now it finally can. All it takes is a $100 came=
ra?a couple of speakers?and a phone line. You can share a spreadsheet, a wh=

 meeting without ever leaving your desk. It's PERFECT for the home office. =
A fantastic face-to-face sales tool. Heck, we're installing the cameras all=
 over the place at my offices for immediate feedback-something that's of cr=
itical importance in the money management world.   In short, the point I'm =
trying to make is that video Internet meetings finally really work-for the =
first time-thanks to Microsoft XP. And I know from experience, there's a hu=
ge PENT-UP DEMAND. What's more, the recent terrorist events will only incre=
ase the desire for virtual face-to-face meetings, instead of actual travel.=
  Now Let Me Show You What All That Demand Does to Capacity...and How You C=

e-mail back and forth regularly. But now they have the opportunity for a ha=

stry-which company-will benefit most from this soaring demand? To answer th=
at question, I need to tell you about one of the biggest secrets in technol=
ogy today. Call it a misconception, if you will.   I call it a bald-faced l=
ie-one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opport=
unity of immense proportions. I'm talking about the so-called "glut" of fib=
er optic cable.  As I've been telling my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers, I be=
lieve the build-out has really just begun. In fact, I can prove it. And com=
panies that make the fiber are tremendous long-term investments.  But right=
 now, I want to fill you in on just one aspect of the fiber business that w=
ill make you quite rich, a whole lot quicker.  Here's the deal. Yes, there =
is a large amount of unutilized fiber optic cable out there today. But that=
's not a problem for the tech industry. It's an opportunity.   You see, 95%=
 of all the fiber that has ever been laid is "dark"-that is, it's not activ=
ated. At a recent investment conference, I explained it like this: "You kno=
w what dark fiber has in common with a bushel of wheat? You can't send data=
 over either one of them."  Before this fiber can be used, it has to be "li=
t." Who do you call to do the job? You call Nortel, you call Cisco, you cal=
l Lucent. Then they all call ONE COMPANY to get the parts. THAT'S the stock=
 I want you to buy now.  Low Risk With Ten-Bagger Potential  I'm looking at=
 a double-possibly a triple-by this time next year!   And I fully expect to=
 multiply our money ten-times over by 2007. Best of all, this stock is so b=
eaten-down, there's little risk from here. Point is, if I'm right-and I'll =
gladly stake my reputation on this call-just a small investment now can mak=
e you a huge pile of cash. The stock? None other than optical powerhouse JD=
S Uniphase (NASDAQ: JDSU).  Here's my reasoning:  When the World Trade Cent=
er got hit, the Internet slowed down-very noticeably slowed down. What does=
 that mean? There isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the system=
 to accommodate a blip in demand.  I believe people in government are very =
worried about this problem. After all, this is the second time it's happene=
d. Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl =
for two full days because an optical cable got caught in the snare.  That m=
eans our communications systems-and therefore our economy-are very, very vu=
lnerable.  Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered. But today, commerce an=
d security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems. Virtually nothing move=
s without it. That's how banks and brokerages transfer funds?how dispatcher=
s route fleets of trucks?how many Americans get paid through direct deposit=
.  And we are closer to the breaking point than 99.9% of Americans even beg=
in to understand. Here's one example:  Qwest-one of America's biggest carri=
ers-recently said they're 63% loaded on their network. That doesn't sound t=
oo bad?until you understand how these networks operate. You can't load a ne=
twork much past 65%. In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic-because the net=
work spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any =
time actually sending packets of information.  The system locks. Communicat=
ions stops. The nation comes to a standstill. Quite simply, America is fall=
ing behind the rest of the developed world, and we've got to catch up fast!=
  Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia, Europe and ev=
en South America. That's because we push out more data than everyone else-b=
ut we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.  Get thi=
s-data traffic is DOUBLING every year now. That means a network running at =
63% of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to kee=
p up. That's why the fiber must-and will-be lit. Otherwise business, the ec=
onomy and our national security are all in the crapper.  So how does a smar=
t investor profit? As I mentioned, the Big 3 systems manufacturers (Nortel,=
 Cisco and Lucent) handle the contracts. But they're all in tough competiti=
on with one another. I prefer JDSU, which gives these guys the TOOLS they n=
eed to do the job.  There's very little credible competition at that end. I=
f you want reliability, great service and appealing cost structures, it's t=
he ONLY place to turn.  At the height of the boom, JDS Uniphase's stock was=
 nearly 20-times higher. What changed? Spending on communications networks =
dried up. Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spe=
nding into the economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need i=
sn't just vital for the economy anymore-it's a question of NATIONAL SECURIT=
Y!  That's why I'm so sure of the immense opportunity ahead if you invest i=
n JDSU today. What's more (here's the best part!) this is NOT the only fibe=
