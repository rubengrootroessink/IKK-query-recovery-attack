Hi Don -
 
I am heading over to be part of the Estate (and hence leaving the 6th floor).
 
Wanted to send you my contact info as we all drift off in new directions.
 
My outside email is bobbygerry@hotmail.com <mailto:bobbygerry@hotmail.com>
 
Drop me your contact info and we'll stay in touch.
 
Bobby
