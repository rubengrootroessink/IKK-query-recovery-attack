NO SURRENDER, YET

Al-Qaeda fighters holed up in the Tora Bora area of AFGHANISTAN showed
no sign of surrender, despite punishing American bombing. A new deal
was offered to al-Qaeda diehards: surrender Osama bin Laden and his
close comrades and go free. Some thought Mr bin Laden had fled to
Pakistan.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36746_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

France said it was ready to commit troops to a multinational
PEACEKEEPING FORCE in Afghanistan. Britain was set to lead it, although
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, said that many details still had
to be resolved.

A Somali militia leader alleged that the al-Qaeda terrorist network was
moving its operations to SOMALIA, a mostly Muslim country in a state of
chaos. American officials said that they were investigating, but played
down the possibility that military strikes were imminent.

John Ashcroft, America's attorney-general, charged a Moroccan-born
Frenchman with conspiring with al-Qaeda to carry out the SEPTEMBER 11TH
TERRORIST ATTACKS. Zacarias Moussaoui, who had undertaken pilot
training in Minnesota, could face trial by a secret military tribunal.

VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

Israel ended all direct contact with YASSER ARAFAT and struck at
Palestinian police stations and other targets after ten Israelis in a
bus had been killed by gunmen near a Jewish settlement in the West
Bank. A Fatah militia group and Hamas both claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying that it was in revenge for recent killings of
Palestinians by Israel's forces. Mr Arafat moved to close down all
Hamas and Islamic Jihad offices.

SAUDI ARABIA'S interior minister, Prince Nayef, announced that for the
first time identity cards, carrying photographs of their unveiled
faces, would be issued to Saudi women under certain conditions.
Hitherto, a woman has been named only as a dependant on the card of her
father or husband.

Ruud Lubbers, the UN high commissioner for REFUGEES, accused
governments of basing their policies towards the world's 22m refugees
on "fear and mistrust".

Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, announced that a long-awaited
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION will be held in March.

YESTERDAY'S TREATY

President George Bush said he would give Russia notice that America
will withdraw from the 1972 ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TREATY. Mr Bush said
the treaty was written in a "different era for a different enemy".

A presidential commission unanimously backed three recommendations that
would allow young workers to invest part of their SOCIAL SECURITY
contributions in the stockmarket. The decision came as concerns grew
over financing the retirement years of the baby-boom generation. The
chances of action seem slim.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36743_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6a

Police in Los Angeles arrested two leaders of the JEWISH DEFENCE LEAGUE
on charges of trying to blow up a mosque and the office of an
Arab-American congressman.

ITALY RETREATS

Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, gave way to his EU partners
and accepted plans for an EU-WIDE ARREST WARRANT. Italy had objected to
the long list of crimes it would cover. Changes in the Italian
constitution will be needed. Mr Berlusconi's Northern League allies
were dismayed, both by the warrant itself (too much foreign meddling)
and by his readiness to yield to EU pressure.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36742_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

In advance of an EU SUMMIT at Laeken, in Belgium, the president of the
European Commission, Romano Prodi, attacked members for agreeing to
plans but then not carrying them out (eg, the proposed "Galileo"
European global-positioning system). EU summits might become mere
high-level talking-shops, he suggested. Become? jeered cynics.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36747_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

In BRITAIN, dispute arose over urgings by David Blunkett, the home
secretary, that immigrants should do more to adapt to British ways, and
over a report on some race riots earlier this year, which lamented that
brown and white communities live almost entirely apart. He proposed
more emphasis on the use of English, and a new oath of allegiance for
people seeking naturalisation.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36750_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_68

An international tribunal in The Hague indicted SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC for
genocide during the early-1990s civil war in Bosnia. The former
Yugoslav dictator refused to plead, calling the charge a "monstrous
absurdity".

Fourteen British and Dutch plane-spotters who had been held in prison
in GREECE on charges of spying were offered bail.

KILLING IN INDIA

Five gunmen broke into INDIA'S parliament buildings. In the ensuing
battle, they and at least six other people including policemen, though
no MPs, were killed.

One week after a new government was elected in SRI LANKA, bringing the
prospect of peace talks with the separatist Tamil Tigers, the rebels
attacked a police station and an army post killing ten people. Six
Tigers were reported to have been killed.

Nine hereditary rulers of MALAYSIA chose Syed Sirajuddin, the ruler of
Perlis state, as the country's new king for the traditional term of
five years.

Tung Chee-hwa, picked by China to run the former British colony of HONG
KONG, is to run for a second five-year term.

Jiang Zemin became the first Chinese head of state to visit MYANMAR
since the military junta seized power in 1988. China supplies Myanmar
with most of its arms.

CHEESED OFF WITH CHAVEZ

VENEZUELA came to a standstill in a one-day stoppage organised by
private business and backed by labour in protest at decrees issued by
President Hugo Chavez. The president threatened to "turn the screws" on
the opposition.

ARGENTINA limped on. Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, said he
would keep his promise to the IMF of a balanced budget next year by
scrapping earlier tax cuts.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO'S second general election in a year failed to break
a political deadlock. The government and opposition each won 18 seats.
The rival leaders held talks on a possible coalition.
