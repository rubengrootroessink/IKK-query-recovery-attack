Dear Investor,

I know you're frustrated by the lousy market over the past 18 months.
But I warn you...

...now is not the time to start taking big risks in hope of making up
for lost time.  You'll just end up in a bigger hole. And frankly, it
just isn't necessary to take chances to achieve great profits.  There is
a much better, time-tested way.

YOU CAN become an "Armadillo Investor."

The armadillo is nature's perfect survivor.  A thick plate of armor.
Sharp claws.  And a clear focus on the hunt.  Armadillo Investors build
profits aggressively -- but we also use proven techniques to protect
against the losses most investors inevitably suffer.  Our mantra: "Win
at investing by never losing."

I don't take big risks when hunting for oversized profits.  I simply
follow the armadillo strategy that has made me wealthy -- and made
thousands of investors who've followed my advice quite wealthy, as well.
 Here's just one example of an Armadillo stock we're recommending today
-- I think you'll see why it's the kind of investment EVERY investor
should own.

This company has achieved 31 consecutive years of revenue growth!  It's
gained 72% for us so far this year.  That sounds like heaven, compared
to the hell most investors have been sliding through.

I came upon this story in an afternoon of serendipity.  Debbie and I
were out riding our Harleys on a beautiful fall day when we passed an
impressive-sized store in South Deerfield, Massachusetts.  While that's
not exactly the middle-of-nowhere, it's close.  And the huge parking lot
was JAMMED with hundreds of cars.

At first, I thought it must be a mall.  Curiosity got the best of us, so
we stopped for a peek.  No mall.  Just a single store, selling just one
product line, with folks lined up at the registers ten-deep!  Okay, this
was something worth checking out, so I put my research team on it.

It turns out that this store is the second most-visited tourist
destination in Massachusetts.  And it's the front for one of the
most-amazing little companies I've ever run across -- devoted followers,
fat profit margins and some heavy hitters behind the scenes.  Directors
include Hollywood deal man Michael Ovitz, the president of Staples and
the chairman of J. Crew.  This is just a neat story that can make you a
lot of money.

I outline the best ways to profit from this Armadillo and 4 more in my
new FREE report: ARMADILLO STOCKS: 5 INVESTMENTS THAT WIN BY NEVER
LOSING. This new report is yours absolutely FREE for the asking.
Nothing to buy.  Nothing to try.  No cost.  No commitment.  No kidding.

Just read it and profit.

Why am I giving this report away FREE?  Because it's the best way I know
to introduce you to my advisory service.

Each month in INTELLIGENCE REPORT we outline the profit champions of
tomorrow.  We call them "armadillo stocks" because they have sharp claws
to rake in fat profits and a hard shell for protection from competitors
and recession.
