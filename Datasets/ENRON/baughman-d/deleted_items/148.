Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, on his way home from work

 at City Hall, came to a dead halt in traffic on the Dan

 Ryan Expressway and thought to himself, "Wow, this traffic

 seems worse than usual. Nothing's moving at all."



 He noticed a State Trooper walking back and forth between

 the lines of cars, so he rolled down his window and asked,

 "Officer, I'm Mayor Richard M. Daley, what's the problem;

 what's holding everything up."



 The trooper replied, "It's the Reverend Jackson.  He's so

 depressed about the thought of everyone knowing about his

 extra-martial affair and his illegitimate child, that he

 stopped his car in the middle of the Dan Ryan Expressway

 and is threatening to douse himself with gasoline and set

 himself on fire. He says the country and his congregation

 are blaming him for his infidelity and doesn't know if he

 can live with the shame and embarrassment.  The people in

 the halted cars along the expressway are taking up a

 collection for him."



 "Oh really," replied Mayor Daley. "How much have they

 collected for the Reverend Jackson so far?"



 "About 300 gallons," said the trooper, "but they are still

 siphoning"
