We use to have ads in the bulletin about kids who would pet sit for neighbors
when ethey were away.  I have residents on the west side of the village who
need someone to come over and check on her cat, house, get mail, etc when
they have to leave town.  They could have to leave on short notice and would
probably not be gone for more than a week.  Any suggestions or volunteers?
Let me know and I will connect you with them.  Mary G. Strickland
