Subject:	Fw: is this our world


G. Bush and C. Powell are sitting in a bar. A guy walks in and asks the
barman, "Isn't that Bush and Powell?" The barman says, "Yep, that's them."
So the guy walks over and says, "Hello, what are you guys doing?" Bush says,
"We're planning world war 3" The guy says, "Really? What's going to happen?"
Bush says, "Well, we're going to kill 10 million Afghans and one bicycle
repairman."  The guy exclaimed, "Why are you gonna kill a bicycle
repairman?!!!" So Bush turns to Powell and says, "See, I told you no one
would worry about the 10 million Afghans""
