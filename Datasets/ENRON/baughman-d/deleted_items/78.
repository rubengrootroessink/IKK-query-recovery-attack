Dear Mary,
       I have some really exciting news to share with you and the residents
of Clear Creek Village, and hope you will include this in your next email.
       The City has been successful in being awarded yet ANOTHER GRANT to
purchase park land in League City.  And this purchase will positively
affect/protect your homeowners.
       Thanks to the tireless efforts, dedication and vision of Rhonda Cyrus,
Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the City of League City has been
awarded $500,000 from the CIAP (Coastal Impact Assistance Program) to
purchase 51.4 acres from Kenneth Erickson, land that is adjacent to Clear
Creek Village.
       I know you and others will be glad that the land will not be developed
or subdivided.
       Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
Barbara Meeks
