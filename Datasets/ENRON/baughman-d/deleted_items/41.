A fun-filled bachelor party at a strip club called the Pretty Kitty
turned deadly recently when a 32-year-old groom-to-be who was enjoying
the attentions of a well-endowed stripper suffocated while his face was
buried in her 72-DD breasts. According to investigators, the man was
enjoying a lap dance from a stripper named Kandy Kane when disaster
struck. She began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his
face. The more she shook, the deeper the man got lost in her cleavage.
Before long, his friends noticed he was no longer moving. The man's
family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.
