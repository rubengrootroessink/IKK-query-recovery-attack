Thought this one was worth forwarding...Hope all is well...Tre 
This was on the editorial page on Sunday, October 28, 2001 of the Denton 
Record Chronicle (by Dwight Crawford Sr., Sanger, Tx) 
The Immunity of Texas 
I get a big laugh at the dialogue of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, 
politicians, and the news media. They say terrorists will hit us again in 
the oncoming weeks and months. What a joke! You have a better chance of 
getting killed on Interstate 35 E than by a terrorist. 
Osama has probably seen 100 degree plus summers in Afghanistan, but he 
doesn't have fire ants to go with it. If he did he wouldn't be sleeping on 
the ground in his cave. He talks of pain and suffering he is going to 
inflict on us. He doesn't know what pain is, until he gets kicked by a green 
broke, two-year-old colt in freezing rain. Germ war fare? Texas ticks will 
give you Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme disease, Blister Beetles kill 
your horse, Green Bugs destroy a wheat crop, and termites eat your house. 
Anthrax has killed Texas cattle for over 125 years. So, what's new? 
Our prairie dogs carry the plague, armadillos harbor leprosy, and our bats 
and skunks threaten rabies. We have rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water 
moccasins. Ho hum. 
They talk of gas and biological warfare. They have never pulled in behind a 
cattle truck while its raining, or ridden in the front seat of a pickup 
between two cowboys, after they just eaten a big bowl of Texas Red. 
Texas ain't for sissies! We have posted signs all over the state that says, 
"Don't mess with Texas!" Osama, consider yourself warned!
