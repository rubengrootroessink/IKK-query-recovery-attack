Don...  Chuck  updated me on the status of our discussions re. trading and creating a  TradersNews Energy product on EOL.
 
I fully understand  that corporately, you have a lot on your plate right now and we will be  patient.  I would like to meet with you in a few weeks when the dust  settles a bit.
 
I do have a one  quick question....  My sources indicate that Enron has agreed to place a  Megawatt-Daily Cinergy Hourly product on EOL within 2 weeks.  Is this a  true statement?
 
Please RSVP  ....  Thanks
