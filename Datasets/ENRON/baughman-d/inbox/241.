This is a message from Rusty Tidwell.  mgs
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas.

My son, Marcus, and I would like to help out anyone who may need some
assistance in taking down their Christmas lights/decorations or straightening
up afterwards. I realize we have several elderly residents along with people
being "under the weather."

We would be glad to help, just give us call.

Happy New Years To All,

Russ Tidwell
