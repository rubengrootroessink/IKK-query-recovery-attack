An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba (MHEB) has been signed =
and begins tomorrow, November 1st.  In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we=
 need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB=
 may frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savin=
gs with MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices=
/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc=
. I realize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much =
business with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are w=
orking on other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this de=
al will affect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate =
information with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, plea=
se maintain the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Man=
itoba/MHEB Price Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hour=
ly and next day, record any relevant market information (see the log for ex=
amples). Include responsibility for handling MHEB in the daily transition t=
o the night shift.  Dean will coordinate these efforts. Please call me (cel=
l - 713-962-0526) with any questions.  Thank you!=20
