We are currently receiving a number of resumes from Enron.  These resumes
are very welcome as we have a number of positions we are trying to fill.
If you know anyone from Enron who is currently seeking employment, please
have them forward their resume via e-mail to ahoge@cmsenergy.com and state
what type of position they'd be interested in.  This will enable us to sort
through the e-mails most efficiently.  If you know any good potential
candidates from Enron, please get the word out that we are looking to fill
a number of positions and encourage them to send their resumes.  Remember,
anyone you forward should be someone you would be willing to recommend as a
"good hire" to the company.  Thanks, -Alyce
