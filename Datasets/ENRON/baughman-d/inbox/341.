Dear Investor,

About 3 weeks ago, I e-mailed you about a stock I
believe can make you filthy rich.

So far, I haven't heard back from you, and that's a
real shame.  That's because we don't get many chances
like this one -- where a small investment now can
create true wealth in just a couple short years.

Think I'm kidding?  This company just issued a small
piece of good news yesterday, and its stock POPPED
27%.  Now today, it's up another 12% at mid-day.
That's 39% GAINS in 9 1/2 trading hours!  When's the
last time you made profits like that?

Best of all, those gains are just the appetizer for
the feast to follow.  So it's not too late for you --
if you get in now.  So what's the story?  And why is
it so powerful?

Well, my friend, this company's revolutionary
communications breakthrough makes Federal Express look
like the Pony Express...and could well make you 500%
RICHER by 2003.

I'm talking of a global network to deliver documents,
data, video on-demand -- anything you can imagine --
anywhere in the world...at the SPEED OF LIGHT!  Yet the
company behind this remarkable achievement -- a GEM
rich in innovation and cash -- is priced at giveaway
prices thanks to the market meltdown.

This ISN'T some punk Internet stock struggling to stay
afloat.  The company has a $2.4 BILLION cash war chest
and a list of PAYING CLIENTS that reads like the
"who's who" of global communications.  I've been
professionally involved in global stock markets for 30
years now, and I can honestly say I've seldom seen a
story so dramatic.

*At my California Technology Stock Letter, we jumped
on Intel in 1994, when most analysts scoffed at its
prospects.  Three years later, we sold for 575% GAINS.

*In July 1998, Power Integrations got knocked down to
silly levels, so I practically screamed at clients to,
"BUY!"  We better than tripled our money in less than
six months' time.

*DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in 1998 when
we gobbled up all we could.  Our 1,316% gains turned
$25,000 into more than $350,000.

THERE ARE MORE LIKE THESE.  But they don't come around
every day.  That's why I'm pounding the table on this
one.  I'm expecting some of the EASIEST PROFITS we've
ever made.  And if you MISS OUT, you'll kick yourself
later.

I've just put the finishing touches on an URGENT
Profit Bulletin called You Can Be 500% Richer By 2003
that I'd like you to have.  It details the saga of the
#1 TOP-DOG in global communications today...explains why
this company will dominate worldwide while others
fail...and gives you hard evidence for 500% PROFITS by
2003.

And that's just to start.  There's a great shot at
TENFOLD GAINS in the next 5 years, because this
company truly controls the destiny of global
communications.

THE FUTURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS FIBER OPTICS.  Think
of nearly unlimited bandwidth at incredibly efficient
prices.  Experience and research tells me, this is an
industry destined for greatness.    Ask yourself this:
Will we go back to rotary phones, no Internet and
scratchy long-distance calls?  Or will we go forward
to faster connections... Internet use throughout the
world...and a wide array of data, video, conferencing,
etc, services?

My friend, man simply DOESN'T go backwards.  It's
human nature to want what your neighbor has.  It's
human nature to want bigger, better and more.  That's
why I believe the communications revolution isn't
over...it's JUST GETTING STARTED.  There will be bumps,
bruises and shakeouts along the way.  But that just
allows KINGPIN companies like this one to gobble up
even more market share.

THIS COMPANY INVESTED more than $7 billion to link 27
companies with a revolutionary 100,000-mile fiber
optic network.  And in a real twist in today's world,
the project just finished on budget...on schedule.
What's more, this network isn't some empty shell -- it
has real paying customers, with contracts covering
half the cost already.

*Its customers already include major telecoms like
Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom and Qwest;
institutions like the British government and the U.S.
Navy; and companies like Proctor & Gamble, American
Express, Direct TV and JP Morgan Chase.  And the
company has already inked $1 billion worth of new
deals so far this year.

*China is becoming a huge source of profits.  The
country has pledged to spend $13 billion to improve
its infrastructure in preparation for the 2008
Olympics -- much of that for communications upgrades.
What's more, China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will trigger another spending spree.  And
this company will be one of the prime beneficiaries.
As you'll see in your free report, the China
connection is HUGE!

*This company has been on an earnings tear, prior to
the hit our entire economy  has taken this fall.
EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes, depreciation
and amortization) rose 33% in the 2nd quarter -- a
phenomenal number.  And as the economy recovers, I
expect EBITDA to return to its blistering growth pace.

*What's more, this company is set to be a big player
in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that enable SECURE
communications between groups of people anywhere in
the world.  Virtual "face-to-face" audio and video.
No need for airline travel.  Analysts expect this
industry to grow quickly and become huge.

THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS in the bandwidth
game.  And I'll bet dollars to doughnuts, this company
will be the BIGGEST WINNER of all.   In today's weak
economy, the smaller outfits are teetering on the
edge.  They can't raise capital.  But in the meantime,
this JUGGERNAUT is sitting on $2.4 BILLION in cash!

I sense AMAZING OPPORTUNITY here.  But the opportunity
won't last long.  Today's confusion about the economy
has some real gems priced like baubles.  And this
stock is a GLITTERING DIAMOND just waiting for you to
scoop it up.

Editor, California Technology Stock Letter

P.S.  Bill Gates is one smart guy -- and Microsoft
recently inked a new deal with this company to link
all its European offices.  Why?  Because it's the only
place to turn for state-of-the-art technology and
service.  You must understand, no other firm can match
this company's technologies or global reach.  And I
don't believe we'll ever see this stock priced so low
again -- even after its 27% GAINS today.  Grab YOUR
SHARE of the profits ahead.  Click here now:
