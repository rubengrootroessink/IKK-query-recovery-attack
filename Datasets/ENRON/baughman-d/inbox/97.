> She said, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm

> With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and yelled,
> "Mama needs new clothes!"
>
> Then she hollered..."YES! YES! I WON! I WON!"  She jumped up and  down and
> hugged each of the dealers.
>
> She then picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed.
>
> The dealers just stared at each other dumbfounded.
>
> Finally, one of them asked, "What did she roll?"

> The other answered, "I don't know,  I thought YOU were watching!"
