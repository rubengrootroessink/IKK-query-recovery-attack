Dale,

I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See my notes below:

M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info 
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Studies	

The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We will not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your organization will need the information.  

Please let me know if you need me to check others for you.  

Thanks. 

Debra
