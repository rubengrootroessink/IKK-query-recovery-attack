Gentlemen,

I have contacted the DBAs and indicated your displeasure of not being informed of the proposed EnPower down-time.  They should be contacting you shortly.  However, let me ensure you that there will be no down time without your approval.  Attached is the email that I sent in response to Bill's call earlier this afternoon.  Don, I have included you in this email to keep Real-Time East "in the loop".

 

Regards,
Will

DBAs,

What exactly are your plans for this maintenance window?  I have just receive a very stern call from our Bill Williams (head of the West Desk real-time traders) whom is concerned that his team will be unable to function for 8 hours for days in a row.  He indicated that the database being down for that period of time is unacceptable.  Our real-time users work 24-7 and must meet schedules every hour.

Bill also asked that we keep the real-time desk in the loop for any potential down time.
Please include the following people on your distribution list regarding database maintenance windows.
Don Baughman (head of Real-Time East)
Bill Williams III (head of Real-Time West)
Michael Tully (IT Portland)

All scheduled down-times must be approved by both Don Baughman and Bill Williams.  This would indicate that we need to plan in advance in all cases so that they have time to approve.

Please distribute a new email discussing in more detail the state of the database during the maintenance window.

Thanks,
Will

Will/Bill/Norman,

The DBAs would like some downtime this weekend to re-build some objects that are overly-fragmented.  If we can give them 2 - 4 different 6 - 12 hour windows, they will re-build as much as they can.

Can we get together briefly this morning to determine when we could allow some downtime?  The DBAs would like to know by about 2:00 this afternoon.

Thanks, d.n.
