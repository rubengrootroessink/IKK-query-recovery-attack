 [IMAGE]    INVESTMENT  SUMMARY    HYPD is a premier provider of comprehens=
ive integrated technology services (ITSP) and solutions for   a client base=
 in the rapidly growing ITSP marketplace for small-to-medium sized business=
es.    HYPD is capable of handling a wide range of its clients? unique ITSP=
 needs, with services ranging from conventional IT services to enterprise m=
igration and comprehensive IT HyperSource solutions (outsourcing all of a c=
lient?s e-business needs).  HYPD has positioned its future business strateg=
y around the development of uniquely designed Integrated Technology Centers=
 (ITCs), which will offer client companies comprehensive bundled ITSP servi=
ces and solutions integrated with its state of the art facilities.  The fir=
st Houston based ITC has recently begun operations, and is offering its cli=
ents a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and back-office services. =
HYPD?s first ITC is designed around an AT&T Dedicated Entrance Facility wit=
h on-net redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an =
OC-48 and beyond.  Th! is comprehensive Tier-1 hosting center enables HYPD =
to offer clients complete end-to-end IT services in a fully redundant and s=
eamless environment.  Through recently developed Hyperserve connection prod=
ucts, HYPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by of=
fering clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC.  Bolstered=
 by strategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players=
 in technology and telecommunications, including Microsoft, Intel, AT&T, an=
d Great Plains, HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the un=
ique needs and limitations of small-to-medium sized businesses, effectively=
 creating a business model that partners HYPDS? success with that of its cl=
ients.  Utilizing this innovative approach, HYPD should be able to grow its=
 business in conjunction with client business growth, and position itself a=
s the ITSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mi! d siz=
ed companies.  Within the Houston region, and with this small and mid sized=
 target market, HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially =
over the near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance withi=
n an appreciable time period.     HYPD has recently aimed its full-service =
IT hosting business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of=
 small to medium-sized businesses, a rapidly growing market that is relativ=
ely undeserved by major IT service providers such as Level 3, UUNet, and Sp=
rint.    HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative, lon=
g-term revenue streams afforded through association with growing companies.=
  For example, HYPD has recently initiated long-term Hypersource IT hosting=
 arrangements with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group.  =
Eagle Wireless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipm=
ent and services for a variety of markets, including the Internet, digital =
set-top boxes, and wireless convergence products, and is anticipated to rea=
ch national market penetration within the next several years.  As the clien=
t company grows its business over the next several years, the highly scalab=
le nature of the Hyperdynamics? IT hosting model will enable the Company to=
 offer additional needed services readily while retaining high margins.  By=
 being able to refine and scale! up client IT services in a quick time peri=
od, and for minimal additional expenses, HYPD has opened up access to signi=
ficant and recurring long-term revenue streams from smaller and mid-sized b=
usiness clients.  Moreover, HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented d=
egree of personalized attention and customization, when compared to major n=
ational ITSP providers.      The infrastructure of HYPD?S first ITC, design=
ed to support end-to-end ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and s=
mart diversification. With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer System=
s, Inc. (SCS), HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data manage=
ment market. Thus, in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP=
 services, new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities of=
fering diversified revenue streams are coming to HYPD.    For example, SCS =
is a seismic data management company that has developed a unique and cost s=
aving method for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas com=
panies on 8mm and 9mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD (optical) stor=
age.  The current methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes ar=
e time consuming, prohibitively expensive, outdated (the technology is over=
 40 years old), and inefficient.  SCS will enable clients in the expanding =
oil and gas industry to migrate the estimated 3 billion magnetic tapes that=
 degrade in 8-20 years to DVD storage, with an expected lifespan of over 50=
 years, at a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility.  The SCS acqu=
isition, moreover, provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center =
business of HYPD, and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue str=
eams.  SCS will derive revenue! s from three principal sources: (1) convers=
ion of existing tapes to superior DVD storage technologies; (2) accessing D=
VD data through HYPD?s ITC facility; and (3) a vertical ASP approach to rem=
ote seismic interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using=
 technical and hardware support from Intel.  In addition to opening up an i=
nnovative and new business through the SCS acquisition, HYPD believes that =
it will be able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other t=
arget industries, such as insurance services, either through additional acq=
uisitions or joint ventures.      HYPD?s projected revenue and business gro=
wth will be largely driven by several principal catalysts, including: (1) c=
ontinuing to implement its full service IT hosting solution, Hypersource, t=
hrough the Houston-based, state-of-the-art Integrated Technology Center and=
 future planned ITC?s in regional markets; (2) orienting its ITSP solutions=
 and services towards the unique needs of expanding small-and-medium sized =
businesses; (3) entering into long-term, recurring revenue contracts by gro=
wing with its clients, and providing additional services at higher margins =
as these client businesses expand; (4) opening up new and lucrat! ive reven=
ue streams through its subsidiary SCS, and integrating this business opport=
unity through internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services busi=
ness; and (5) positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketp=
lace for ITSP services and products for small and mid-sized business client=
s.      VALUATION   Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consi=
stent theme within the past several years.  Major ITSP hosting players have=
 been acquired in a series of recognizable transactions.  Notable among the=
se has been the acquisition of Verio by NTT, and the acquisition of Digex b=
y WorldCom.  Within the remaining players in the IT hosting industry, remai=
ning players have been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded, ba=
sed on consistently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of serv=
ices provided.  In addition, these players have suffered due to aggressive =
acquisition strategies undertaken during the previous two years that have n=
ot proven out as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures=
.  By contrast, HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limite=
d acquisitions carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit agg=
regate revenues and earnings.  Relative to comparative companies within the=
 ITSP industry, HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings=
 over the near-to-intermediate term period.  A grouping of comparable compa=
nies within this sector currently trades at an average price to sales multi=
ple of 2.70 X.  On a forward looking basis, using FY 2003 revenue and earni=
ngs estimates for the Company (fiscal year 2003 starts July 1,2002), this r=
epresents roughly a 8-fold premium to current trading levels.  Thus, when a=
pplying the comparative grouping?s average price to earnings and price to r=
evenue multiples to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of $4.30 per=
 share over the next 12 months.         SUMMARY   Aggressive investors look=
ing for above-average return potential on a portion of their investment cap=
ital should give HYPD a serious look.  Management of the Company, headed by=
 CEO Kent Watts, are highly talented and educated in their technical areas.=
  We believe HYPD has assembled an astute, goal oriented, sophisticated tea=
m committed to HYPD becoming very, very successful.  Investors at current l=
evels may be rewarded in the short term, and beyond, as HYPD?S business pla=
n is executed.  HYPD may very well be one of the stock market?s best secret=
