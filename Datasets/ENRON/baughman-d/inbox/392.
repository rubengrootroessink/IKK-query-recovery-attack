Don:

I hope that all is well on your end (Enron/Dynegy merger?) & that your
holiday was great.  I'll be interested to hear about your hunting fortunes!

As you suggested in our last conversation a few weeks ago, I'm following up
with you shortly after Thanksgiving.  I just left you a Vmail message to
continue the process in finalizing our win-win "business
arrangement/partnership" regarding the creation and trading of a TNE-Cinergy
index on EOL. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
Thanks.
