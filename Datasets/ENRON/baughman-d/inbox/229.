Discovered a light gray cat with green eyes Dec 23rd and have been
feeding it as I thought it was my neighbors, who was out of
town,discovered today upon their return that it was not.Very loving and
has a strange pom pom type tail (looks like a lions tail).No color but
sure was lonely.Call Mary McKay 281-332-6081 if you know of it's owner.
