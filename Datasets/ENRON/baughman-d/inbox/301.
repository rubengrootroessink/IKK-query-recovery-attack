David, could you let me know who on your team has the right skillset to par=
ticipate in a conference call Monday morning to discuss phase in of MISO op=
erations.  I suspect that it is the person who primarily arranges transacti=
ons through OASIS and/or schedules.  As discussed on Monday afternoon this =
is the chance to ensure that our operational people are on top of the trans=
ition to MISO.

cheers
MR

Smith, could you let me know who the right scheduler is.....

Mike,

MISO announced at the Policy Subcommittee meeting yesterday that it would b=
e phasing in Day One operations pursuant to the proposal outlined below.  C=
ommercial operations would commence on the basis of MISO's ISO (rather than=
 RTO) status, although MISO anticipates that FERC will designate it an RTO =
on December 19 (this anticipation on the basis of discussions between Jim T=
orgenson and FERC at the NARUC meetings last week).  MISO foresees many que=
stions regarding implementation of the phasein, and is requesting that a wo=
rking group representing all sectors be established to work with the transm=
ission owners to accomplish the phase-in.  A conference call will be held o=
n Monday November 19 to put together the working group and organize its act=
ivities (call in number not yet distributed).  It was clear from yesterday'=
s meeting that the first efforts of the working group will be to work throu=
gh implementation issues for the December 15 actiivities; subsequent effort=
s will be dedicated to January 1 and February 1 implementation.  The outcom=
e of the working group's December 15 implementation recommendations will be=
 presented to an interim meeting of the Advisory Committee on December 5.
