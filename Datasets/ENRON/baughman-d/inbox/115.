Dear Investor,

By now, the scope of the opportunity -- at least to
most people -- is crystal clear.

China is one of the world's last great growth markets.
An arena where nimble companies and savvy investors
will reap OBSCENE PROFITS for years to come.

China's GDP is growing at a 7%+ annual clip; and its
entry into the World Trade Organization and successful
bid to host the 2008 Olympics, legitimize its place in
the modern world.  Name almost any industry, and I can
show you how it will profit from the China Phenomenon.

BUT IF YOU pushed me to select just one...to name the
single industry where the profits will be virtually
unlimited, I would say this: The Chinese WIRELESS
explosion is your ticket to true wealth.

*Mainland China passed the U.S. this year in sheer
number of wireless subscribers. Yet the percentage of
its population with access to telecom services is
still just a paltry 9%.

*Spending on telecom infrastructure will EXPLODE over
the next several years.  China's government plans to
spend an additional $151 BILLION by 2005.

*What's more, while spending in Europe and the U.S.
has dried up this year, investment in China has
SOARED!  Capital spending is some 66% ahead of last
year's levels.

*Demand is growing briskly.  At the end of 2000, China
had 267 million telecom subscribers.  By 2004, that
number will reach 691 MILLION!  And wireless -- the
platform most favored by government and the general
populace -- will grow nearly 75% this year!

IT'S OBVIOUS to anyone paying attention...the
OPPORTUNITY IS HUGE!  But...the very biggest profits --
life-changing profits -- will come from a source VERY
SURPRISING to most investors.

Who do you think might be the biggest beneficiaries of
all this growth?  Lucent, which has really good
technology in this area?  Texas Instruments, the chip-
maker that supplies the chips used in most digital
phones?  Or maybe one of the quasi-governmental
Chinese companies with an "inside track?"

That, my friend, is the SURPRISING PART of this
MONSTER GROWTH story.  The big winner won't be any one
of those choices -- or any other big-name firm you
might think of.

No indeed, the BIG WINNER -- and a real prize for
savvy investors who get in now -- will be a little,
but already profitable, company headquartered in
Alameda, California.  IT'S A NAME that 99% of all
investors have never heard of.  But it's a name that
you -- if you act now -- will remember with great
fondness for the rest of your life.

The story starts with something called "PHS
technology."

You see, the wireless technology you're used to in
this country uses cellular networks that deploy large,
powerful base stations to service a wide area.  But
PHS technology uses large amounts of small stations --
on telephone poles, stop signs and the like -- to
saturate densely populated urban areas.

And that's why this technology will dominate the China
market.

90% of Chinese wireless subscribers are "intra-city"
users.  They don't often travel.  They spend most of
their time living and working in the same, densely
populated area.  And that, my friend, is the perfect
match for PHS technology.

WHAT'S MORE, PHS is 5-times cheaper than the other
technologies.  That also makes it the perfect choice
in a country where the average person earns less than
$4,000 a year!  No wonder the PHS market is booming --
I expect it to grow ten-times bigger over the next few
years.

It's a spectacular opportunity.  And the little U.S.
company I'm recommending to my California Technology
Stock Letter (CTSL) subscribers right now...is the BEST
WAY for investors like you to profit from the China
wireless boom.

At CTSL, we specialize in staying AHEAD OF THE CURVE
-- and reaping huge profits ahead of the crowd, when
the true fortunes are made:

*We jumped on Intel in 1994, when most analysts
scoffed at its prospects.  Three years later, we sold
for 575% GAINS.

*In July 1998, Power Integrations got no respect on
Wall Street.  But I practically screamed at clients
to, "BUY!" -- because unlike most analysts I actually
understood its breakthrough technologies.  We better
than tripled our money in less than six months' time.

*DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in 1998 when
we gobbled up all we could.  Our 1,316% gains turned
$25,000 into more than $350,000.

NOW TODAY, wireless is the name of the game.  China is
where it's at.  And this little company from Alameda,
California is ready to rock!  How high can it go?
Think 50% profits near-term.  Long term, the sky's the
limit.  You'll get the name, full details and my "buy
under" price when you accept a RISK-FREE trial
subscription to my California Technology Stock Letter
now.

As you'll see:

*This company has a top-flight management team -- one
of the best in the industry.  And its laser-like focus
on telecom's fastest growth markets has kept it out of
the recent troubles many competitors have faced.

*Business is booming.  The company has a solid backlog
of orders.  And it's on track to generate 54% year-
over-year top-line growth.

*Its financial model is solid.  The company should
earn about 64 cents a share this year and 86 cents in
2002.  That represents 45% and 34% year-over-year
growth, respectively.  Gross margins are running at a
fat 35%.

*And these guys have staying power.  I'm particularly
impressed by this company's commitment to R&D.  896 of
its 2,041 employees -- or 44% -- are engineers.  And
the R&D budget runs at a healthy 10% of sales.

THAT MAKES this stock a short and long-term winner in
my book.  And the single best way for you to profit --
in a really BIG WAY -- from the wireless revolution
transforming communications in China.

P.S.  I founded CTSL back in 1982 -- years before it
was "hip" to be a tech investor.  Quite simply, I
understood the technologies and saw a HUGE opportunity
for a select group of investors to rack up oversized
profits.  And my loyal CTSL subscribers have done just
that -- enjoying average annualized returns on all
CTSL recommendations of 53% since 1982.  Now as I look
ahead, our prospects have never been brighter.  There
are fortunes to be made in 2002 and for many years to
come.  DON'T MISS OUT.  Go here now:
