1. Profiting from the Post-September 21 Rebound (GNSS)

The stock market bottomed on September 21 and a new bull
market is now underway, says Don Rowe. In a recent hotline
to subscribers, he supports this assertion by listing the
post-September 21 performance of a number of major indices.
These include the DJIA (+23%), Nasdaq (+43%), tech-heavy
Nasdaq 100 (+51%) and semiconductor index (+63%). "Become
fully invested," he advises.

One of Rowe's current stock picks is Genesis Microchip
(GNSS), a top maker of integrated circuits (IC) that process
graphic images and digital video. The firm's image
processing ICs are used in flat-panel displays, digital TVs
and consumer video products. Q3 saw earnings grow 190% on a
141% sales gain thanks to higher operating margins and
rising shipments.

Rowe also recommends the Nasdaq 100 Index Tracking Stock
(QQQ) as "a good long-term investment." Sponsored by a
subsidiary of the Nasdaq exchange, QQQ offers a portfolio of
the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100 index. Rowe praises
the diversification QQQ offers; the Nasdaq 100 currently
includes companies in computer hardware and software,
telecom, retail and wholesale trade, and biotech.

Investment Summary," December 2001, The Wall Street Digest.

funds capable of generating 26+% annual returns.

2. Year 2001 Picks +36%, New Advice Just Released (CSPLF)

At the beginning of 2001, Frank Curzio published 10 stock
picks he felt would outperform this year. His year-end
follow-up report shows he was right; Curzio's stocks gained
36% this year vs. declines of 30.7% for the Nasdaq, 6.2% for
the DJIA and 15.4% for the S&P 500.

For 2002, Curzio recommends accumulating undervalued oil &
gas stocks saying the sector "will advance sharply next year
from current lows." He offers three aggressive selections,
and one of them is Canada Southern Petroleum (CSPLF). The
company explores and develops areas of the US and Canada
believed to contain oil and gas reserves. Curzio is
especially bullish about prospects for its 30% stake in the
Kotaneelee gas field.

Curzio also recommends three conservative oil & gas plays
including the giant Chevron Texaco (CVX). Management says
the merger of Chevron and Texaco will save $1.8 billion by
March 2003. It owns 30% of a project to take oil from a
Venezuelan region that contains the world's largest known
hydrocarbon deposit. Curzio quotes estimates of 2.1 billion
barrels from this reservoir. "Buy," he says.

Market News," December 2001, The FXC Newsletter. Francis X.
Curzio provides asset growth and capital preservation with a
list of picks in key categories.

3. "Security Portfolio" Off to a Flying Start (NETA)

In late November 2001, newsletter watcher Gregory Spear
launched what he calls his "Security Portfolio" of stocks
recommended by his favored investment advisors. These
particular stocks should benefit from heightened attention
to security and safety in travel, business, commerce,
communications and medicine. In one month, this model
portfolio gained 10.45%, outpacing the S&P 500 (+2.64%) and
the Nasdaq composite (+9.56%).

Spear just added three new positions to this portfolio. One
is Network Associates (NETA), a stock that enjoys buy
recommendations from Dan Sullivan (The Chartist) and Jim
Collins (OTC Insight). Network Associates makes the popular
McAfee line of anti-virus software along with other programs
that help corporations and governments manage their network
security concerns.

Experts say malicious attacks on networks doubled in 2001
and are likely to keep growing in number. Spear holds that
IT managers will opt for veteran security providers like
Network Associates, and he adds that the market agrees as
the stock is on a tear. He also points to higher spending on
security despite IT budget cuts. "We like Network Associates
on dips," he says.

Letters," December 10, 2001, The Spear Report. Consensus

4. A Safe Tech Bet for Low-Risk Investors (EDS)

Wall Street analysts upped their ratings for Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) after it beat estimates by a penny per share.
That prompted a buy recommendation from brokerage watcher
Ben Zacks. The consulting giant offers systems integration,
network and systems operations, data center management and
other services.

Zacks notes that EDS gets new business in down economies as
companies cut other expenses to fund systems projects that
cut costs and improve productivity. For instance, EDS just
won a $1.5 billion contract extension from Xerox along with
a $2.2 billion contract earlier this year with Sabre, the
airline reservation management system.

EDS earned $0.44 a share last quarter. But Zacks subtracts
an after-tax acquisitions charge and concludes that the firm
posted a profit of $334 million ($0.69 per share). Stock in
EDS trades at 26x this year's EPS estimate of $2.66, and
Zacks predicts shares will reach $80 by mid-2002. "EDS is a
safe technology name for low-risk tolerant investors," Zacks
says.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see "Hotline," December 10,
2001, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses earnings estimate
revisions from analysts at brokerages to select stocks
likely to outperform the market over the next 12 months.

5. Three Promising New Economy Stocks Below $10 (SSYS)

Rich Moroney says the phrase "new economy" turns the
stomachs of many investors as they view the late 1990s
rally as a scam. "But not all of it was hype," he says.
Technology continues to transform the US economy, and the
end of the tech bubble doesn't alter long-term fundamentals.
"The stage is set for a recovery," he says, and he offers
three attractive bargains for year-ahead gains.

One of Moroney's selections is Stratasys (SSYS). Giants like
GM, Lockheed Martin and Motorola use the tiny firm's
products to create 3D prototypes from plastic. With the
firm's machines, customers can cut the time to make
prototypes from weeks to hours.

Moroney likes how Stratasys chalked up strong profit gains
in a tough economic climate. Last quarter, EPS rocketed to
$0.18 from $0.03 a year ago; analysts had predicted a paltry
$0.04. Strong demand for new models boosted sales 8%. The
firm has $8 million in cash on hand, or $1.45 per share.
With a market cap of just $30 million, Stratasys "is a small
fry compared to rivals," Moroney says. "The stock is rated
'best buy.'"

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see "Three Tech Stocks
Below $10," December 3, 2001, Low Priced Stock Survey.
Richard Moroney offers fundamentally solid small- and mid-
caps ready to soar 40% to 400%+.
