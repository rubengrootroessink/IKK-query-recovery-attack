Don, 
 
I also need the list of people who are working the xmas holiday so that I can get them added in the system as well.
 
Hope your holiday was a good one...see you soon,

Kevin asked that one scheduler work on Monday to field any scheduling questions that might come up.  I was the lucky candidate.  Please put me on the payroll list w/ the other  Hourly guys that had to work on the Company holiday.

Thanks, Pat
