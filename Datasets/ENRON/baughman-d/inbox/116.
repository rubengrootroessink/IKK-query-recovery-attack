  Dear Investor,   If there ever was a time you needed a plan, this is it.   [IMAGE] It's not enough to simply buy beaten down stocks that look like great values.  Buy indiscriminately now...and you're likely to wake up one morning, turn on the tube, and discover your stock's price down another 20%.  All because your stock "missed its earnings" again -- and you missed out on better opportunities once more.   In the 2nd quarter 800 companies pre-warned of bad results.  Earnings plunged 67% as a whole according to The Wall Street Journal.  And third quarter results were just as dismal -- with overall earnings sinking like a rock again.  Yet the companies my clients and I own  are doing BETTER THAN EVER!   As you'll see shortly, we've survived the worst bear market of the last twenty-five years...and enjoyed nice gains along the way, as well.  Now you can, too.  How?    I'll sum up our plan in two simple words.  The only companies we own are...
