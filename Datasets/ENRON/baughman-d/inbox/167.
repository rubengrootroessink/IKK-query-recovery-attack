At my Technology Investing advisory, we reap HUGE
GAINS from the opportunities other investors miss.

OUR SECRET WEAPON?  A laser-like focus on All-Tech,
All-the-Time.  You see, most investment advisors pride
themselves on a broad reach across dozens of industries.
They claim that gives you more opportunities to profit.

But that's JUST BALONEY.  There's no way one
individual -- or even a substantial team -- can spread
himself that thin and still do quality research...especially
when it comes to the complex world of high tech.

That's why my team and I do ONE THING, and one thing only.
We target the hottest growth markets of technology -- from
microchips to software to biotech.  And we reap the profits
 most investors miss.

DID YOU OWN Immunex, for example?

I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of this
fast-growing biotech firm.  When that deal was announced
yesterday, it included a 17% premium for our Immunex stock.
But our profits -- locked in after I advised clients to
sell in an urgent email bulletin -- were much higher than
that.  We banked 105% GAINS in just 8-months' time.

I hope you owned Immunex.  But if you didn't, don't worry
about it.  In just a moment I'll tell you all about my c
urrent #1 PICK -- another overlooked stock that should
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY at least in 2002....then multiply it
5-times over by 2007.

BUT FIRST, an important lesson to be learned from Immunex.
Don't believe everything you hear on Wall Street.

Back when we bought Immunex, traders were down on almost
everything related to the drug industry.  And I agreed with
them -- to a point.  You see, the big drug companies are
facing intense pressure from generic drug-makers.  Merck's
big disappointment is a perfect example -- 0% earnings growth
next year.  That's pitiful in today's drug hungry world.

But as the baby boomers pass into their "golden years,"
drugs are still a HUGE PLAY.  just not in the traditional
way.  Most big pharma companies -- like Merck, Pfizer and
J&J -- have really slipped when it comes to new drug
development.

But INNOVATIVE biotechs like Immunex are a totally different
story.  Their R&D is RED-HOT.  So when Wall Street tarred
the traditional firms and biotechs with the same brush...we
stepped in to pick Immunex up for a song.

Eight months later, we're 105% RICHER.  Now, we're about to
pull off another profit coup just like it -- but with MUCH
BIGGER potential.  And this time around, YOU have the
opportunity to join us.

Here's the truth about today's so-called communications
"fiber glut" that everyone keeps talking about:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed
down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly
came to a grinding halt!  That means there isn't nearly
enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to
accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about
this problem.  After all, this is the second time it's
happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed
the Internet to a crawl for two full days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore our
economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's how
banks and brokerages transfer funds...how dispatchers route
fleets of trucks...how many Americans get paid through
direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently said
they're 60% loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound
too bad...until you understand how these networks operate.
You can't load a network much past 65%.  In fact, 70% is
virtually CATASTROPHIC -- because the network spends so
much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes
to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world.
Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia,
Europe and even South America.  That's because we push out
more data than everyone else -- but we're not increasing
capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up fast!
Otherwise business, the economy and our national security
all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber glut?"
Because  95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is
"dark" -- that is, it's not activated.  And the company I'm
recommending is the #1 supplier of the components needed to do
the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by
this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
"ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly
20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump
$100 billion in emergency spending into the economy; interest
rates are practically zero; and the need isn't just vital
for the economy anymore -- it's a question of NATIONAL
SECURITY!

if I'm right -- and I'm staking my reputation and my own money
on this call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.
This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's already UP 41%
since October 1st, in recognition of this company's vital new
role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained
to the limits.  And get this --- data traffic is DOUBLING every
year now.  That means a network running at 63% of capacity needs
to double its load by this time next year just to keep up.
That's why the fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be
lit.  Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.
