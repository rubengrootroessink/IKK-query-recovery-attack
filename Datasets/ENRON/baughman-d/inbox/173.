It appears that our vandals were just in the area and happened to be
attracted by the lights.  In my haste to get the email out and go ride the
neighborhood, I said Rampart and I meant Royal.  The young gentlemen were
seen walking and thanks to the quick action of several people, they were
talked to by A big thank you to LCPD again for their support and patrols .
No one could prove that it was those young men, but there was reasonable
suspicion.  Royal looks great and was just the invitation someone needed to
enter the neighborhood and get mischievous.  Obviously, they have not concept
of the time and efforts that go into the decorating of the wonderful yards.
If you have not been out to drive the neighborhood, please do.  The traffic
was incredible.  The village looks great.  Thank you all for your efforts.

Also, I have been told that the tree cutters are not totally responsible
about the closing of gates and dogs are being let out.  If you gave
permission for that company to be in your yard, please contact them if you
have a problem.  Also, let me know if you pet was let out.  Once again, watch
out for your neighbors and their pets.  If you see a stray that you
recognize, be a good neighbor and corral the critter.

Have a safe and happy holiday.
