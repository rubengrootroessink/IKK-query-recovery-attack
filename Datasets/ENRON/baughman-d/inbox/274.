Subject: Isn't  it Funny
Do you  think YOU will pass it on??? 
  
  
One day Satan and  Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden  of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. "Yes, sir, I just caught  the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew  they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!" 
"What are you going to do with  them?" Jesus asked. 
Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun!  I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate  and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna  teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm  really gonna have fun!" 
"And what will you do when you get done  with them?" Jesus asked. 
"Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.  
"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked. 
"Oh, you don't  want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and  they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and  kill you!! You don't want those people!!" 
"How much?" He asked  again. 
Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all  your blood." 
Jesus said, "DONE!"   Then He paid the price.  
  
Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God  and then wonder why the world's going to hell.  
Isn't it funny  how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible  says.  
Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven  provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything  the Bible says. Or is it scary? 
Isn't it funny how someone can  say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also  "believes" in God). 
Isn't it funny how you can send a  thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when  you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice  about sharing. 
Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar  and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public  discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and  workplace. >  Isn't it funny how someone can be so fired  up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the  week. 
Are you laughing? 
Isn't it funny how when you go to  forward this message, you will not send it to many on your  address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they  will think of you for sending it to them. 
Isn't it funny how I can  be more worried about what other people think of me than what God  thinks of me. 
  
 Will YOU pass this on?  
 I did.
