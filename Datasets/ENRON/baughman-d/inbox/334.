Hey guys,=20

I need to let you guys know what is going on with the desk. The winter is f=
ast approaching and it will be cold soon, and OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY W=
ILL PRESENT themselves. We have some very young talent on the desk, so we n=
eed to work extra hard to get ourselves prepared! The money has slowed down=
 on the physical side, and we need to continue to work the relationships in=
 anticipation of the winter. We need to hit the phones extra hard in the we=
eks to come. Please make sure you have access to all the oasis sites and be=
come very familiar with what it takes to move power region to region. I don=
't want to miss a blow-out day because someone on the desk is unfamiliar wi=
th a region or hasn't done that specific transaction. I want everyone to co=
ntinue to work new deals, however if it doesn't make sense, get out of it, =
make it work, or use that relationship to help you out when your in trouble=
 down the road. From November 15 - February 15 of last year, we made close =
to 2 millions dollars. It might be slow now, but we need to minimize the mi=
stakes, and make some money.

Let me know if you have any questions.=20
