Don and Punit:

The switch is set.  Punit will take two days for me in November and I'll pick up his two in December. The changes are already in the schedule.  Don, if you have any problems with this--please let us know.

Thanks
Carrie

Hi Desk,

I need to swap off the last 2 days of this yr a.k.a the 30th and the 31st of dec cos I already have a ski trip planned over the end of the yr starting post christmas. I am working days on the aforementioned dates (thank god for small mercies..so no one has to disrupt their new-yr nite plans) so with all the holiday pay and a chance to take off any 2 days from now till then and have me fill em in for u..should i hope entice someone at least.

Here's to waiting for your +ve replies.

Cheers,


Punit.
