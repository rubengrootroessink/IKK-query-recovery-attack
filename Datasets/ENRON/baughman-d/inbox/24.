Little David comes home from first grade and tells his father that they
learned about the history of Valentine's Day.  "Since Valentine's day is
for a Christian saint and we're Jewish," he asks, "will God get mad at
me for giving someone a valentine?"

David's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get
mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"
"Osama Bin Laden," David says.
"Why Osama Bin Laden," his father asks in shock.

"Well," David says, "I thought that if a little American Jewish boy
could have enough love to give
Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad,
and maybe start loving people a little bit.  And if other kids saw what
I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot.  And then
he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved
them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."

His father's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride.
"David, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."
"I know," David says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the
Marines could blow the shit out of him."
