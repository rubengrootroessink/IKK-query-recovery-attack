Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I've just revealed a BRAND-NEW wireless recommendation
to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited about this
opportunity that I want to share the details with you,
too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either-these royalties get paid on
a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in the
following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research and
development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I revealed the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which just got released.
