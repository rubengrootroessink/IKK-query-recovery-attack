Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
"fiber glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is "dark" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
