Subject: FW: Big Boy harvested


Jeff Duncan of Sanger, Texas shot the deer they call "Big Boy" at Hagerman
National Wildlife Refuge in Grayson County with a bow on Sunday afternoon.
His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230
6/8.
He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be
10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several
times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but
the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived.
Congratulations
to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.
