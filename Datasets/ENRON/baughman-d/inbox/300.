Plan a weekend to come down anytime.  We can take it to the cabin in the
land cut for the weekend.  The weather is perfect for it right now, plus
we can duck hunt and fish.

Anyway, have a good one and we'll talk to you later.

	I'm ready for the fishing!  I was able to ride on Joe's boat
after he got
	it, very nice.  It should run very skinny.

	I hope all is well.

	Later,
	DB

	   Thanks for the invite.  I wish I could make it.  You need to
plan a trip
	   down here for a little fin and feather.  Joe got himself a
nice custom
	   flats and we need to break it in right.  A lot of geese and
ducks are
	   being killed on lake Mathis right now and I'm sure we can
manage to find
	   some trout somewhere.

	   Happy birthday and drink one for me.
