Attention MAPP OASIS Users:

On Thursday, November 8, MAPP will be doing up to 1 hour of database maintenance 
starting at 5:30am CT and ending at 6:30am CT.  The OASIS node will be available 
for making reservations, but there may be a slight delay in processing. 

If at all possible please have reservations for the next hour in before 5:25am 
CT. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The ultimate goal of this 
maintenance is continue the quick turn around of transmission requests.
