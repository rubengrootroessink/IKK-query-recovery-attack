Subject: Ski  Trip 2002
Hello Everyone,
 
Well, I looked around again for another  inexpensive ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to  lead the same direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far  the cheapest package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of  you who went last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and  great atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the  evening of January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd  (Sun.).
 
The vacation package is through Southwest  Airlines Vacations.
 
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
 
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
 
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
 
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
 
This can be all yours for 359.75 per  person.  This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know  who would like to go no later than Wednesday afternoon so I can set up  reservations.  These trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do  like last year.  I will call in the reservations and then each individual  person will be able to call Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own  credit card.  The only other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift  tickets and roundtrip transfer from the airport to the hotel and back.   This cost is $30.  I figure we will discuss the lift ticket  options.  Some people may want to Snowmobile a day or do something  else.  We will discuss these options further after the trip is  set.
 
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24" on the mountain  yesterday.
 
Mason is going.  I just don't have his  e-mail address but he said to count him in.
