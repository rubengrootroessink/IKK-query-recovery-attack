David, as per emails last week this will be Enrons only chance to participate and provide feedback to MISO as it starts up operations.  Kerry was on the call this morning and while Enron may be able to add a member to this group it will be difficult.  If you are interested coordinate with Kerry...

regards
Mike

Mike, here's some addtional information about the working group that was put together on this morning's conference call to work through implementation issues associated with MISO's commercial start-up.  Earlier this morning I emailed an agenda for the call and a revised commercial operation start-up plan.  

The purpose of the call was to establish a small working group to identify and resolve, from a market perspective,  the issues associated with MISO's proposed start-up plan.  The working group will be working closely with transmission owner reps who are looking at start-up implementation from a systems perspective.  The working group will have a conference call on November 26 (the purpose of the call is to identify all of the implementation issues) , and working sessions on 12/3 and 12/4 prior to a presentation to an interim meeting of the MISO Advisory Committee on issues associated with 12/15 implementation plans.  The group will meet thereafter, at times yet unspecified, to deal with implementation issues associated with 1/1 and 2/1 implementation (including for example MISO tariff administration begining 1/1 for point-to-point and possibly existing network service and beginning 2/1 for new network service requests).

Persons/entities named to the working group this morning included Richard Doying, PGE; Jim Stanton, Calpine; someone from WPPI; Bill Jett, Cinergy Trading; Greg ____ from Dynegy; Rob Martin from Wisconsin Electric; Jim Bradkowski, DTE; and Malcolm Burgess, ATC.  If someone from Enron wishes to be added, they should talk to John Caitlin of the MISO staff ASAP.  John Caitlin is also accepting emails identifying implementation issues associated with the commercial operation plan that need to be resolved.
