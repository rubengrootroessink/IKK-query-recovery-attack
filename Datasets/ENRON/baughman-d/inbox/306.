"Medical Terms"
 
Two Texans were having the blue-plate special at their favorite watering
hole when they heard an awful choking sound. They turned around to see a
lady a few bar stools down turning blue from wolfing down an Armadillo
burger too fast. 
 
The first Texan said to the other, "Think we ought to help?" 
 
"Yep," said the second Texan. 
 
The first Texan got up and walked over to the lady and asked, "Can you
breathe?" 
 
She shook her head no. 
 
"Can you speak?" he asked. 
 
She shook her head no again. 
 
With that, he helped her to her feet, lifted up her skirt and started to
lick her butt. She was so shocked, she coughed up the obstruction and
began to breathe, with great relief. 
 
The first Texan turned back to his friend and said, "Funny how that Hind
Lick Maneuver works every time!"
