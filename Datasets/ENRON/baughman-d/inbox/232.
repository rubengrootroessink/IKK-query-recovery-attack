Happy New Year, ClearHeads!
Welcome to the ClearStation News for January.  This month
we cover recent site news and give you a preview of exciting
changes to our Recommend and Help areas.

------------------------------------------------------------
Movin' On Up - About our new home
------------------------------------------------------------

In mid-November we took ClearStation offline in order to
move the site to  a new home in an E*TRADE co-location
facility. (Notice our new url,http://clearstation.etrade.com).
This substantially reduces our operating costs and helps
ensure ClearStation's continued existence as a free site.
Unfortunately, some issues arose during the move that we
hadn't foreseen. We apologize for the poor performanceof the
site in the weeks following the move.

We regret the problems that arose, and can safely say that
most of them have been corrected.  If you experience
problems with delayed or incorrect quotes, login problems,
poor site performance or broken graphs please send us an
email with your user name and a detailed description of the
problem.

------------------------------------------------------------
Recommend 2.0: Ask and you shall receive!
------------------------------------------------------------

We've been getting lots of feedback and requests about our
Recommend feature, so we rolled the best of them into
Recommend 2.0. You'll be able to rate other ClearHeads, see
graphs of each Recommend portfolio's sector holdings (by
percentage), select an "investment type" for each
Recommendation, and view realized gains and losses.  Start
paring down your Recommend lists, because the new format
only allows forty open recommendations. Watch for more info
about Recommend 2.0 in the coming weeks. Just can't wait?
Send us your questions.

support@clearstation.com


------------------------------------------------------------
Help 2.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Our Help area is being overhauled, so watch out for a new
look and feel plus updated content (including a section on
the new Recommend). There's still time to get your two cents
in: if there's anything you'd like to see covered in Help,
let us know!

Tell It Like It Is
------------------------------------------------------------

Topic-Based Discussion

http://www.clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/discuss

The latest addition to the top nav is a link to our topic-
based discussion area. Join the ClearHeads already talking
about Day Trading, Trading Strategies, and Market Direction.
Since we know there's more to life than the stock market,
we've included an Off-Topic discussion forum. Don't forget,
it's your community - make sure to let us know if you have
an idea for a new topic. Send email to:

discusstopic@clearstation.com
