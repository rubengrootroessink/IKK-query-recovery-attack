Pat Hallisey ws kind enough to pass on this information.

Just a note that our good friend Cathy Pauls (acacia north) passed away
yesterday morning.   Visitation is at 10-11 Sat. morning with a mass at St.
Mary's catholic church at 11:00am. This is all the info I have but Cathy was
loved by all that new her.  She will be sadly missed.
Pat

Our thought and prayers are with the family.  Mary G. Strickland
