=09[IMAGE]=09Dear Economist.com reader  cover imageThe latest issue of The =
Economist Technology Quarterly (TQ) has just been published. For the first =
time you will be able to discuss the articles online at Economist.com in ou=
r TQ Dialogue. This issue of TQ has articles on:  The loss of diversity   T=
he broad diversity of technological design appears to be narrowing. Is inno=
vation running out of big ideas?  Read full article  | Discuss   Speech rec=
ognition  After a number of false starts, speech recognition is finally bec=
oming an important interface between man and machine. In the process it is =
helping to slash costs in business, create new services on the Internet, an=
d make cars a lot safer and easier to drive.  Where else will the technolog=
y lead? Read full article  | Discuss   Deep-water oil exploration  The worl=
d's apparently unquenchable thirst for oil is fuelling a boom in exotic kin=
ds of exploration technology for use in much deeper waters. Will this just =
accelerate depletion? Read full article  | Discuss   IBM and the hard-drive=
 business  The innovation of the "giant magneto-resistive" head?the breakth=
rough that boosted the capacity of hard-drives from a few gigabytes to 100 =
gigabytes and more?came from chance observation, basic research and a vast,=
 painstaking search for the right materials. But is GMR merely a stop-gap s=
olution? Read full article  | Discuss   Virtual organs  Better tools, and m=
ore data, mean that creating virtual organs by computer is no longer a pipe=
-dream. How will this help the drug industry and surgery? Read full article=
  | Discuss   Designer plastics  After years of development, a new breed of=
 catalysts called metallocenes is shaking up the plastics business, rapidly=
 penetrating commodity markets and promising a new age of cheap designer pl=
astics. Are they the revolution proponents claim? Read full article  | Disc=
uss   The wireless pen  With 5,000 years of continuous development and bill=
ions of satisfied customers to its credit, the pen may not seem like a prod=
uct in need of radical improvement. Yet plans are afoot to overhaul the hum=
ble writing instrument completely. With children learning to use computers =
before learning to write, is this a solution in search of a problem?  Read =
full article  | Discuss   Agricultural innovation  Richard Jefferson wants =
to change the face of agriculture by putting innovation back into the hands=
 of farmers. How will he overcome the intellectual-property problems that h=
ave tied up much of the genetic material needed? Read full article  | Discu=
ss   We also write about the new crop of video-game consoles , Infiniband s=
ervers , the aerodynamics of F1 racing-cars , automated e-mail replies , ul=
trasound surgery  and wind-up cell phones .  As you read these articles, we=
 hope you will want to discuss them with us and with each other. Go to http=
://www.economist.com/forums/tq , where you can post your thoughts and read =
other people's.   Please remember that this is intended as an online forum =
for genuine discussion, and the bigger the differences in opinion the bette=
r. It is not a place for offensiveness or shameless self-promotion, corpora=
te or personal.   The next TQ in print will take the best of the threads th=
at have evolved in the TQ Dialogue since the previous issue and discuss the=
m. The current TQ has an analysis  of readers' responses to the question of=
 what will be the technological drivers of the next Schumpeter wave of econ=
omic activity.  So, let the heated arguments begin.   Yours sincerely   Nic=
