Don:

Thanks for your Email update yesterday.  We are excited about assertively
moving forward in our "win-win" arrangement.  I would appreciate your
thoughts on when you will complete your internal evaluation----leading to
finalizing the contract/document between our organizations (if memory serves
we discussed executing by mid/late-November?).  Thanks.
