Best of the Web Today - December 31, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
A Little Too Late  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/national/30TERR.html?pagewanted=all

Just in time for the end of the year (and the Pulitzer entries), the New York Times (link requires registration) publishes a very long (6,000 words plus) and detailed narrative of America's failed antiterror policies, from 1993 to 2001. The Clinton administration part of that story is familiar: The administration was aware of the growing threat from al Qaeda, and took some steps to counter it, but was too distracted by the president's quest for a "legacy," and by his actual legacy (impeachment) to give the matter the kind of sustained attention it needed.

The most interesting detail, though, is that President Bush was actually ahead of the curve, though alas, not by nearly enough:

*** QUOTE ***

Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda. In July, [Condoleezza] Rice said, Mr. Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to "swatting at flies." He said he wanted a plan to "bring this guy down."

*** END QUOTE ***

As the Washington Post previously reported, Bush's national security advisers approved a $200 million anti-al Qaeda plan. But Bush was traveling on the day it was to have been presented to him--Sept. 10.

What a Gas  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570019-2001603346,00.html

Documents found in Kabul houses show that al Qaeda had tested chemical weapons, including cyanide gas, on animals, the Times of London reports. Al Qaeda's knowledge of how to make weapons of mass destruction appears to have been "crude" and the studies "were the work of a variety of autonomous cells, who conducted their own experiments, without collusion." The Times quotes an "intelligence expert" as saying that "this proves a huge problem to the Western security forces. What we can see is the work of different, potentially self-replicating cells, united only by an ideal. They will be far more difficult to extinguish than a centrally organized terrorist force."

Al Qaeda, American Style  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40010-2001Dec29.html

"The FBI is conducting more than 150 separate investigations into groups and individuals in the United States with possible ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda organization," the Washington Post reports. "The domestic targets include dozens of people who are under electronic surveillance through national security warrants, and others who are being watched by undercover agents attempting to learn more about their activities and associates, officials said." Frustratingly but understandably, officials are saying little about the specifics of the investigations.

Protected by the Federal Government  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nyt/20011229/ts/officials_to_ease_requirements_on_hiring_of_airline_screeners_1.html

"After stoking high expectations that the federal takeover of airport security would lead to a new breed of airport security screener, one who was better educated and more qualified to assume a position of increased responsibility, the Department of Transportation has decided not to impose rules that would displace thousands of current screeners," the New York Times reports. In particular, screeners won't have to have high school diplomas; a year's work experience--including experience in the much-derided pre-Sept. 11 airport-security system--will suffice.

"The idea is to allow current screeners who would otherwise qualify but may not have high school diplomas to be eligible, so they do not get left behind," explains the Transportation Department's Paul Takemoto. Well, pardon us if this is a rude question, but wasn't the whole idea of federalizing airport security to leave the old, inadequate screeners behind?

Not as Dumb as He Looked  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-122901profile.story

A pair of Los Angeles Times articles floats the theory that alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid was more sophisticated than he appeared. "He had one most important trait: He was very calm in an extremely stressful situation," Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert from Scotland, tells the Times. The paper adds that "even his down-and-out appearance may have been a reverse undercover strategy, based on a calculation that he looked too obvious to be a real threat." Bolstering this view is an account in the London  Observer  http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,625868,00.html :

*** QUOTE ***

As he passed through security at Charles de Gaulle, an employee of ICTS, the private firm policing the airport, was suspicious. His profile--a lone traveller, who bought his ticket in cash and had no baggage--raised an automatic red flag. His knapsack contained only a Koran, a Walkman with religious tapes and a magazine. Reid claimed he was visiting relatives. He explained his lack of luggage by saying his family had ample clothes for him. The interrogation took so long he missed his flight. He stayed in a hotel at the airline's expense. There had been no body search and no sniffer dogs.

The next morning Reid turned up two hours early for the 10.40 flight. This time security staff--recognising him from the previous day--waved him through.

*** END QUOTE ***

The  second L.A. Times story  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-122901tatp.story  says that Reid's shoes were actually "a relatively sophisticated explosive device," though "not beyond the capability of an individual acting alone." The  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/30/News/News.40789.html  adds that the explosive "was similar to that developed and used by Hamas in suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks."

Another Observer piece  http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,625797,00.html  says that Britain's MI5 intelligence agency "knew of links between shoe bomber Richard Reid and one 11 September hijack suspect late last year, but failed to track Reid before he tried to blow up an airliner, according to US intelligence reports." MI5 "intercepted phone calls between Reid and the suspect, Zacarias Moussaoui, which directly linked Bromley-born Reid to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda net work, but did not realise their implication until it was too late," according to the report.

Jihadi Jailbirds  http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/nmus30.xml

Reid converted to Islam while in prison, and Britain's prisons turn out to be breeding grounds for Islamic extremism, according to a series of reports in the London press. The Telegraph notes that the British government "ignored specific warnings more than a year ago that Muslim extremists were infiltrating prisons and recruiting inmates." And the  Times  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570019-2001603123,00.html  reports that Muslim clerics preaching in British prisons have been told "that they were being watched carefully after two were suspended for allegedly delivering anti-American sermons to young inmates after the September 11 attacks."

In a Telegraph op-ed piece,  Jonathan Aitken  http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/nmus230.xml , a former Conservative member of Parliament who served a prison term for perjury, says that during his time behind bars, "on four occasions, fellow prisoners who were Muslim came to talk to me to see if I would be interested in converting to Islam." Aitken says he had no encounters with Muslim militants, but he observes that "the Richard Reid case is anything but an exception. Rather, it is the militant face of a much broader phenomenon: the Islamic mission that is a new and astonishing feature of British prison life."

Theodore Dalrymple  http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/story.html?f=/stories/20011229/990690.html , a British physician who treats prisoners, explains Islam's appeal to prisoners: "Bonversion to Islam kills two birds with one stone. It fulfils a personal need, but it is also an act of revenge upon society: for official multiculturalism notwithstanding, everyone knows that Western societies are profoundly uneasy about their infiltration by an increasingly confident and militant Islam that uses Western liberal principles to spread itself in the way communism once did."

Dalrymple notes, however, that Islam isn't the only religion that wins converts in prison. "I have noticed a sub-group of prisoners, for example, who turn to Buddhism while incarcerated. They can almost always be recognized physically: they sport pony tails and have an air of unnatural and studied calm. The pony-tailed Buddhist has usually committed the most terrible and violent offences in his past: and from an utter disregard for human life, he suddenly becomes solicitous even about the life of insects."

But Did They Check Her Shoes?  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0112300170dec30.story

A former member of Chicago's Board of Education is behind bars after an outburst at O'Hare International Airport. Police tell the Chicago Tribune that Anna Mustafa, who was the board's first Arab-American member, became irate when she was randomly selected to pass through a bomb-detection machine before boarding a Swissair flight to Tel Aviv. "When told, she became irate and began shouting at the manager and employees and made inappropriate comments that she may have a bomb in her purse," a police spokeswoman says. "People at the next counter heard. People didn't want to board the plane after that." No explosives were found in her bag.

Comfort to the Enemy  http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/1189855

Columnist Helen Thomas, doyenne of the White House press corps, urges President Bush to go easy on Marin mujahid John Walker:

*** QUOTE ***

Perhaps in mulling over Walker's life, he will try to remember when he was a 20-year-old. True, he did not defiantly challenge the system as so many young protesters did in the Vietnam War era. Politics was not his bag at Yale when others were marching in support of civil rights and against the war.

Nor had he yet found religion as the guiding light of his life. He surely knows he was a different person back then. The president has often sought to dismiss his youthful escapades with the cute tautology: "When I was young and foolish, I was young and foolish."

There undoubtedly are many who want Walker to pay with his life. But there are a lot of others in the country who will want Bush to go easier on Walker--a lighter sentence perhaps--with compassion lighting his way. I hope so.

We're a forgiving people. This young man obviously made a big mistake. The president should show that he understands this by setting a merciful course in the Walker case.

*** END QUOTE ***

Before urging forgiveness, wouldn't it be a good idea at least to wait and see if Walker repents and acknowledges he did wrong? So far as we know, there's been no indication he's done so.

More important, Thomas's logic is morally slovenly. Why is Walker entitled to more compassion than the Afghans, Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens and other natives of Muslim lands who've fought for the Taliban and al Qaeda? If anything, a far better argument can be made that they are victims of circumstance, having had an upbringing in an environment that encourages Islamic fanaticism. Walker, on the other hand, plainly chose to abandon his country and join its enemies.

"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists," President Bush said in his historic Sept. 20 speech. Helen Thomas, it appears, would have Bush add a qualification: ". . . unless you come from a respectable, middle-class American family." If we coddle our domestic enemies while killing our foreign ones, we will deserve a bit of the world's scorn.

Village Voice vs. CNN  http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0201/cotts.php

Remember when critics on the left were bewailing John Ashcroft's supposed attack on civil liberties? Now Cynthia Cotts of the Village Voice is going a step further. It seems the First Amendment is a threat to civil liberties. Cotts blasts CNN for airing an interview with John Walker, saying that the network's free and vigorous reporting displays "the power of media to indict a man more efficiently than any prosecutor."

"He hasn't talked to a lawyer, but he's already a scapegoat who can be spit upon and molded into anything you want him to be," Cotts complains. "Welcome to the latest weapon in the war on terror: the media tribunal."

Cotts's column also includes this paranoid aside:

*** QUOTE ***

Certain unsavory aspects of the story have been downplayed. For example, CNN shows from the night of December 19 offered many interesting details about the Walker tape. But on the Lexis-Nexis database, which carries CNN transcripts, the December 19 transcripts of Larry King Live and NewsNight With Aaron Brown are conspicuously missing. A fluke?

*** END QUOTE ***

CNN, Cotts implies, is trying to suppress Brown and King guests who called into question whether Walker is guilty of treason. Well, this wasn't a very successful censorship job, seeing as how both transcripts are available on  CNN's Web site  http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2001.12.19.html .

Our Friends the Saudis  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011230/ts/attack_saudi_dc_1.html

Crown Price Abdullah is urging Arab and Muslim leaders to denounce terrorism. "It is the duty of all Muslims in these circumstances to condemn all terrorist acts, without ambiguity," he said in Oman. Now he tells us. But Abdullah also said that Muslims should "demonstrate the vast and clear difference between terrorism and legitimate national struggle for the sake of self determination." Translation: Murdering Jews in Israel is hunky-dory.

Another Saudi view comes from  Khaled Al-Maeena  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=11625 , editor of the English-language Arab News. Here's his defense of the Saudis' hate-instilling religious schools:

*** QUOTE ***

Charles Whitman, the university student who climbed up the university tower in Texas in 1966 with an arsenal of weapons, and then killed 17 of his fellow students and teachers and injured many more, was not a product of Saudi schools. The Columbine school massacres were committed by schoolboys who did not receive their primary education in Riyadh. The followers of Charles Manson, who believed the latter was God and blindly obeyed his orders to go on a killing spree, were not educated in Dhahran. Timothy McViegh did not attend a madrassa. The Una bomber [sic] was neither a student nor a professor at a Saudi university. The thousands who accepted without question orders given by Rev. Jim Jones to commit suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, on Nov. 18, 1978, were not educated in Hofuf.

Scenes From the 'Legitimate National Struggle'  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/31/LatestNews/LatestNews.40864.html
 
A senior Palestinian Authority official "reportedly recently tried to convince Fatah military wing Tanzim operatives in Nablus to give themselves up and enter PA jails in order to bluff US and European observers," the Jerusalem Post says, picking up an Israel Radio report. "The PA official reportedly offered $3,000 to anyone willing to spend a month in PA detention in lieu of Hamas of Islamic Jihad terrorists."

An  Associated Press  http://www.winonadailynews.com/news/4world.php  dispatch notes that Leila Khaled, who "hijacked two airliners in 1969 and 1970 for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine," is now a member of the Palestinian Parliament.

Our Friends the Pakistanis  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2001/12/item20011230112450_1.htm

Afghanistan's interior minister says that Osama bin Laden is moving back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Australia's ABC News reports. "The fact that there has not been any reaction and that (bin Laden) has not been arrested, indicates that he is somehow being supported by the Pakistani ISI," says Yunis Qanuni, referring to the Inter-Services Intelligence agency.

Yikes!  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,3-2001605798,00.html

Tensions are high between Pakistan and India in the wake of this month's terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi. Both countries have nuclear weapons, and although India has a "no first use" policy, it "boasted yesterday that it would survive a first strike by a Pakistani atomic weapon, but that its neighbour would be wiped out in a swift nuclear counter-attack," the Times of London reports.

The New York Times'  William Safire  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/31/opinion/31SAFI.html  argues that the Bush doctrine--"whenever a government offers safe haven to terrorists, it ceases to be sovereign"--requires America to take India's side: "Whatever the merits of the Kashmir dispute, India is right to demand that President Pervez Musharraf crack down on the terrorist network operating out of Pakistan 'or else.' The U.S. owes Musharraf plenty for his help against the Taliban in the face of hot internal opposition, but we owe the new antiterror principle more."

Needed: More Missiles  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/wirq30.xml

"A shortage of cruise missiles has thrown plans for a full-scale strike on Iraq into disarray," London's Daily Telegraph reports. "Strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 and Kosovo two years ago virtually exhausted the US supply. The number of conventional [non-nuclear] air launched cruise missiles left within the inventory is believed to be fewer than 30." But the Telegraph quotes a Pentagon spokesman: "The military chiefs are aware of the situation and measures are in place to fix it."

Stupidity Watch  http://www.uscatholic.org/2002/01/cov0201.htm

This flight into mindless moral equivalence by Farid Esack, a South African Islam scholar, needs no comment:

*** QUOTE ***

I see it as a clash between two religious fundamentalisms. On the one side you have the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the actions we have witnessed. All that clearly represents the fanaticism of a religious fundamentalism.

On the other side of the conflict we are dealing with another religious fundamentalism, one that is not generally recognized as such. The Buddhist theologian David Loy has described faith in the free market as a religion, a religion with a transcendent god, a god that is worshiped and that its adherents have a deep yearning to embrace and to be at one with--and that god is capital.

It also has a theology in the form of economics, a fundamentalist ideology that excludes all others. Its cathedrals are the shopping malls, and there is paradise or the promise of paradise for those who get on board. It is the fastest growing religion in the world today.

If you look at the language of your president, his notion of absolute evil and complete abhorrence, as well as Osama's language of complete abhorrence, neither recognizes the possibility of any grace on the other side. Both espouse very hardened kinds of fundamentalisms.

I don't think that Bush is the problem, but neither is Osama solely the problem. It's these fundamentalisms and what gives rise to them that are the crucial issue.

Is the Norwegian Nobel Committee Reading This?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28267-2001Dec26.html

"The United Nations quashed an investigation earlier this year into whether U.N. police were directly involved in the enslavement of Eastern European women in Bosnian brothels," the Washington Post reports. Boy, we'd hate to hear what the Nobel Peace Prize losers are up to.

Two Americas  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/29/freedom.float.ap/index.html

The Associated Press reports that 59-year-old Madalenna Lai, who came to America in 1977 as a Vietnamese refugee, sold her house to raise $100,000, with which she built a float that will appear in tomorrow's Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Calif. "Her 35-foot long, 18-feet wide float will carry a simple message: 'Thank you America and the world.' "

What a contrast with  Nikkita Gardner  http://fyi.cnn.com/2001/fyi/teachers.ednews/12/28/young.people.ap/index.html , a junior at Northern Illinois University, quoted in another AP dispatch. She says: "I think a lot of minorities feel like 'Why should we fight? What has our country done for us?' "

Heavy Metal Poisoning  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/arts/music/27ANTH.html

The New York Times (link requires registration) reports that these have been tough times for  Anthrax  http://anthrax.com/ --not the germ but the heavy-metal band: "Slowly emerging from the Get What You Asked For file, Anthrax, whose members once reveled in how coolly evil the band sounded, has been humbled by its ironic association with terrorism, even as many of its older records have been selling at double their usual, albeit modest, pace--perhaps the first time that a biological attack has prompted a spike in heavy-metal album sales." Given al Qaeda's reported interest in chemical weapons, we'll bet  Poison  http://www.poisonweb.com/  ("the No. 1 glam-metal band of all time," according to VH1) is getting a bit nervous.

So Long, Rudy  http://city-journal.org/html/12_1_in_prospect.html

City Journal editor Myron Magnet pays tribute to New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who turns the reins over to Michael Bloomberg tomorrow:

*** QUOTE ***

Giuliani's biggest idea was that human affairs are not governed by vast, impersonal forces but by individual decisions. New York was of course governable--provided you had the will and vision to do the governing. You couldn't shrug, turn your palms upward, and appeal to some abstraction over which you had no control--the nation's irresistible suburbanization, say, or the Internet's inevitable dissolution of the cities--to absolve yourself for failure. Assuming, as Giuliani assumed, that talented, entrepreneurial people would always like to live near one another for the electricity such closeness generates, he took responsibility for creating the conditions in which that could keep happening in the place proverbially paved with gold. And he succeeded.

*** END QUOTE ***

We came to New York in 1990--a few months after Giuliani lost his first race, to David Dinkins--and we can attest to Rudy's success. We haven't been mugged since Dinkins was mayor, and we don't at all miss the race riots that engulfed various New York neighborhoods on an almost regular schedule during the reign of Dinkins, who was elected as a "racial healer."

Although adulation for Giuliani seems almost universal today, especially after Sept. 11, he drew bitter opposition from a lunatic fringe that has some influence in the city. An example is this Dec. 27, 1999, piece by "artist"  Robert Lederman  http://www.openair.org/alerts/artist/nytour.html :

*** QUOTE ***

We do face a real terrorist threat in New York City but it's not from fundamentalists in turbans or bible belt militias. The main suspect resides in Gracie Mansion, has a taxpayer funded office in City Hall and lately hides out in his high-tech bunker in the World Trade Center. He depicts himself as an advocate of law and order while actually being the biggest lawbreaker in the entire City. While mouthing platitudes about the glories of liberty and free speech and the dignity of work, he uses 680 lawyers to subvert the Constitution, is an outright enemy of anyone's free speech but his own and has a view of work closer to a WWII forced labor camp than an actual job.

As the ball drops in Times Square on New Year's Eve let's hope we will be seeing the final curtain call in the career of Mayor Rudy Crueliani.

*** END QUOTE ***

Nor is this attitude limited to a few self-proclaimed "artists." We recall being at a party a couple of years ago where a professor at a prestigious New York university (not an Ivy League one, we hasten to add) expressed her desire to see the mayor assassinated.

Mayor-elect Bloomberg comes to office something of a question mark, a businessman with no government experience. It's hard to say what kind of mayor he'll be, but if he manages to inspire the same kind of deranged hate Giuliani did in the academic and artistic fever swamps, it'll surely be a sign of success.

Homelessness Rediscovery Watch: Et Tu, Tommy?

"If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation."-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

"Health and Human Services Secretary  Tommy Thompson  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41706,00.html  recognized National Homeless Persons' Memorial Day as he 'encouraged the nation to take the time to remember the millions of homeless individuals who don't have a warm bed, a nutritious meal, or a family to go home to this holiday.' Although the day has been marked by homeless activists since 1990, this is the first time the federal government has paid its respects. Even the bleeding heart Clinton administration never recognized it."--Steven Milloy, FoxNews.com, Dec. 27, 2001

Multilateralism Works  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/30/japan.kyoto/index.html

In a tribute to President Bush's stature as a world leader, Japan has "effectively abandoned the Kyoto Protocol," CNN reports. "Japanese industry groups have forced the government to drop mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto agreement, making it unlikely Tokyo will be able to meet its reduction targets, the Yomiuri newspaper said."

Red Alert  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/29/arts/design/29LIBE.html

Under the headline "A Tantrum Over Art in Memphis," the New York Times (link requires registration) reports that some conservative Tennesseans are outraged over a piece of public art:

*** QUOTE ***

At first, few noticed their five famous words--"Workers of the world, unite!"--inscribed among dozens of other quotations outside the gleaming new $70 million Memphis Central Library, which opened in November.

But then this phrase from the Communist Manifesto caught the eye of two county commissioners and a city councilman, and in these days of heightened patriotism a smoldering debate was ignited on a popular radio talk show, in the letters and opinion column of The Commercial Appeal of Memphis and in the three politicians' own correspondence and phone calls. . . .

For the directors of the library and the UrbanArt Commission, the semipublic agency that commissioned the sidewalk art in which the revolutionaries' words make an appearance, these patriotic stirrings miss the point. They point out that Marx and Engels take their turn on the library pavement alongside as varied a bunch as anyone could think of: the Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss, a Japanese crane, a W.C. Handy ode to Beale Street and dozens of other words, images and symbols that would not have fit into the ideology of the two Germans.

*** END QUOTE ***

The Times quotes Kenneth Jackson, a Columbia University historian, who likens the objecting citizens to Lloyd Binford, Memphis's official censor in the 1950s, who, the Times says, "kept the citizens from seeing movies with too much female flesh and too much interracial mixing." Says Jackson: "I'm hoping that Memphis is putting that more narrow view of the world in its own past. Politicians jousting about an imaginary enemy is not very productive."

Well, OK, the whole thing is kind of silly. Still, we have just one question. Suppose instead of a commie slogan, it was a Confederate flag among the various icons on the sidewalk, and instead of conservatives, it was blacks who were objecting. Would the Times and Ken Jackson mock them as a bunch of rubes throwing a "tantrum"?
