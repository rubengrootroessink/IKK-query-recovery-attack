Should we give this to our husbands???

                           CAKE or BED?

         A HUSBAND IS AT HOME WATCHING
         A FOOTBALL GAME  WHEN HIS WIFE
         INTERRUPTS, "HONEY, COULD YOU FIX THE
         LIGHT IN THE  HALLWAY?
         IT'S BEEN FLICKERING FOR WEEKS NOW,"
         HE LOOKS AT HER AND SAYS
         ANGRILY; "FIX THE LIGHT? NOW?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE A GE LOGO
         PRINTED ON  MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK SO!"
         THE WIFE ASKS, "WELL THEN, COULD YOU FIX
         THE FRIDGE  DOOR? IT WON'T CLOSE RIGHT."
         TO WHICH HE REPLIED, "FIX THE FRIDGE DOOR?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE
         WESTINGHOUSE WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD? I
         DON'T THINK SO."
         "FINE," SHE SAYS "THEN YOU COULD AT
         LEAST  FIX THE STEPS TO THE FRONT
         DOOR? THEY'RE ABOUT TO BREAK,"
         "I'M NOT A DAMN CARPENTER AND I DON'T
          WANT TO FIX STEPS," HE SAYS. "DOES
          IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE ACE HARDWARE WRITTEN
          ON MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK
          SO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. I'M GOING TO
          THE BAR !!!"
          SO HE GOES TO THE BAR AND DRINKS FOR A
          COUPLE OF HOURS. HE STARTS TO FEEL
          GUILTY ABOUT HOW HE TREATED HIS WIFE,
          AND DECIDES TO GO HOME AND HELP OUT.
          AS HE WALKS INTO THE HOUSE HE NOTICES
          THE STEPS ARE ALREADY FIXED. AS HE
          ENTERS THE HOUSE, HE SEES THE HALL LIGHT
          IS WORKING. AS HE GOES TO GET
          A BEER, HE NOTICES THE FRIDGE DOOR IS
          FIXED.
          'HONEY," HE ASKS, "HOW'D ALL THIS GET
          FIXED?"
          SHE SAID,
          "WELL, WHEN YOU LEFT I SAT OUTSIDE
          AND CRIED. JUST THEN A NICE
          YOUNG MAN ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG,
          AND I TOLD HIM. HE OFFERED TO DO ALL THE
          REPAIRS, AND ALL I HAD TO DO
         WAS EITHER GO TO BED WITH HIM OR BAKE A
          CAKE."
          HE SAID, "SO WHAT KIND OF CAKE DID YOU
          BAKE HIM?"

          SHE REPLIED, "HELLOOOOO.......DO YOU SEE
         BETTY CROCKER WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD?
         I DON'T THINK SO!"
