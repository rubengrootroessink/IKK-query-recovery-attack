Don,

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.
