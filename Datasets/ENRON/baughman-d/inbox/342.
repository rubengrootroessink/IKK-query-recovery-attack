Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

Adios,

Don C. Baughman Jr.
