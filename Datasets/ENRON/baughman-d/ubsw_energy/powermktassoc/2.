 January 29, 2002	 January 30-31, 2002	
This executive forum goes beyond the public policy pronouncements to confront the tough, practical issues of implementation. It will bring together executives from some of the few transmission-owning organizations and their bankers and consultants that have come to grips with these issues over many months prior to the December 15 deadline. They will identify solutions and discuss the best ways to proceed in the near- to mid-term.	In 2002 owners, grid operators, system users, and investors will be forced to make sense of the multitude of changes affecting transmission business. To chart a course toward value creation for transmission assets while steering around the rocky shores of these regulatory changes it will also be important to understand the sometimes conflicting agendas of FERC and state regulators.
