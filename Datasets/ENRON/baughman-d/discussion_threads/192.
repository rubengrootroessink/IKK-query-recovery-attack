>  GOD BLESS TEXAS
>
>  It seems a man in Topeka, Kansas, decided to write
> a  book about
>  churches  around the country.   He started by
> flying to San Francisco,
>  and started  working east from there. He went to a
> very large church
>  and began taking photographs, etc. He spots a
> golden telephone on a
>  wall and is intrigued with a sign which reads
> "$10,000 a minute."
>  Seeking out the pastor he asks about the phone and
> the sign.  The
>  pastor answers that this golden phone is, in fact,
> a direct line to
>  Heaven and if he pays the price he can talk
> directly to God. He thanks
>  the pastor and continues on his way.  As he
> continues to visit churches
>  in Seattle, Boise, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee,
> New York,
>  Atlanta, and on around the United States, he finds
> more phones,
>  with the same sign, and the same answer from each
> pastor.  Finally,
>  he arrives in Texas.  Upon entering a church in
> Austin, lo and behold,
>  he sees the usual golden telephone. But THIS time,
> the sign reads
>  "Calls: 25 cents." Fascinated, he requests to talk
> to the pastor.
>  "Reverend, I have been in cities all across the
> country and in each
>  church I found this golden telephone, and have been
> told it is a
>  direct line to Heaven and that I could talk to God,
> but, in the other
>  churches the cost was $10,000 a minute.  Your sign
> reads 25 cents
>  a call.  Why?"   The pastor, smiling benignly,
> replies,
> "Son, you're in Texas now, it's a local call."
