1) When using the "loss matrix", use Source and Sink.

2)  MAPP will consider placing examples of tags on the wed site.  I don't 
expect this to happen soon so my suggestion would be to work directly w/ MAPP 
personnel associated w/ this project :    Tom White 651-632-8407 ,  Bill 
Tate  651-632-8403 or Bill Kunkel  651-632-8573.

3)  Don't worry yourself about "sink" scheduling participant.  JUST REMEMBER, 
THE SOURCE or POR is the scheduling participant responsible for our Schedule 
F requests.
