re: sailing trip.

we are watching the weather forecast closely.  hoping we can avoid rain.
if it looks to be too shitty, the trip may have to be canceled. may be a
last minute decision.  be forewarned.

Something we really need is a gas-fueled camping lantern.  Reid claims
to not have one & neither does Tom Booth (by the way, Booth is going
too).  Do you have one?  That would be something you could bring.  We
need it to see at night in the cabin & whatnot so we can play trivia or
cards or whatever.

I'll have this thing drafted for Rudy soon.

Marc,

Thanks for creating this document for me!  Rudy says he will take us out
to
supper at a nice joint, next week sometime.  If your paralegal needs any
additional information, drop me a note and I will get it.  The following
is
the necessary data:

Gift Declaration

"I Yolanda Herrera,"the Benefactor", give my son  Rudy Acevedo,"the
Beneficiary", the Property on 1216 and 1218 Tulane St. (** possibly
extraneous ** The reason for me giving my son the property is that I
will
be that I can no longer afford to pay the mortgage.)  The Property,
approximately 6,000 sq. ft., currently has a duplex which is identified
as
1216 and 1218 Tulane St., in the Heights Subdivision, North of Downtown
Houston, Texas. This is a pure gift and no money will exchange hands.
The
effective date is January 25, 2001.  The Beneficiary assumes all
ownership
responsibility and liability of said Property."

(Identified spaces for  benefactor, beneficiary, two witnesses and a
Notary
Public)

Thanks again,

SnAKeBiTE

PS  We need to get our ducks-in-a-row regarding whom is acquiring which
supplies for the sailing trip!
