Good Day,

You may be aware that the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission=20
(TNRCC)
has developed a Mass NOx Emissions Trading program for the Houston-Galvesto=
n=20
nonattainment area (HGA) to fulfill its requirements in meeting EPA=01,s ai=
r=20
quality standards.  Targeted sources are those that emit 10 tons per year o=
r=20
more in the HGA.   Though this program will be tailored to meet the region=
=01,s=20
needs it will likely share characteristics of other Cap and Trade emissions=
=20
trading programs such as the Title IV SO2 acid rain program, the OTC NOx=20
program, and the RECLAIM program.

At the request of a number of HGA proposed program participants, Cantor=20
Fitzgerald is conducting a short survey of participants in the Mass Emissio=
ns=20
Trading Program.  In exchange for your completion of this survey we will=20
provide you with its findings.  Results will be tabulated, aggregated, and=
=20
included in a NOx TRADING PROGRAM MARKET STUDY, which Cantor Fitzgerald=20
intends to present to participants at an interactive seminar (date yet to b=
e=20
established).  We will notify participants by fax when a date has been chos=
en.

ALL SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE WILL BE KEPT STRICTLY CONFIDENTIA=
L.=20
PLEASE FAX BACK YOUR COMPLETED SURVEY TO 415-296-9582 NO LATER THAN FEBRUAR=
Y=20
9, 2001.

We believe the information we gather will be beneficial to both potential=
=20
buyers and sellers of HGA NOx Emission Allowances, and we encourage you to=
=20
take part.

If you have any questions please call 1-800-228-2955 and speak to Laurie Ga=
ge=20
on ext 11.
We welcome any extra input you may wish to provide.

Thank you,

Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services  800.228.2955
