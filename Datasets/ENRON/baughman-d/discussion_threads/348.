Don,

Hey, how's it going?  Gone fishing lately?  I talked to Kayne earlier today 
about a posting this guy is interested.  Kayne tells me you are the man with 
the opening.  I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look 
at.  Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position.  I 
explained to him generally what the position is about, but things have 
changed.  He says he talked to Larry Campbell also. In fact, Larry might have 
talked to you about him already.  I haven't worked with him before, so I 
can't specifically vouch for his work ability (Larry can fill you in better 
in that area), but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get 
along with...(team player).  Also, he is an internal employee.   Attached 
below is his resume.  

John

John, I am interested in the ENA East Power Service DE Trader position 
currently being posted under Kayne Coulter.  I was hoping you could speak 
with him about my interest and forward my resume.  Let me know what you 
think.  Thanks, Jay
