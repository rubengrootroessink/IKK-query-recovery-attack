KISS - KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID.  Since we are not that smart over here in the 
hourly group I took it upon myself to make something as easy as OATI even 
easier.  It seems that every time I log on lately I get booted off.  I know I 
ain't doin nothin but it is still very frustratin so I did some thinkin and 
labeled all da desk with their own Enron Oati address.  If you look to your 
far left screen, notice how I made this simple for us, you will find an Enron 
label i.e. Enron 2.  This means your user id is Enron 2 and your password is 
8ball2. For those of you who don't know what I just typed or if I am not 
smart enough to explain it correctly let me try this way.  

Where I sit in da window I be Enron1 8ball1
Where Dandy Don sits he be Enron2 8ball2
Where Jumpin Juan sits he be Enron3 8ball3
Where Mumblin Miguel sits he be Enron4 8ball4
Where Roadhouse Rudy sits he be Enron5 8ball5
Where lunchpail John David sits he be Enron6 8ball6 
Where primetime Pat sits he be Enron7 8ball7
Where junkyard Jester sits he be Enron8 8ball8
Where mansen Maxfield Mayeaux sits he be Enron9 8ball9
Where chicken bone Chad sits he be Enron 10 8ball10
Where new man Narsimha sits he be Enron11 8ball11
Where Ricky Ricardo sits and I guess maybe Tom May or Batman or Maybe Mark 
Dana Davis sits I don't know who sits there now well you know the desk in 
front of Pimpin Presto's office it be Enron12 8ball12
Where Bustin Buck O 5 sits he be Enron13 8ball13 how ironic
Where you always save the best for last because I am from Florida and my shit 
don't stink Steponovitch he be Enron 14 8ball14 

I hope all you morons can get this little task right I know it is asking alot.
Any questions please refer to the Northeast.
