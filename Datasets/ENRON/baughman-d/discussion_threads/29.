Do you know how your salary and benefits rate?

The results of the Association for Financial Professionals' (AFP) 12th Annual 
Compensation Survey are now in and we have created a special summary report -

members of AFP and
The Financial Executives Networking Group (FENG), an AFP sponsored networking 
and exchange organization.
