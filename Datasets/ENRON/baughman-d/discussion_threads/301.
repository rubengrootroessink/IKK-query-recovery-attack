Don, 


Just wanted to say thanks for talking with me yesterday, it was a pleasure 
meeting you.  I appreciate your advice on the matter and keeping everything 
confidential.  

Thanks, 

G. Britt Whitman


I'll try to pass along a picture of the rainbow I caught last winter, 
however, you may want to check out www.grtu.org for information on fishing 
the Gaud.  Thanks, again.
