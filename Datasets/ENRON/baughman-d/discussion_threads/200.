too many tardies and we'll keep you after school!

seriously, you're doing great, Don. Thanks for everything--including
TVA/ComEd indic & trades. We changed TVA methodology to include anything
sinking at the hub and moving through THAT SINKS IN SERC. Hope that works
for ya; let me know if not!!

you got any influence over the ERCOT guys? when the dust settles, we'd love
to get their trades & indic. I hear there's cuts and outages--could we get
yesterday's hourly from a check out guy or a scheduler, maybe, or Russell
B.?

Thanks--you da power man!
