Subject: Miles City DC Tie Policy - Updated 01/30/2001


Dear MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers,

The Miles City DC Tie Policy has changed as of January 30, 2001.

Effective 12:00 Noon, 01/31/2001

The Policy for submitting requests for transmission service to the
WAUW.MPCO, WAUW.WACM service points under MAPP Schedule F:

Until further notice, the following policy affects requests for transmission
service to the subject service points submitted between 12:00:00 noon and
12:05:00 p.m. Central Time shall be observed.

If more than five (5) requests are submitted by the same Transmission
Customer or group of Affiliated Transmission Customers within the specified
time period to either one of the service points then all such requests shall
be considered as invalid.

MAPP will set the status of all such invalid transmission requests to
INVALID.   (For example, Six requests to WAUW.MPCO submitted between Noon
and 12:05 p.m. by the same Transmission Customer or group of Affiliated
Transmission Customers would have ALL (6) set to INVALID.

In addition the policy is posted under the MAPP Schedule F OASIS page, and
then click on OASIS Business Practices.

The URL below will also take you there:

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have any further
questions.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator
