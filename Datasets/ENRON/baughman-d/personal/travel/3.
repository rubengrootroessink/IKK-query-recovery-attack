Hola cabrones,
Ok, aqui esta el plan! Due to some very important people dragging their bum=
s things have changed slighty. We will now be going to Playa del Carmen. Ma=
ny of us have been there before. It is a great place and well situated. The=
 hotel is called the Rui Playa and the price is $585.00 smackeroos all incl=
usive. It is a fun jet package I found through Way to Go Travel agency here=
 in town. It is a very nice place and I urge everyone going to look at the =
funjet travel site and check it out. There is two people to a room and we c=
an work out when we get down there who's bunking with whom. Again the dates=
 are leaving Thursday September 6th returning Sunday the 9th.  Please call =
Elizabeth at Wat to Go Travel at 713-467-2262 and work out paying. They can=
 either send you the ticket or you can pick it up. Don and I have already r=
eserved our places and I have left a list of those that have confirmed to m=
e with Elizabeth. They are as follows. My! cell phone is 281-450-6115 pleas=
e call me for anything. If I left anyone out please inform me all we need t=
o do is give her the names. For those of you who may have to cancel I sugge=
st buying the ticket insurance it's only $35. Please do this asap because s=
ure as shit the prices just like morning wood will rise again. =20
