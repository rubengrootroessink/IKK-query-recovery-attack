A man boards an airplane and takes his seat. As he
settles in, he glances up and sees a very beautiful
woman boarding the plane.

He soon realizes she is heading straight towards
his seat. Lo and behold, she takes the seat right
beside his. Eager to strike up a conversation, he
blurts out "Business trip or vacation?"

She turns, smiles and says, "Business. I'm going to
the annual "Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."

He swallows hard. Here is the most gorgeous woman he
has ever seen sitting next to him and she's going to a
meeting for nymphomaniacs. Struggling to maintain his
composure, he calmly asks, "What's your business role
at this convention?"

"Lecturer", she says. "I use my experience to
debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality."

"Really", he says, "what myths are those?"

"Well", she explains, "one popular myth is that
African American men are the most well endowed when,
in fact, it's the Native American Indian who is most
likely to possess that trait.

Another popular myth is that French men are the best
lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.
However, we have found that the best potential lover
in all categories is the Southern Redneck."

Suddenly the woman becomes a little uncomfortable and
blushes.

"I'm sorry", she says. "I shouldn't be discussing
this with you.

I don't even know your name!"

"Tonto", the man says, "Tonto Goldstein. But my
friends call me Bubba."
