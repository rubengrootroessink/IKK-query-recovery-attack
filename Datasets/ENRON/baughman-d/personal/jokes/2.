>  First, I want to pass on my condolences to the  people of New York
and
>  all Americans that are hurting in this  tragic time. You can rest
assured
that anything and everything that can be  done to assure the safety of our
country will be done. This is the greatest  country in the world and we will
get through this trying time. Now is the  time for all people to set aside
our petty differences and show the world  that no one or no thing can destroy
the fortitude of the American  people.

>  To the people responsible for Tuesday's tragedy, I  say this: Are
you
>  fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your  heads wrapped too
tight?
>  Have you gone too long without a bath?  Do you not know who you
are
fucking with?
>
>  Americans  are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other
every day.
We will  relish that opportunity for new targets for our  aggression.
>
>  Have you forgotten history? What happened to  the last people that
started
fucking around with us? Remember the little  yellow bastards over in Japan?
We slapped them all over the Pacific and  roasted about 2 million of them in
their own back yard. That's what we in  America call a big ass barbecue. Ever
seen Texas on a map? Ever wonder why  it's so big? Because we wanted it that
way, Mexico started jacking around  with the Alamo and now they cut our
lawns. England? We sent them packing. Ask  your buddy Saddam about fucking
with the good 'ole USA. The only reason he  got away the first time is
because it's too hard to shoot someone when you're  doubled over laughing at
them. Our soldiers aren't trained to laugh and shoot  at the same time. Now
he couldn't stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over  his shitty little
country.
>
>  Trust us, Afghanistan will  end up a giant kitty litter box. Go
ahead and
try to hide, Bin Laden.  There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high
enough that's going to keep  your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every
inch of the country that  harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and
even smells like he was  there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on
people that have pissed us off  in the past.
>
>  This is America. We kick ass. This is what we  do. Go ahead and
laugh
now,but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke  your sorry asses.
>
>  God bless  America!
