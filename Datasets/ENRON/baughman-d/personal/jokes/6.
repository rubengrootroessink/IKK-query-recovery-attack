I got my buddies phone number for the DJ  services.  He said that they do a lot of weddings.  He also said he is  open that date.  I would also appreciate if you talked to him because he is  cool about playing the crawfish boil.  Here is his number.
 
Lash LaRue (he is a coon-ass)
281-821-4936
281-821-2329
 
Need anything else let me know.
 
Thanks,
