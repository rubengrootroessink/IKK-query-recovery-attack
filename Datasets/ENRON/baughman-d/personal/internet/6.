   1. Artist of the Month - Ray Wylie Hubbard
      Written by Richard Skanse

  The guitar had seen better days when Ray Wylie Hubbard happened
  upon it. It was an old Regal -- far from a top of the line brand
  even its day -- but surely it deserved better than this: reduced
  to a planter in the back corner of a little store somewhere in
  Arkansas. "They had plants in it," Hubbard laughs, "because the
  whole bottom part of it was curled up and gone because it'd been
  washed away in a flood." Nonetheless, Hubbard thought it was
  pretty neat, and when the shop owner asked him if wanted it,
  he said yeah. The owner shipped it to Hubbard, who with the help
  of a friend brought the instrument back to life.

  "I'll be amazed if the thing's not incredible," marvels Hubbard
  over the phone from his log cabin home in Wimberley.  "Regals were
  kind of the bottom end of guitars back then, pretty cheap, but it's
  funky -- it's real warm and it's got a great neck on it. It had to
  have belonged to a blind musician, because on the neck there are
  these notches on the third, fifth, seventh and ninth fret, and the
  only thing we could figure out was that if you were blind that way
  you would know what fret you were on. I'm getting ready to paint the
  top of it black and put a rose decal on it, and then it will be done."

  Hubbard is a man who knows a thing or two about remarkable
  resurrections. After a wild run through the heyday of the Austin-based
  progressive country movement of the Seventies, during which time he
  penned the immortal outlaw anthem, "Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother"
  and performed at the front of a reckless outfit dubbed the Cowboy
  Twinkies, Hubbard hit the brakes at the beginning of the Eighties
  and spent eight years re-evaluating not only his career but more
  importantly, his life. Inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan's successful
  eradication of his drug and alcohol addictions, Hubbard followed suit
  and returned in 1992 with the independently released Lost Train of
  Thought. The excellent Loco Gringo's Lament came two years later,
  with the increasingly sophisticated and poetic Dangerous Spirits,
  a cracklin' live album, and 1999's devilishly good Crusades of the
  Restless Nights following in short order. His winning streak continues
  this month with the release of the Gurf Morlix-produced Eternal and
  Lowdown, a gritty, bluesy collection of songs that plays like an
  aural map down the rough and tumble road to redemption and second
  chances. In another life, not too long ago, Hubbard might have been
  written off as a one-hit-wonder. Albums like Eternal and Lowdown
  prove otherwise, marking him as a Texas songwriter on the order of
  Townes Van Zandt and Butch Hancock. You better believe Hubbard belongs
  in that company -- every bit as much as that funky old Regal guitar
  deserved to be rescued an ignoble retirement and thrust back to work
  in the hands of a serious song poet.

   4. Honorary "Lone Stars" - Jason Boland And The Stragglers

   "That's right. You're not from Texas, but Texas wants you anyway."
                                                       - Lyle Lovett

   Well, the "Boys From Oklahoma" do it again. This time its the Stragglers
   with their new release "Truckstop Diaries"

   The CD starts off with the title cut which gets its name from the
   eclectic mixture of folk that are seen at your average roadside
   attraction. Far from a just a collection of trucker tunes, the CD
   ranges from country, honkytonk, roots rock, bluegrass, spanish,
   and gospel. Take a listen for yourself and get "Behind The Music"
   with our audio webcast including Boland's commentary on the new CD along
   with song samples.
