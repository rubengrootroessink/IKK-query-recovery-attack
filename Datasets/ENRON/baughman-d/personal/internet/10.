Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ? ?

 
 

Dear continental.com customer,



We're Changing To Serve You Better
This Thursday evening April 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our 
web reservations system, eService Online.  This marks the start of an 
exciting new beginning as the reservations platform is 100% provided by 
Continental.

We're making this change because our current product, while good, will not 
provide us with the flexibility in the future to offer the features that will 
make travel arranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience 
for you.


Here's What You Need To Know:

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username (dbaughm) and password, has 
been transferred to the new version of eService Online.  To protect your 
personal information, credit card information has not been transferred.  You 
will need to update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. 
If you want to keep a copy for your records, you will need to print them 
prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not affect the status of any 
previous reservations and tickets, but you can not view them in the new 
eService Online.  

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to 
reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password 
each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here.  You are 
strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging 
process. 

24 Hour Hold Option
To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the "Hold for 
24 hours" option.  The "Hold" option will not be available between April 10 
and April 12.


Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets 
(eTickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by 
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West 
Airlines (CO2000-2349). 

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the 
seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating. 

Pricing 
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your 
selection of either "Search By Lowest Fares" or "Search By Schedule."  We 
also added a gold star to denote "continental.com promotional fares," so you 
know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare. 

Customer Service 
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now 
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services. 

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new 
version may not, on the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These 
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for 
the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  
Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

Overall, we're confident that you will appreciate the changes and 
improvements and look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,
Continental Airlines Inc.
