Paul Harvey Writes:

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.

For my grandchildren, I'd like better.  I'd really like for them to
know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat
loaf sandwiches.  I really would.

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn
honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the
car.
And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are
sixteen.

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your
old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something
you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle
of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you
because he's scared, I hope you let him.

When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag
along, I hope you'll let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On
rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your
driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with
someone as uncool as your Mom.

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one
instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add
and subtract in  your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on
a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory
soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove
and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a
beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your Uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy
during the holidays.  I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a
baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and
kisses you at Christmas timewhen you give her a plaster mold of your hand.

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work
and happiness.  To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I
die before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.

Send this to all of your friends.  We secure our friends, not by
accepting favors, but by doing them.

Paul Harvey

When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the answer,
compared to 17% of Stanford University seniors.
What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it,
The rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?
Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the
answer.
P.S.  You wont believe this, but this really does give you the
answer!!!!
