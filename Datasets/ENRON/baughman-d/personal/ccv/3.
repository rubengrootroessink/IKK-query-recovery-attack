LAW 1: Golf should be given up at least twice per month.  
LAW 2: All vows taken on a golf course shall be valid only 
until the  sunset. 
LAW 3: The more expensive (and newer) the golf ball, 
the  greater its attraction to water. 
LAW 4: No matter what causes a golfer  to muff a shot, all his 
playing partners must solemnly chant, "You looked  up," or 
invoke the wrath of the universe. 
LAW 5: Golf balls never  bounce off of trees back into play. 
If one does, the tree is breaking a law  of the universe and 
should be cut down. 
LAW 6: Golf balls from the  same "sleeve" tend to follow one 
another, particularly out of bounds or into  the water (See 
Law 3). 
LAW 7: No matter how bad your last shot was,  the worst 
is yet to come. 
LAW 8: A golfer hitting into your group  will always be bigger 
than anyone in your group. Likewise, a group you  accidentally 
hit into will consist exclusively of 300-pound gorillas.  
LAW 9: Your best round of golf will be followed almost 
immediately  by your worst round ever. The probability of 
the latter increases with the  number of people you tell 
about the former. 
LAW 10: Sand is a living  entity, and must be treated with 
kindness and respect. If it isn't, how do  you explain the 
way it always works against you? 
LAW 11: Golf carts  always run out of juice at the farthest 
point from the clubhouse.  
LAW 12: The last three holes of a round will automatically 
adjust  your score to what it really should be.
