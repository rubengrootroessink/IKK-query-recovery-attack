Please call the Galveston County Health District Mosquito Control tomorrow.
The number is 281 534-2531.  With all of the standing water, we already have
a problem with the large swamp mosquitos.

To highlight tonight's meeting, there were discussions about coming up with
an emergency plan for our neighborhood.  One item suggested was a list of
available resources for our neighborhood, both from government and from
neighbors (boats, generators, pumps, fans, etc.) and another was coming up
with a synopsis of what happened to the neighborhood last week.  I will
forward information to you on these things as I receive them.  There were
many concerns voiced and a lot of good suggestions.  We will meet in July to
have a formal neighborhood meeting.

Another upcoming event will be a Clear Creek Environmental Foundation
clean-up.  They plan to start at Clear Creek Village and work up the creek.

This meeting took place on very short notice and many people could not attend
due to cleaning up their homes.  The board members are trying to talk with
all of the homewoners who had damage.  You may call or email any of the board
memebers if you have concerns or you may email me and I will gladly forward
your emails.

The email list now has about 100 addresses.  That meants that about 108 homes
do not get this information.  Please talk with your neighbors and make sure
that they are aware of the information you receive.  This sure is faster than
door to door flyers, but it is limited in its scope and readership.
