Subject: Fw: This Weekend 
This is a message I got from Joe yesterday about Saturday night.  It makes 
me no difference if ya'll want to go out for an evening on the town.  Sounds 
good to me.  Some of us are heading over to Roger Creager at Garden in the 
Heights Thursday evening.  I don't know if we really need to meet to discuss 
the weekend or not.  I am handling all of the food for the weekend and the 
only other issue is who is riding with who.  Jay is taking his Expedition. 
We are leaving from my house Friday afternoon.  So, Don, Travis and Gerald 
will be coming from the Clear Lake area and I guess are planning on riding 
together.  The question is do ya'll want to meet us at my house?  I have a 
map I can fax over or you can look up where we are staying on the internet 
and get directions.  The web-site is willowcreekranchtexas.com.  There are 
directions on the web-site.  Jay wants to meet tomorrow at the skeet range 
off of Westheimer if anyone is interested in doing that.  You can call him 
at 281-844-0071  that is his cell. number.  Please read the message below 
also. 
Scott
