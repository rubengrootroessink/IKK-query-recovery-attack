Hi Don,

How are you?  Mark told me that you had mentioned to him that I could send
my resume to you again regarding the analyst position.  Thank you very much
for offering to help again, I really appreciate it! I think the position
sounds very interesting and I would love to have the opportunity to speak
with someone about it.

I have attached my resume in Word 2000. Please feel free to contact me if
you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

Thanks again.

Christine Walton
