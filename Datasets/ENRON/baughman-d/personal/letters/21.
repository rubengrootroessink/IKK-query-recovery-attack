Pat Hallisey has volunteered to organize the events, circumstances and data
that occurred last week concerning the storm.  He has presented a very
thorough outline of  the document.  He is asking for comments from all of the
residents.  We do realize that many of the residents do not have time right
now to write their  experiences and many people are not receiving the emails.
 It is very important from an historical point of view that we do document
events so that presentations can be made on behalf of the residents at future
meetings and planning sessions.  Thank you. Mary G. Strickland

MESSAGE FROM PAT HALLISEY  --
Ok, Just as a starting point below I will list the beginning of an outline
for the Clear Creek Village view of Tropical Storm Allison.  I hope each of
you will add a section or sub-section to it and supply information.

If I understood Peggy Zahler correctly, I think what she asked for  a
perspective that would chronicle the events, circumstances and data that
occurred from Tuesday June 5-10, 2001 for the purpose of having a historical
perspective of how Tropical Storm Allison and its remnants effected Clear
Creek Village.

Please keep in mind this is only a beginning, all data can be sent to Pat
Hallisey, 2205 Acacia, 281-332-0157.  hallisey@wt.net or ccvevents@aol.com
or, Gerald Harris willyg52@aol.com
