Hello Everyone,
=20
This is in reference to this years Bocktoberfest in  Shiner another weekend=
 getaway. =20
(Like I need another  one)
=20
October 12,13 & 14th
=20
Below is a list of performers for this years  event.
=20
We are again going to rent an RV to drive to  Shiner again this year and wa=
nted to know who would all like to join  us.  We will be leaving in the RV =
on Friday afternoon/evening and be  driving down to Moulton (or maybe somew=
here else) to eat, drink and be merry  there on Friday evening.  Then we wi=
ll go to my Grandmother's house (she  doesn't live there any longer) to spe=
nd the night.  At the current time we  are planning on renting one RV.  The=
 RV will sleep 8 people and  the house sleeps 8 people.  There has been tal=
k/interest in maybe renting a  second RV.  Also for anyone not able to come=
 down on Friday they can meet  us on Saturday and stay over with us on Satu=
rday night again at my Grandmother's  and in the RV.  There are no close ho=
tels in the area and the few there are  have already been booked.  We have =
made this trip twice in the past and  both times it has been very enjoyable=
.  We are able to park the RV across  the road from the festival and this h=
as made it nice for everyone to just hang  out and enjoy the music from the=
re or go into the festival and still have a home  base to come back to.  An=
yway those of you who have attended in the past  you know the routine and t=
he new people, I say welcome.  Please don't  spread the word to far about t=
he trip because we definitely don't have room for  everyone. There=20
are a few more people invited than just the ones on  the above list.  Signi=
ficant others are invited.
=20
And now you ask the price for all this fun and  excitement?
=20
If wanting to participate in the RV ride-down and  keg beer on board along =
with some snacks the price is a cool $85 maybe  $90 a person for the entire=
 weekend.  That is with 8 people coming  along for the ride.  If just comin=
g down on Saturday and partying, hanging  out and spending the night the pr=
ice is whatever you want to pitch on how  much snacks and beer you feel you=
 consumed or just bring your own.  The RV  trip is the most fun.  I have ex=
perience. I know.  We may get two RV's  if enough interest.  In years past =
I have been able to come up with free  tickets.  This year may not be so ea=
sy.  Concert tickets are around  $20 apiece.  Beers inside are $3.00.  That=
 is why we like having our  own party it is a little cheaper on the other s=
ide of the fence.  We will  also cook Fajita's or something simple in the a=
fternoon.  Any questions let  me know.
=20
We would like to know something by the end of this  week or first of next a=
t the latest.
