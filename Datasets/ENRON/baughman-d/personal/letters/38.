Hola Hermano,

How are you? I have been busy ever since trying to get everything in order
to leave. I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until
I leave, not that I blame them. It even doesn't make me mad because I
haven't had time to think about it. Anyway the work has also been more
interesting in the last two months than the two before I left for holidays.

I now find myself in peculiar situation similar to maybe going off to
school. I am leaving somewhere where I have made a lot of close friends and
had heaps of great, and trying experiences and am preparing for the next
step in life, oh no a CAREER, ouch that hurts. I however am excited on where
this new road may lead me and as you know man I am ready to come home. I
sure wish you could have been here for the going a way party, it was so
fantastic, other than not getting laid. I am so tired of these foreign know
it all, fascist, snobby, anorexic, egotistical, meniacal, deceptive, nose
ring wearing, no dancing, big shoe sporting, tasteless,  putas! I really
can't wait to meet some nice Texas girls or someone with similar interest.

I miss you a lot too and can't wait to have some nice parties and dinners as
well, I am more of a budding Chef. My guitar playing is getting a little
better. So what's the scoop. Anything happening in work, relationship,
houseshopping, fishing hunting. So what's up there. Mom says you're working
like crazy and occasionally looking for a house. How's that going. I can
tell you, it never fails. No matter where I go I seem to run into decisions
all with the same gravity, I guess if there is third guarantee in life it is
decisions. If you haven't finished by the time I return I would like to help
you

I can't wait! I have had a great time here but I really am ready to return
home. I know now I never wish to permanenetly live outside of Texas. Anyway
I'm so busy packin and taking care of paperwork and contracts and bla bla
bla it takes all my time! My last day of work is Next Wednesday (28th) and
then I will travel and visit some friends for about three weeks. This
weekend, since I'm not at home for Mardi Gras I will go to visit a Thomas in
Cologne Germany and go to one of the greatest Karnival Celebrations in the
world. The following weekend my flatmate David and I are off to Rome and
then Budapest (Hungary). Then the last week (on my home) I will leave Zurich
on the 15th of March and stop off in Den Hague and Amsterdam (Holland) for 6
days to visit Natalie. Well I am not leaving for a while and will constantly
have acces to the internet so write back and let me know how things are
going. All the best on at work and on finding a house und so weiter. By the
way I am searching for some jobs there have you heard from anyone or can I
write to anyone?

Love ya bro,
Travis
