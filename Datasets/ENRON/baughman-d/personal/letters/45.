Everyone have a merry Christmas It has been a great year.  Our P&L stands at 
$4.2 million.  Our budget was $10 million at the start of the year, then it 
was changed to $5million when they took the 5% away from us.  After the slow 
summer and when doubt settled in on our ability to achieve our goal it was 
knocked down to $3 million.  However, when we proved that we were fighters 
and not quitters and soared right through the $3 million, the crawfish came 
along and knocked it up to $4 million and then up to $5 million.  Regardless 
of all the crawfish boils we have been invited to this year, the bottom line 
is that you never quit and I can say that I am DAMN proud of our group.  We 
have been given 4 different managers for this year.  We started with the 
infamous Jason Haile. He left in February because he had his doubts about us 
achieving our goal.  Then Mr. Mark Dana Davis took the interim until he was 
able to bring in Jeff King.   Jeff was with us from April until July and did 
a great job, he represented us well and knew how to bring out our strengths.  
In August we inherited Mitch Robinson.  We had to pack our bags and move into 
Mr. Robinson's neighborhood.  Mitch taught us the operation side of the 
utilities and we showed him that trading real time is not as easy as it 
looks.  Mitch also fought for us,  I was in several different meetings in 
which I saw him fight for us,  I know we had our differences but at the end 
of the day he really stood up for us.  He came to a conclusion that his 
skills and interest are dealing with assets.  Now going into the New Year we 
have been given a new challenge.  I would like to say that I strongly believe 
that we are and can stay at the top of the industry as the best.  In order to 
stay at the top we have to believe and become the best that we can be.  You 
never stay the same, you either get better or you slide down the hill.  
Everyone of us has an opportunity.  There are always going to be days that we 
feel like what in the HELL am I doing here.  However if you stay positive and 
take care of your responsibilities we will stay on top.  Patience, 
Perseverance, and Organization are our keys to success.  To keep from 
rambling I will close with this great philosophy.  Every one of us has 
talents and desires and they are all different.  We are still a team and 
always will be a team and to be a successful team we have to have  the utmost 
respect for one another and you have to take it upon yourself to not give any 
of your teammates a reason to not respect you. My only expectations are for 
you to give 100% and know your role.  If you do not know your role come see 
me.

Thanks and God Bless
Big Daddy
