Things are going well here. Lot's of credit events keeping us busy.

I plan on coming to Houston in summer 2002, hopefully we can do
some fishing or something. I will give you a call once I make plans.

Hope things stay in your favor with the merger.

Best regards,

Jeff L.

Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly
impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look
like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due
to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract,
about a month ago.

How is your gig?

Best wishes,
