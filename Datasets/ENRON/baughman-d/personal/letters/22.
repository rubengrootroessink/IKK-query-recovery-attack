Hey bro,
Please look at the list and let me know about anyone I missed, I have Reid and Mark working on it as well. Mainly include people from highschool, work and college i may have missed, as I am typeing I just though of about 10 more. Let me know the date by tomorrow b/c I want to start planning asap for both so in case I get a job I will have most of it done. By the way I decided to take unemployment, cool huh? I will keep you updated on everything, please take some time and put peoples numbers next to their names, you need to beam me you shit and this would be fine then you don't have to type it down. 
Hey have you talked with the lady at Enron yet?
see you later,
