Don and Shannon,

Congratulations to both of you on your engagement from the Snapkas.  We also
would like to welcome you to the Bay Area!  I am sure the neighbors do not
know what they are in for.  We are always looking for someone to drink with.
We can even call it dinner.  I hope things are going well with the
arrangements.  If you invite us over, we would love to pee in your pool.
Take care!

Gerald and Cindy
