Don,

What time are you getting married on September 22nd? Is the trip to Mexico
still on and if so, what is the date for that and who do I need to contact
for details? Also, do you have Travis's phone number so I can get a resume
from him to show to Duke Human Resources?

Sorry about the question barrage.
