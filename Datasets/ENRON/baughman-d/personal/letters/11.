Don't forget that it is August again and time to  renew those hunting license's.  We will be leaving to go to Mason on the  evening of Aug. 31st and hunting early that Saturday morning.  Just a  reminder to get your license before we leave on that Friday.  We are  staying at the Willow Creek Ranch homes.  I just wanted to let everyone  know so someone can remember where we are staying.
 
Also, Wednesday evening seems to be a good time for  Pizza and Beer at Kenneally's on Shepherd.  Around 7:00 p.m.  I will  see you there.  Well those of you who can make it.
 
Scott
