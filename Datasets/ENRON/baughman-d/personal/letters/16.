Is Travis going,as well?

We are planning on meeting up there that Friday afternoon and heading back
Monday morning.

No good fishing stories and I'm not sure what you mean by "Tricks"

I saw the new house the last time I was in town.

Talk to you later and have a good one.

Joe

   Just wanted to let you know that we are confirmed to hunt w' Jack Crouch
   out
   of Mason on Sat - Sept 1 and Sun - Sept 2.

   Please confirm within two weeks if you are definitely committed to the
   hunting trip or not.

   We already have a two cabins to stay in right on the Llano river and it
   is
   only about a 15 minute drive to Mason (which will certainly be nice).

   Later,

   Joe
