Just wanted to let you know that we are confirmed to hunt w' Jack Crouch out
of Mason on Sat - Sept 1 and Sun - Sept 2.

Please confirm within two weeks if you are definitely committed to the
hunting trip or not.

We already have a two cabins to stay in right on the Llano river and it is
only about a 15 minute drive to Mason (which will certainly be nice).

Later,

Joe
