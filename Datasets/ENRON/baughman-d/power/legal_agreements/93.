Dear Members-

As you are aware, MAPP has filed with the FERC to change its Line Loading
Relief Procedure to use the NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure for
curtailment of Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service and Network and
Native Load obligations.  This is to become effective when automation of the
Network and Native Loads obligation calculation is implemented.  The current
schedule for implementation of this automation is now July 16, 2001.  Please
inform the appropriate individuals in your organization of this schedule.

We will continue to update the Membership as we receive information from
NERC.


Sincerely,

Bill Head
Director of Transmission Operations
MAPPCOR
