Subject:=09ARTO Progress

A quick update on ARTO....

Since taking the reigns from Jeff we have been concentrating on getting a s=
eat at the table with ARTO to discuss day 2 congestion mgmt (CM).  We have =
been (tentatively) successful (i.e. we have a toe in the door but not a sea=
t at the table).

?=09Initially ARTO were not interested in pursuing a stakeholder process to=
 discuss market design issues. They held a stakeholder meeting in Columbus =
on 3/22 where we suggested that they set up a meaningful stakeholder proces=
s.  This was supported by a majority of stakeholders at the meeting.   Howe=
ver it appeared to fall on deaf ears.
?=09As a result of that meeting we assisted EPSA draft a letter to the ARTO=
 mgmt committee setting out our concerns and proposing a stakeholder proces=
s that if implemented would avoid us going to FERC (the threat was implicit=
 in the letter).
?=09ARTO held a second stakeholder meeting in Baltimore.  At that meeting t=
hey proposed a stakeholder process along the lines set out in the EPSA lett=
er (the Market Development Advisory Group will meet every two weeks to reac=
h concensus on day 2 CM).  We also suggested a tentative governance structu=
re and a way of ensuring that ARTO fully considered our input.  While it is=
 unclear whether ARTO are 'genuinely' seeking input from this group or tryi=
ng to appease FERC, the setting up of the process is a useful step for us. =
 We can use the process to attempt to gain concensus around a fully develop=
ed 2 day CM solution, propose this to ARTO and work with them on implementa=
tion by 12/15/2002.   If ARTO refuse to adopt it we should have a stronger =
case with FERC as we will be able to show the process, output and lack of c=
onsideration by ARTO.  I am sure that ARTO are aware of this so i am trying=
 to work out their angle, maybe they are being genuine (still it pays to be=
 a sceptic at this stage).
?=09To start building concensus around a day 2 CM solution i have asked a s=
mall group of stakeholders to assist us develop a framework (at this stage =
the small goup is Edison Mission, Constellation, Duke Energy, PG&E and Reli=
ant).  They are happy for us to take the lead on developing this framework =
(no prizes for anyone who guesses what that framework looks like) and to st=
art thinking about how we get wider concensus amongst stakeholders.

So some positive movement.  I am also opening up communications with ARTO m=
gmt committee members (have talked to Comed and started with Illinois Power=
 through Dynegy....Ron & I are trying to set up a second meeting with AEP m=
gmt) and Janine is setting up a roadshow so we can visit other interested p=
arties in the ARTO region over May/June.

A couple of other related points.  It would be useful to get in front of th=
e decision makers at Dynegy to see where they are at generally...there is s=
ome differing feedback from the people i know so it is not clear what their=
 corporate position is (i may need a hand here!).  This is reflected in the=
 second point...at the last ARTO stakeholder mtg we were told that ARTO had=
 to make a decision whether to select 'pay as bid' or 'single market cleari=
ng price' as the mechanism to determine price discovery.  We were told that=
 7 out of the 10 ARTO mgmt commttee preferred 'pay as bid'.  Anyway we argu=
ed for 'single market clearing price'.  We also suggested that transmission=
 owners should not make a decision that affected market participants.  We m=
anaged to convince a some stakeholder with our arguments and ARTO held a sp=
ot vote that recorded 3 for 'pay as bid', 9 for 'single market clearing pri=
ce and 9 'not enough info'....i have heard to ARTO took this into account a=
nd will leave it to stakeholders which again is a positive step for the pro=
cess. I strongly supported 'single market clearing price' whereas Dynegy wa=
s a strong proponent for 'pay as bid' but having talked to their people in =
Houston they say that that is not their position (its seems like they have =
the same problem as other large firms....).  So getting time with their dec=
ision makers would be useful.


I hope this update is useful, give me a call with any queries or feedback.

MR

Christi, could you forward this to the traders if you think it is useful fo=
r them.
