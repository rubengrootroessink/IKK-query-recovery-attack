We received this today and are working to see what solution we can come up with. Part of the solution may require a shorter billing period, possibly daily, but in all probability, weekly. Depending on what we can work out with ISO-NE we may require you to explore this possibility with NSTAR, CMP and UI and reach agreement to change the contracts accordingly, say until assignment, for example.
	
Will keep you posted as to what progress, if any, we can make in this regard. Any feedback on the likelihood that we could get agreement and the effect of asking for the change will be welcomed at this stage.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus
