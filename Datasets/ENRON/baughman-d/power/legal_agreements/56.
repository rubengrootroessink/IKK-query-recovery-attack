The list I have is years old.  Fortunately, the names in Deal Entry and Deal Blotter are alphabetical so you do not need to know the codes.  The power short codes are not consistent with the NERC codes so this would probably not help you.  Attached is a list of CPs with whom we deal.

Dean Laurent mentioned that you had a list of all counterparties with their corresponding Enpower acronym.  Please forward this list so that we on the hourly power desk can be sure to enter deals correctly in Enpower.  Thanks.
