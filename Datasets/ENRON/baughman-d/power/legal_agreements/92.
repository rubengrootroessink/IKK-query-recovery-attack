Subject:	MAPP implementation of NERC automated generation to load

 Mid-Continent Area Power Pool  (ER01-2207-000)

	MAPP, on behalf of its public utility members, notified the Commission on July 16, 2001 that the NERC 
automated generation to load process has been integrated into the current MAPP system.  MAPP submitted proposed 
amendments to Schedule F of its OATT implementing the NERC TLR procedures, to become effective July 16, 2001.

If you would like any further information on MAPP's filing, please let me know.
