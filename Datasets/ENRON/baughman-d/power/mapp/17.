Matt, Don, and Doug,

As you all probably know by now, the Fall APDA Conference will be held in Watertown, South Dakota from September 20-23.   WAPA is hosting the conference this fall and they have created a website:  www.geocities.com/apdaconferences.

The website contains agenda information, reservation materials, contacts, etc.  Please review and pass on to anyone I may have missed.  Don...I wasn't sure who you would want from your group to go, so please feel free to forward to your guys (the majority of people who attend this conference are hourly/daily traders).

Let me know if you have any questions.


Terri
