Met this guy at the MAPP/MAIN/SPP conference in Chicago.  Larry V. says they are on the credit watch list, but I thought you might want to check it out anyway.

Doug...thanks for the hospitality last Tuesday night at Pheasant Run...I
enjoyed hanging out with you and Mike.

On our conversation about trading around MAPP...our assets in the Chicago
area are in an excellent position to be accessible to MidAmerican and
Alliant, and if you'd like to have your spot traders start calling us on
our real-time desk at 800.848.3975 we'd welcome the calls.  Although I
think you may find some reluctance on your side to get done with us,
clearly we can supply odd lots and load-following schedules into MAPP...and
hopefully that gets us some leverage.  If you're willing to undertake
payables to us we're more than happy to accept them.

Thanks again.
