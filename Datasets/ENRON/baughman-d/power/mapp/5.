Repayment Procedure

Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/practices.html

Questions may be e-mailed to Tom White at the MAPP Center:
ts.white@mapp.org

Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the URL given above.

A copy of the revised section five of the policies and procedures document
is attached.
