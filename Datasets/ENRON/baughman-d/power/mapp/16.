Subject: Picnic


Well....surprise....surprise.....surprise.  Once again I haven't heard from
many people as to whether they are coming to the picnic or not, and the
ones I have heard from (for the most part) haven't made their hotel
reservations yet.  If you are coming, please give the hotel a call (309)
685-2556 and make sure you tell them you're with the "Electric Group"
otherwise they will scatter us around the hotel.  Granted, the hotel isn't
that large but having us all in the same general area will mitigate
complaints of noise.....
You only have until Aug. 23rd to get the special rate.

Even if you are not planning on attending but someone from your shop is,
please have them drop me an email to let me know.

I realize everyone has been pretty busy with the hot weather that decided
to settle in for a while, but it's getting ready to break and you will soon
have time to GET THIS DONE!

Once again, PLEASE let me know if you're showing up.....either that, or
don't expect to eat if you do show up.

Thanks
