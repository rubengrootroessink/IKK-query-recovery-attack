GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for Enron Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for Enron's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of Enron Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.
