John and Kevin,

In response to your counter offer of $77,500 plus $10,000 signing I must
admit it just makes it where I have to be money wise.  And ENRON is very
tempting to go work for, but I have to decline for now.  There are things
here in the works at ACES, (I am not at liberty to discuss right now) that
make it hard for me to leave for the summer months.  I have been promised a
lot of things recently, some before our interview and more since then, that
would make my jumping ship a little premature.  By the way, ACES does not
know about my interviewing with you and I perfer keeping it that way.  If
ACES does not deliver on what was promised, then I will be calling you
again!! .

I will keep the paper work just in case, and regardless of that - thank you
for the interview, it was a great experience!!! .


Michael Byrne
