Johnny,
I have attached my resume.  I wanted to add to it the Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) application projects that I have directly worked on that have exposed me to the RAC side of the business.  I am not sure if it was relevant, however, I felt it was an important part of my motivation and interest on the trading side of Enron's business in addition to my own career objectives.  Though I recognize I have no trading experience I am seriously interested in moving in this direction.
Please let me know if you need any more information.
Thank you.
Jeff Pena

Johnny,
I wanted to know if you might be able to share with me a little more info on the trading positions you have available.
The questions I have are :
Is there a job req. on the Working @ Enron website that would have a good job description of the available positions?
If not, what are the requirements for the position? Experience required?
Please feel free to contanct me at your earliest convenience.
Thanks,
