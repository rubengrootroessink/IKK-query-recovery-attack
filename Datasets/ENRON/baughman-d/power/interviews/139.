Don 
I want to thank you for passing my Resume to the appropriate person there. I will have a job interview tomorrow with Lydia Delgado (Human Resources) and Marc Dana Davis (not sure what department since Miss Delgado just mention "Trading").
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that another friend of mine is looking into Enron, and I mention him that you could have a position open in your area. He has worked with us for 2-3 years now, and I fully recommend him.
I will ask him to send you a copy of his resume, and I hope that you can help. 
I want to thank you again for your help. 
Sincerely, 
Jose C. Vulpes
