Hi Don,
Hope you were not effected by Allison this past weekend.  I was almost caught in it on Friday.  Kirit Purbhoo and I were up there with your guys and luckily we left in time.  Just as soon as we got off 45 (going North), they started to shut it down.  Anyway, it was still a close call. 

 I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how thankful I am to you and the guys (Joe, Reese & Steve).  By the way , Joe Errigo has given me permission to use him for reference.  It was a great opportunity to get some hands on training.  I really enjoyed the fast paced environment.  Now more than ever I am convinced that this is exactly what I want to do.  The opportunities which are available in your area (shift work and learning to trade and move power) is  very appealing to me and  I am eager to start.  Where I lack in experience, I more than make up for with ambition and dedication.  I can sincerely say that I will do whatever it takes to learn the position and learn it well.  I anxiously wait for an opportunity to interview with you and other managers on the 24 hour desk.   Hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam
