Don, 

Thanks for meeting with me to discuss a job opportunity on the Hourly Trading Desk.
I am still very interested in working in the department, so please keep me in mind
if the situation changes.  

I already have a good understanding of the power market and I am a very quick learner.  
So I know that I will pick up the information quickly.

This is just a suggestion - Could I spend some time in the group when it is slow, maybe an hour or two, so that 
I can learn more about the job duties? 

Thanks again,
Joe Capasso
