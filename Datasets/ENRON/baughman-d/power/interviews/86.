Don,

Larry Campbell had forwarded my resume to you. Attached please find my resume just in case you haven't had a chance to look it over.

 With your permission I would like to see the trading desk in operation. I am available this memorial weekend or in the evenings during the work week ,if that is ok with you.

		 


Thank You

KP
