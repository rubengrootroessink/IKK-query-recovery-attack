Don,

Thank you for having Mark and I over on Saturday.  We really enjoyed
ourselves and had a great time meeting everyone.

As we discussed Saturday, I have attached my resume (in Word 2000 format, if
your system requires another format please let me know).
I really appreciate you taking the time to review and forward my resume on.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me.


Sincerely,

Christine Walton
