Hi Don,

Sorry, I have not been able to call you today,
as it has been extremely busy.

I will be on vacation on Mon. and Tues.,
so I will call you on Wed. when I return.

I look forward to speaking with you about 
a job opportunity in on the Hourly Trading Desk.

Sincerely,
Joe Capasso

Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso
