Hi Don,

I know its been a while since my last email or phone call,
but I am still very interested in the position.  
Therefore, I am going to post for the position via Human Resources.
(Just so that I am going through the correct channels.)
I wanted to drop you a quick note before I send it to HR.

I am still interested in sitting on the desk for a couple of 
hours so that I can learn more.  Which day would be best
for a quick visit?

I hope all is well and I hope to speak with you soon.

Sincerely,
Joe Capasso
