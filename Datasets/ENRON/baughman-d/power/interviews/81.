Don,
Please advise of your interest in the following Candidates.

 

I am attaching the resume for Tom Tahl. Tom is currently a Foreign Exchange Options Trader, for Deutsche Bank in N.Y.

 
 Jeff Gerl is an Internal Employee who is interested in the 24-hour Desk position.

 
Steven Coulter is an Agency submittal, I talked to Steven and he is very interested in opportunities. The dot com company he was working for closed it's doors on Friday, so he is "actively" looking. 

  
Regards,
Courtnie Parker
