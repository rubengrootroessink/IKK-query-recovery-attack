Don:
I handed you little brothers res over to Molly Harris.  Molly is a Dir in the Credit Risk Management department of RAC (currently my boss) and is looking to bring on at least 2 new people.  Molly reports to Bill Bradford and I know Bill is looking for other people in lue of the 2 Molly needs.  I will give Bill a copy of Travis's res as well.  Also, you can reference Job #'s 108954, 108911 and 104663 on Enrons job board for descriptions of Credit Risk Management openings.  
I hope this helps,
Andrew
