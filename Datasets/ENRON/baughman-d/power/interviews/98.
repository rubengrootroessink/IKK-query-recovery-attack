Mr. Baughman

I am highly interested in this position.  I have limited knowledge of the power industry through exposure to underwriting, notional pricing, commodity structuring, and my risk mgmt groups.

My best qualifying strength:  highly aggressive, professional personality.   


 

Please call to discuss.  

Regards

Dennis Brown
