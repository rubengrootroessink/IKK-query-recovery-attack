Don,
  Hope you had a great weekend.  Last time we had spoke,  I inquired about sitting with someone on your desk after work.    I hope the invitation is still open.  I would like to come up sometime this week, if possible.  As I mentioned before, I am really interested in power and working nights.  If you have any objections, please let me know. 

Thank you !

Zarin Imam
