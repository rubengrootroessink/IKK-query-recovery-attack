I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio
