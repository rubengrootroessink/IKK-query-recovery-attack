   Don,

   As promised I talked to someone here who is knowledgable about pagers.
   The
   pager service GMP subscribes to has nationwide service, and GMP only
   subscribes to service for the Northeast because that's all we require.
   I'm
   betting that Enron's paging provider has nationwide service, so the page
   sent by Vermont Yankee will reach Houston as long as Enron subscribes to
   nationwide service.  The tech here at GMP said that a lot of paging is
   Internet based now.  For instance a page sent by Vermont Yankee would be
   translated into an email and arrive in Houston as an email and then a
   machine in Houston would transmit the email to a tower in Houston which
   would send the page.  I was told by someone at Vermont Yankee they use
   "Air
   Source Pro" software to send the page and Enron's paging provider must
   have
   software compatible with Air Source Pro in order for Enron to receive
   the
   page.

   Could you check with a tech person at Enron to find out whether your
   paging
   provider is compatible with Air Source Pro and whether Enron subscribes
   to
   nationwide service?

      Woody,

      Sorry for the delay in my response.  I was out on Tuesday &
   Wednesday.
      I am

      forwarding an email from Nancy Brock (below).  Does Enron wish to be
      paged

      (if that's technically feasible), or would email satisfy Enron?

      I spoke with VY yesterday about notifying Enron.  We should work with
      Bobbi

      (Bruce is far less willing to accommodate...).  Bobbi says she will
   be
      happy

      to add Enron to the pager list as long as Enron has a VY pager that
      works in

      Houston.  In the alternative, she will add Enron to the blast email.
      Since I

      assume that Enron's email would be monitored 24/7 for this sort of
      thing,

      that may be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  She said that emails
      are

      not sent for every downpower (whereas pagers are notified for almost

      everything), depending on severity.  I would say that next step is to

      understand what can be done with an email and does it satisfy the
   Enron

      needs.  If that doesn't work, we'll have to see about the pager.  I
      think

      Bobbi wants to accommodate us, she just needs to understand what
   Enron

      needs.
