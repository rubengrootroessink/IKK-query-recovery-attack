Hi Don,

How are things going at Enron?  I am just checking on the the status of your
submitting your into Cinergy hourly trades.
We have a few sources submitting already, and we hope to announce the index
soon.
I hope all is going well with you. Please let me know if there is anything
that I can do to move this along.

Thank you,
