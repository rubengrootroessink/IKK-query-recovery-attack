It's still a bit of a mystery. Our tech guy suggests that Doug try to send a
test email to tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com to see if an error message
comes back to him. I know he is probably not there now, but I hope things
work tonight when he sends.

Well, if the e-mail address "tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com" is correct,
then no.

have the guy try sending an e-mail to that address now.

Does he get anything back, like an error message?

Can ya'll tell anything from the below? He thinks we are not getting our

I think y'all might want to check your e-mail server.  It looks to me that
my night guys have been e-mailing our contribution to your index.

Give me a call or e-mail me with any questions.
