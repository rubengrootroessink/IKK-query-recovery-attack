Two of TradersNews Energy's?three new hourly  indexes,?the TVA and ComEd 
hubs, are attached. We will distribute these two indexes to you at no charge 
via e-mail  during the beta testing period, which?concludes March 19. On 
that  date,?we will formally launch the indexes on our Web site, at:? 
www.tradersnewsenergy.com.

of testing,?e-mail Suzanna Strangmeier, at suzanna.strangmeier@ipgdirect.com, 
 or call her at 713/647-7325.

Your participation is vital to produce  the most comprehensive and accurate 
indexes. You may e-mail your prices and  volumes (or a bid/ask spread for 
each peak hour) to tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com,  or fax them to 
713-647-7552.

These three new indexes join TradersNews' Cinergy, AEP and SPP/Entergy
