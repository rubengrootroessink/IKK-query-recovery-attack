Rika:

I enjoyed speaking with you today.

Attached is an example of our Cinergy hourly index and a chart listing the
start dates of all six hourly indexes.

Also attached is our current methodology (dated 3/01) and a draft
methodology incorporating changes we expect to institute shortly. The most
significant of these changes will make the Cinergy index more of a mirror of
the Into Cinergy next-day product. We have received some feedback from Enron
already on these changes but welcome additional comments.

I have asked Barbara Clancey of our customer service department to register
you, Don Baughman, Matt Lorenz and Juan Hernandez for access to our website
www.tradersnewsenergy.com She will send you an e-mail with your password and
logon information.

By separate e-mail, I will be sending you spreadsheets containing the
historical data. I will need our CTO, Greg Baber, to talk to you or your
technical contact to set up an FTP procedure to automate your receipt of the
indexes going forward.

Finally, Gene Simpson and I are set to meet you and the Enron team in your
office at 2 p.m. Monday Oct. 8. I will contact you next week to discuss the
agenda for our meeting and ensure that you have all the information you
need.

Feel free to contact me in the meantime with any questions.

Regards,
