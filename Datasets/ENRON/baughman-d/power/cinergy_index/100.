Don,

I am glad that we had a chance to talk this morning. I am pleased that I
have your support for our Into Cinergy hourly index.

I am attaching the draft of our methodology and our confidentiality
agreement. Pleased forward your comments and/or suggestions.

I look forward to working with you and meeting you.

Thank you,
