Attached are the first for TVA and ComEd (ERCOT is  sent on a separate list). 
?

We will distribute these two indexes to you at no  charge via e-mail during 
the beta testing period, which?concludes March 19.  On that date,?we will 
formally launch the indexes on our Web site,  at:? www.tradersnewsenergy.com. 
 

Your participation is vital to produce the most comprehensive and  accurate 
indexes. You may e-mail your prices and volumes to 
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com,  or fax them to 713-647-7552. For your 
convenience, attached is an Excel file  you
can use to report your prices and volumes.

These three new indexes  join TradersNews' Cinergy, AEP and SPP/Entergy 
hourly indexes, launched in Fall  2000.  
NOTE: If you are using our Excel Upload feature,  hourly indexes for Feb. 16 
will be featured until 3:30?p.m. CST, today  only, because of yesterday's 
federal holiday. After 3:30 p.m. today, we will  feature those for Feb. 19.

of testing,?e-mail Suzanna Strangmeier, at suzanna.strangmeier@ipgdirect.com,
