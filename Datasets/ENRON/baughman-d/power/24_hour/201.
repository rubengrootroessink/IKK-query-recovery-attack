The Network Dept is planning to swap out some network switches this weekend and want to make sure that this would not inconvenience the customers on EB31. Approximately 30 users could be affected. They would like to do the work Saturday morning, starting at 9 am. It should all be done by Noon. Please let me know by 3PM if this will affected any of your people. I am especially concerned about the 24 Hour East Power Traders.

Thanks,
