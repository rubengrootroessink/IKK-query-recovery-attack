The new P&L is in the following directory under NT Explorer:  
M:/Electric/24hour/application/PandLNew.exe.  There have been many great 
ideas and suggestions on how to handle the new reorg.  There is one thing to 
remember in all of this, we are still a team and even though you have your 
own p&l for whatever region that you are responsible for we are all still 
responsible for Enron.  Below is a list or guidelines on how to handle the 
different situations.

The hourly books are Northeast Hourly, Midwest Hourly, Southeast Hourly, and 
Ercot Hourly.  There is no more Short Term Hourly or Short Term Hourly 
Management.

1. Any incremental deals that are done will go into the P&L and EnPower under 
the SINKS region and at the end of the shift there will be an annuity done 
between the appropiate regions.  For example:   AEP-TVA-SOCO  Everything will 
go in the Southeast Hourly book.  Then Southeast Hourly will do an annuity to 
give Midwest Hourly their share.  Everything will be split down the middle.

2. Any positions that we inherit will go into the region where the position 
is and then there will be a Book Transfer done to balance everyone.  For 
example:  ENWC is long 100 mw's.  The transmission and sell will go in the 
Midwest Hourly P&L and Book in EnPower and then a Book Transfer will be done 
between Midwest Hourly and whatever book that the position is in.  

3. We had a situation today where Hourly Northeast wanted to buy the ENWC 
position to take to PJM and his bid was better than the market.  The correct 
way to handle this would be that Hourly Midwest  to sell Horly Northeast the 
power at ENWC. Hourly Northeast   would put a buy from Midwest Hourly, the 
transmission, and the PJM sell in the Northeast Hourly book  and P&L.  
Midwest Hourly would put a sell to Northeast Hourly in their P&L and book and 
then would do a Book Transfer with the responsible book of the ENWC position.

It is very important that we learn EnPower like the back of our hands.  Tresa 
Allen's group will no longer baby sit us, it is now our responsiblity.  It is 
crucial that you understand what book that positions are in,  Some positions 
could be in multiple books. Corry has told me that the scheduler's will try 
to put what books are responsible for what positions on their lotus notes 
that they put out.  You can also look the deals up in EnPower.  EnPower is a 
process that shows how acurate you are and whether or not you can pay 
attention to detail.  

If you have any questions please let me know I am available 24/7.

Thanks
