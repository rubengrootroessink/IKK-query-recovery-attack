Don, just wanted to let you know that the change on the switches has been postponed and no one will be affected this weekend.

Thanks,
Joe

Thank you very much for doing this. They have postponed this Change Control until they are certain that it will not affect the traders.

Pablo

Can either of you get me a list of port ID's and locations for 24 Hour East Power Traders? Gail in Network Dept may be swapping out switches on EB31 this weekend. We don't want for any of these traders to be affected. Please, speak to Don Baughman so he can point out the traders that need to be excluded.

Thanks,
