Kim attached is the general job function and plan for the staff requested below.  This plan has been reviewed with the majority of the staff on the email above.

The end result will vary but generally this plan will allow the floor to create a pool of staff that will ensure the trading floor is well supported on the trading, scheduling, hourly and services areas from the core of our fundamentals group.  By using the spring and fall - of cycle staff we will also be able to better manage the core summer analyst rotations.

I'm looking forward to the orientation and training of this new talent and Thanks for you assistance in this matter.

Please ensure that the eight staff that we require in August come from the list the Kevin Presto has issued you.
