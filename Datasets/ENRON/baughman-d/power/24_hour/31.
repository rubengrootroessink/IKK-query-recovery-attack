		DJ MAIN/Summer -2: 5,473 MW Of Power Added In Last Year 
		
		Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  
		
		
		
		CHICAGO  (Dow Jones)--The Mid-American Interconnected Network Inc., a  
grid-monitoring group for the central Midwest region, said Wednesday  that 
increased power supplies will improve utilities' ability to  meet expected 
demand levels in the region this summer.  
		
		?????In its annual summer assessment,  MAIN said that 5,473 megawatts of new 
power has been added in the  region in the last year, or will be online 
before the summer begins.  About 1,255 megawatts of this new power is 
committed to serving  demand in the MAIN area, which includes Illinois, 
Wisconsin and  parts of Michigan and Missouri.  
		
		?????"MAIN members have improved their  ability to serve customers by adding 
new generation, making power  purchases and upgrading the electric 
transmission system," said  Richard Bulley, MAIN's executive director, in a 
release. "We do not  anticipate any major limitations on the region's bulk 
transmission  system and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than 
18%."  
		
		?????The summer report was approved by  MAIN's board of directors Tuesday, 
MAIN spokeswoman Jackie Olson  said.

		??????DJ MAIN/Summer -3: Peak  Pwr Load Seen Up Almost 6%  
		
		?????  
		
		?????  
		
		?????MAIN estimates that its peak load  will reach 55,221 megawatts this 
year, a 5.8% boost from last year's  actual peak load. If power cuts to 
customers with interruptible  service contracts were enacted to conserve 
supplies, or if other  load management practices were used, MAIN estimated 
that the region  can reduce summer load by 3,404 megawatts if needed.  
		
		?????While peak loads seem to be growing  at an extreme pace, demand levels 
were actually much  lighter-than-expected last year, MAIN's Olson noted.  
		
		?????"Last year was just an unusually  cool summer," she said.  
		
		?????In 1999, by comparison, MAIN's  actual peak demand load spiked to a 
record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, Olson said. By comparing 
this year's expected  peak load with 1999's actual peak load, MAIN's demand 
levels are  actually increasing at a steady 1.3% rate.  
		
		?????The figures have been adjusted to  reflect Madison, Wis.-based Alliant 
Energy Corp.'s (LNT) move into  MAIN last summer. Supply and load from 
western parts of the  utility's system are now operated in MAIN instead of 
the neighboring  Mid-Continent Area Power Pool region.  
		
		?????MAIN's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be 
available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost, 
including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts. That amount is up sharply 
from last  spring's forecasts for 56,523 megawatts of summer 2000 supplies.  
		
		?????The strong power supply boost  should give the region an available 
reserve margin of 18.4% this  summer, compared with forecasts for a 16.7% 
reserve margin a year  ago. Most U.S. grid regions target at least a 15% 
summer margin to  guard against heat-driven demand spikes and unplanned power 
plant  outages.

		??????DJ MAIN/Summer -4:  Transmission Tight But Manageable  
		
		?????  
		
		?????  
		
		?????According to MAIN's summer report,  "MAIN's import capabilities from its 
surrounding regions are  considered adequate."  
		
		?????A major Illinois transmission  system added by Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) 
Commonwealth Edison Co. last  summer as well as transmission upgrades from 
other utilities have  improved transmission reliability in certain key areas 
of the  region, MAIN said.  
		
		?????The grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are 
lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly 
tighter than last  year. But this estimate has been re-calibrated to account 
for  Alliant's move into MAIN, and overall transmission capacity seems to  
have improved, MAIN's Olson said.  
		
		?????MAIN also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the 
north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission 
loading relief," or TLR's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened 
lines.  
		
		?????"System reinforcements and changes  in operating measures will enhance 
the effectiveness of TLR actions  this summer," MAIN said in the report. "But 
large power transfers  will require close monitoring by all system 
operators."
