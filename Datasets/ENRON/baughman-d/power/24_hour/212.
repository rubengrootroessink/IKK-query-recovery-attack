Dear Sir,

I submitted a hourly off peak transmission request no. 241865 at
2001-10-09 12:55:39 in error. I immediately submitted the correct
request no. 241866, used on tag no. PM1010C.  I also contacted SPP
regarding the matter, in effect requesting assignment no. 241865 to be
annulled.
Therefore, EPMI respectfully requests that Oasis reservation no. 241865
be annulled.
Thank you in advance for your assistance regarding this matter.
Don C. Baughman Jr.
