As promised at last week's meeting, here a follow-up to the current and
proposed PJM and PJM West ATC OASIS postings.
Currently the ATC evaluation is being performed at PJM with consultation of
Allegheney Power.  The determination being performed is for PJM and PJM WEST
paths as they would exist after December 31, 2001.  The coordinated ATC
values, for service beyond December 31, 2001 are being divided between PJM
and AP, with each portion being posted on the respective OASIS.  The paths
between PJM and AP, and between AP and PJM, are being posted as zero.
It is intended that all PJM and PJM WEST transmission service beginning
January 1, 2002 and beyond be posted and requested on the PJM OASIS as soon
as possible.  The most probable date for the transition to full posting on
the PJM OASIS site would be Monday October 1, 2001 coincident with the PJM
Monthly Transmission Service postings.  It would be hard, at this time, to
imagine overcoming the remaining necessary infrastructure changes in time to
meet the PJM Monthly posting date of September 3, 2001.
Once the transition to a single OASIS takes place the January 1, 2002 and
beyond postings will be zero on the AP OASIS.  All AP OASIS existing
transmission service for January 1, 2002 and beyond will be converted to the
PJM OASIS maintaining the original service request date and time.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call or e-mail.
