( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Alstom Power Awarded Contract for East
Kentucky Power Co-op SCR Unit Addition, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 9, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC)
(Winchester, Ky) awarded Alstom Power Incorporated (Windsor,
Connecticut) the engineering and construction contract for a Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit addition at its Eastern Kentucky power
plant. Construction of the new SCR unit supporting the 300 mega-watt
(MW) Spurlock No. 2 Power unit, will begin during their scheduled
8-week outage starting September 2001. This new SCR unit will reduce
NOx emissions mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean
Air Act standards.
	   The addition of SCR's and other emissions reduction equipment will
become an expenditure that many power producers will have to deal with
as the deadline for meeting emission reduction standards grows closer.
	   Established in 1941, EKPC is a transmission and generation utility
that provides wholesale energy and distribution services to 17
cooperatives from its power plants and more than 2,500 miles of
transmission lines.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Power and Energy markets as well as other industrial
sectors send inquires to powergroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at
