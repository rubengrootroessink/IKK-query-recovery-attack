Don:
How possible would it be to let me have the weekend of August 17th off?  According to the current August schedule I am working that weekend, would it be easier for me to try to arrange a swap with a co worker?
Thanks,
Andrew

Compadres,

Please include PJM EAST HUB on the Shift Note, include On-peak, Off-peak and All-day averages.

The NE boys tell me that the same values are available on the PJM Summary page.

If you have any questions, drop me line or call.

Thank you,

Don
