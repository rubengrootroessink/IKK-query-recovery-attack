Don,

The EES Business Center is the primary point of contact for potential customers to contact EES regarding our products and services.  If a commercial/ industrial customer mistakenly calls the Enron Power Marketing 1-800# and sounds more like an EES customer, please forward the call to our customer service representatives.

Internally, call transfers can be made to ext. 59390, or the customer can be asked to call 1-800-337-7827.

Thank you,

Chris Atherton
EES Business Center
