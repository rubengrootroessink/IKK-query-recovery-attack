Subject: Entergy Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.


Please see below re Entergy's adoption of flexible firm redirect rights!


Date: August 21, 2001

To: Entergy Transmission Customers

Subject:  Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.


Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting
partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines
listed
below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and
successfully
allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become available
for
other customers to purchase. If you have any questions, please call David
McNeill at 870-541-3931 or Cameron Warren at 870-543-5497.



Section 22.2 - Modification on a Firm Basis

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the
source/sink or
POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no
additional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for
firm
service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via
OASIS
using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to the
start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm
basis
(twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current
business
practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original
request in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity
as
the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the
original reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly,
monthly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of
original reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start
date
or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights
to
the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release
the
original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes to
revert
back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subject to the
same
guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original
reservation
only.
