Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract, about a month ago.

How is your gig?

Best wishes,

Hi Don,

How's everything going for you, haven't talk to you in a long time.

Are the financial difficulties at Enron effecting you much?
