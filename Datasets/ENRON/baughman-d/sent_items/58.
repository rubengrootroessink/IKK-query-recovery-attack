> A newlywed couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband,
> although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party
> with his old buddies. So, he said to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right
> back..."
> "Where are you going, coochy cooh...?" asked the wife.
> "I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I'm going to have a beer."
> The wife said, "You want a beer, my love?" She opened the door to the
> refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12
> different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.
> The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think
> of saying was, "Yes, loolie loolie...but at the bar.... you know...they
> have frozen glasses..."
> He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by
> saying, "You want a frozen glass, puppy face?" She took a huge beer mug
> out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.
>
> The husband, looking a bit pale, said, "Yes, tootsie roll, but at the bar
> they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be
> long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"
> "You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?" She opened the oven and took out
> 15 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket,
> mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.
> "But sweet honey...at the bar...you know...there's swearing, dirty words
> and all that..."
> "You want dirty words, cutie pie?"...
> ..."LISTEN, DICKHEAD! DRINK YOUR FUCKING BEER IN YOUR GOD-DAMN FROZEN MUG
> AND EAT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE!
> .....GOT IT, ASSHOLE?!!"
