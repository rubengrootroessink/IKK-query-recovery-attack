Don,

It was a pleasure talking with you yesterday evening. Thank you for making
the time to meet with us. I am looking forward to working with you on this
index. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.
I am attaching the spreadsheet for you to enter your trades. Again, if you
need something different, just let me know.
