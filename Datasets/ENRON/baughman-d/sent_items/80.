Frank was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He
spotted a small brown bear and shot
it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a
big black bear. The black bear
said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have
rough sex."
Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,
Frank soon recovered and
vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black
bear and shot it.
There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear
stood right next to him.
The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two
choices. Either I maul
you to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again, Frank thought it was
better to
comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before
Frankfinally recovered.
Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly
and shot it.
He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He
turned around to find a giant polar bear
standing there. The polar bear said: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come
here for the hunting, do you?"
