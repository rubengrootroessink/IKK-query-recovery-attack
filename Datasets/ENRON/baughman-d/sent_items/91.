Subject:=09FW: Move Related Issues



As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend. =20

?=09Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all n=
ew voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greet=
ings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover=
 the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed whe=
n you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon you=
r arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on. =20

?=09Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Mo=
nday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it=
 is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in o=
n Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who=
 are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names ha=
ve been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday=
.
o=09Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?=09Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the r=
outes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure =
to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you nee=
d additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highligh=
ted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have=
 their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access withou=
t their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via =
the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back throug=
h the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kio=
sk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to=
 ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?=09Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a=
 list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be =
on the floor when we move in. =20
o=09Red - Move Team
o=09Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o=09Green - Telephony

?=09Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subsc=
riptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all =
daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor co=
rridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up =
the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up t=
he papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of EC=
N, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?=09Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more tha=
n about 4  boxes per person. =20

?=09Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any label=
s, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels pr=
inted.

?=09Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been remo=
ved from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are=
 left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to =
move the computers as scheduled.

.=09Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses fi=
ltered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on=
 the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of=
 water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water =
at several locations. =20

?=09Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to =
remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret=
 or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be wa=
iting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might=
 have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much =
for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRID=
AY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with=
 the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd
