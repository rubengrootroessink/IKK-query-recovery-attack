I'm ready for the fishing!  I was able to ride on Joe's boat after he got it, very nice.  It should run very skinny.

I hope all is well.

Later,
DB

Thanks for the invite.  I wish I could make it.  You need to plan a trip
down here for a little fin and feather.  Joe got himself a nice custom
flats and we need to break it in right.  A lot of geese and ducks are
being killed on lake Mathis right now and I'm sure we can manage to find
some trout somewhere.

Happy birthday and drink one for me.
