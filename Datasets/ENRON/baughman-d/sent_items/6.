Hola senorita,

What's goin on with you? Just trying to get this business cranked up!  Yeah I've been busier that an one legged man in an ass kickin' contest!  The weekend was great, I'm pretty sure that I'll join the Krewe of Gambrinus, after Mardi Gras.  What have you been up to?  How was your weekend?  What's goin' on this week.  Find a night when I can cook you supper and have some beer & cider. I've got my sister's birthday party at Mom & Dad's tonight, but open the rest of the week.  Drop me a line when you have a chance.

Take care,

DB
