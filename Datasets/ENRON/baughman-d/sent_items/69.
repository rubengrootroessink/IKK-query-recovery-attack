COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday
 for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.

One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to
look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery
substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by
Coach R.C.
Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.

After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign
white substance that they found was the goal line.
