Lisa,

As per our conversation on Monday, don.baughman@enron.com will be valid for another week or so.  As soon as I find out what the new email address will be, I'll send you an email.

Thanks for sending the daily MWD Hourly Index and historicals (if possible) for Dec.2001 and Jan.2002.

I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial relationship between UBS Warburg Energy and Platts.
