Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen bounding
around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
Thursday.
A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was not
clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday afternoon,''
said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also covers
suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons ``are
deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne, the
family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He will
be truly missed.''
Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White House
as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House in
January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton
