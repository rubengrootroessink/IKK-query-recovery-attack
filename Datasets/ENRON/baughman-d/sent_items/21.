I thought that you were going Skiing?  The guys we went hunting w/ didn't know what they were doing!  We drank a lot of beer & whisky, played paintball, ate BBQ & sat around the campfire.

Got an open night to grab drinks this week if you are not going skiing?

Late,

Just wondering if you are at work today or not??? If so - we're going  
to Happy Hour again - but wasn't sure what time y'all were leaving for  
deep East Texas hunting extravaganza?! So, thought I'd see ...
