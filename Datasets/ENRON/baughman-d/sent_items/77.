Hi Don.

Were you going to send the trades?
I thought that maybe you meant to attach them, but left them off.

      Can you please send your hourly trades for November 5 (yesterday).
      There was a problem with our/my e-mail system and I did not get your
      trades.
      It seems to be working now.

      Thanks,
