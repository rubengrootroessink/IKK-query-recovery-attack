>  Watch out for  this...
>  Chances are if you're not a victim, you know someone  who is!  Police
>  warn all male clubbers, party-goers and  unsuspecting pub regulars to
>be more alert and cautious when accepting a drink offer from a girl.
>
>  There is a date rape drug going around called  "beer", and sometimes
>  "bourbon", it appears in liquid form.  The drug is being used by
>female sexual predators at parties  to convince male victims to have
sex
>with them.
>  "Beer" is available virtually anywhere.
>
>  All  girls have to do is persuade a guy to consume a few units of
>"beer" and simply ask him home for no-strings-attached sex. Men are
>rendered helpless against such attacks. After several "beers"  men will
>often succumb to performing sex acts on  horrific looking women who
they
>would never normally be  attracted to.
>
>  Men often wake up after having  "beer" with only hazy memories of
>what happened to them the  night before, just a vague feeling that
>something bad  occurred. At other times these unfortunate men might be
>conned into familiar scam known as "a relationship" - apparently men
are
>easier victims for this scam after the "beer" has been  administered
and
>they have already been sexually  attacked.
>
>  Forward this to every male you  know..........
>  However, if you fall victim to this insidious  drug and the predatory
>  women administering it, there are male  support groups where you can
>  discuss the details  of your shocking encounter in an open manner
with a
>bunch of similarly-affected guys. For your nearest support group just
look
>up 'Pubs' in the yellow pages.
