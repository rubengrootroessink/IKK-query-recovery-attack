        I just wanted to pass on information regarding the use of the NERC generator shift factor (GSF) viewer.  This can be accessed via the NERC TLR public web site ( <http://crc.nerc.com>), as indicated in the TLR document.  Next, click on the GSF viewer button.  A special username / password is not required to access this information.  We are using Netscape version 4.75 in the Security Center.  The GSF viewer seems to work fine via Netscape.  When accessing the viewer: 

1) "Matrix" box:  Select current day.  The program will run to collect the current generator shift factor information. 
2) "Report" box: As indicated in the document, there are a number of different ways to display (or retrieve) this information. 
2A) Using the "report box", if you select the "top100 pairs", the program will provide inter-control area generator shift factor information based upon the best 10 increasing units, against the best 10 decreasing units. 
2B) Using the "report box", if you select the "all transactions", the program will provide generator shift factor information based upon the "set 1" and "set 2" control areas you select.  If you want intra-control area generator shift factor information, select the same control area for both "set 1" and "set 2". 
3) Check out the other options as well.
