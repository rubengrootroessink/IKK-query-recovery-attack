Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

Carrie
