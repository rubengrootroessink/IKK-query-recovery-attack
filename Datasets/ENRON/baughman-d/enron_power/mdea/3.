Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie
