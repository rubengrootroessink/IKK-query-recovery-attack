*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

The focus of this meeting is to identify key issues we face in being able to physically delivery power to retail load in the areas listed below--what does EPMI need to do to facilitate this?  Have we completed the necessary steps with the Utilities?  Licenses?  What needs to be done to get a transmission agreement in place for designation of a TSA?

These existing load figures are based on all customers, actual economics based on utility standard offers will dictate what percentage is economically viable to take physical.  The initial need for CG&E will be getting the transmission agreements in place to be able to designate a TSA (transmission scheduling agent).  

Utility	State	Wholesale Market	Physical Start Date	New Load	Existing Load
