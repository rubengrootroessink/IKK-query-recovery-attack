I was looking at the imbalance on November 1 and it shows that we are long as many as 8 mgw's.  I know how it is and do not want to armchair quarterback but we need explanations of why this happens and I don't see any in the services comment section.  It is imperative that we keep notes and try our best not to be more than 2 mgw's off either way.  that is 2 minus the bandwith allotment. 

Thanks
Kayne
