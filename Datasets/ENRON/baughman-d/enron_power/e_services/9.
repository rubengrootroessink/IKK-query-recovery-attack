Jeff attached is the Cleveland spread sheet that has their long term contracts and the associated surplus.  Please total up all of the surplus energy by month so we can see how much value we can bring to them by selling this surplus hourly for them and run it through your new calculator. Please work with Don Baughman on both of this deal and Owensboro to get a feel for the market price and scalars for these areas.

Please keep JT Kinser informed as the account manager for now.  We also will need a draft term sheet for them by this Friday.  Please start a term sheet for this deal.

I have created a new directory and placed this spread sheet in it.  When done the term sheet please ensure a copy is placed there.
