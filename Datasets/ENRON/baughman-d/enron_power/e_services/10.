ADM Power Portfolio Evaluation

Market Conditions:

Ratings (#1 Best)
1.  Decatur, IL (IP Control Area  = CA)
2.  Southport, NC (CP&L CA)
3.  Clinton, IA and Cedar Rapids, IA (Alliant CA)
4.  Peoria, IL (CILCO CA)
5.  Des Moines, IA (MEC CA)

The most desirable ADM facility is the Decatur, IL plant, in regards to market conditions, some of which are:
1.  Dynegy/IP are trading an IP-TVA,AMRN,CEAEP,MEC hourly physical product online @ DynegyDirect.com
2.  IP CA has 8 Direct connects to other utilities(UT), 5 of which are very desirable e.g.. TVA, AEP, AMRN, MEC, CE.
3.  Several smaller UTs in the general area, this is a benefit due to their propensity to be short/long small and non-standard quantities.

The facilities in CP&L is rated 2 due to excess mw levels and location.  SERC is a prime market area due to it is net short during peak periods under gas generation.  The next most desirable facilities are the Clinton & Cedar Rapids which are both connected to the ALT CA.  The major advantage is the accessibility to the MAPP area due to its abundance of cheap base load power.  ALT is on the border of both the MAPP area (good cheap supply) and MAIN (good supply & demand.)  The peoria plant is farther down on the scale due to CILCO few interconnects AMRN, IP, CWL&P and CE, these are good major interconnects , however, the CILCO CA is very small.  The lowest ranked facility in ADM's portfolio is the Des Moines plant is located in the MEC CA. The MEC CA is located on the border of MAIN & MAPP which has benefits, but , the major hurdle is the small load and generation levels.  Small amounts are very difficult to supply and market.

Transmission by CA:

Ratings:
1.  CP&L  = Ample amounts of transmission, limited congestion problems.
2.  IP = Good levels of available trans. some congestion problems.
3.  ALT = Acceptable levels of ATC, some congestion problems.
4.  CILCO = Ample ATC for small CA size.  Fewer interconnects than others.
5.  MEC = Limited ATC and congestions difficulties.


Please contact me with any questions or additional information.

Don,

As we discussed, can you please provide some comments on each of the ADM locations listed on the attachment below.  Some thoughts on the difficulty of moving power in each area (ie transmission availability) as well as the general market conditions and opportunities in each would be helpful.  Also, any comments on how difficult the utility involved is to deal with would be good.  The intention is to pick one or more sites for a trial management deal with ADM.

Thanks,

Tom.

Bret:

Thanks again for taking time to meet with Tom May, Terri Clynes and me
regarding Enron's power services products on June 27.

I would like to firm a date for our follow up meeting. We had discussed
your coming to Houston to meet at our office on Tuesday
July 24. Does that date work for you ? I would propose flying down the
night before. We could meet in the morning then play golf in
the afternoon followed by dinner at Cafe Annie (one of Houston's best).
Alternatively, you could fly down Tuesday morning for an
afternoon meeting followed by dinner, cigars, etc. Let me know what
works best.

In addition, we had discussed 6 facilities to look at for potential
services trials. They were Southport, Peoria, Clinton, Cedar Rapids,
Decatur and Des Moines. Can you provide the following information by
facility:

1. plant demand
2. generation capability
3. utility tariff facility is under
4. does facility have an interconnect agreement
5.    "       "        "    real-time metering
6. what is the voltage level of the interconnection

If you could provide this information in advance of the July 24 meeting,
we can perform some critical initial due diligence. Let me know
if the July 24 date works for you.


Regards,   Ed
