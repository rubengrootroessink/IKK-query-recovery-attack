Don,

Attached is a detailed list of procedures and ideas on MHEB to send to the hourly crew.  With the end of August, lots of power, especially on-peak, is now available that was previously under contract for the summer.  We should have more opportunities to move this power.  They can call me with any questions.  Thanks.
