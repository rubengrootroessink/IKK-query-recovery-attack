Please mark your calendars for a East Power Trading Pre PRC Meeting to be held June 18th 2001 at 2pm-4pm in Room EB49C3. 


     Prior to the meeting, you will receive a spreadsheet that will contain the names of the individuals that you are listed to represent as of the cut off date of 4/30/01.  I will need you to review  the names to ensure that we have captured the information accurately.   Bear in mind that I am aware that changes have been made in regards to your direct reports since then.  Individuals that have been with the company less than 6 months will not be rated, however, they will go through the feedback and performance review process. 

Items to bring to the meeting include:

1.   Copies of the supervisor feedback reports from the PEP system  (if you have difficulty retrieving this information, please contact me), 
2.   A list of each employee's accomplishments  (also listed in PEP under the employee self review section)
3.   A pre-rank for each employee under your supervision. 


Note: it is important that you review the employees accomplishments in the PEP system prior to attending a PRC meeting as this information will show up on the screen during the meeting.  If an employee has not entered this information into the PEP system, please meet with them in advance to obtain this information in order for you to be prepared.  Feel free to contact me should you have additional questions.
