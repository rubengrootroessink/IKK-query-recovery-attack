Paul,

I enjoyed talking with you today about opportuniites within Enron. I am not
disappointed with Shell Energy, but I really want to get back into wholesale
trading of Power.

Attached is a copy of my current resume. My resume does not reflect the
short contract consulting position that I held with Nucleus/Caminus.

I look forward to further discussions concerning employment opportunities.

I can be reached by phone at :

281-277-6486 - Home
713-241-4387 - Work

Thank-you for your time,

Jeffrey A. Bassett
