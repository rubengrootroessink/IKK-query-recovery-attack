Don, 

Joe is a guy you definitely want to consider.  In fact, we wanted to bring him into our group, but we are in a hiring freeze and with the changes occurring in our group we don't know when we would be able to bring him in.  Anyway, just wanted to give you some feedback.  Hope you didn't get drowned out this weekend!!

Take care,

John

John,

As we talked about minutes ago, I am sending you my resume.
In addition, I just sent my resume to Don with some short comments 
about my work experience.

Thanks for directing me to him.  I really appreciate your help.

Thanks,
Joe
