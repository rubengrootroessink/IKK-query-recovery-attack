Andy, attached is a MISO market trials checksheet.  Don't know whether you are on the distribution list but you should make sure that you get on it.  Can you have a look and get back to Mike if there are other issues that we need to check off before we are satisfied with the trials.  Also, MISO are having a set of educational sessions over the next couple of days, are you in on this?  I know that Lloyd has some people going so check in with him for coordination...

regards
Mike

Guy, didn't know if you were interested in MISO as well, let me know.
