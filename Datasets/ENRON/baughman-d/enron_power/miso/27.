Per our discussion this morning I've put the above date and time on my cale=
ndar to discuss the following groups as it relates to your business goals a=
nd needs.

State of Tennessee, has given an OK to Enron for upgrading FASER to E2is st=
atewide.  I wrote the product description for them for FASER which allowed =
the to do a software upgrade and not have to do a statewide RFP.  During th=
e meetings with them they indicated they are being courted by TVA to have a=
 statewide electric agreement with the State receiving one bill and TVA re-=
billing all of the Muni's and UDC's for their distribution charges.  The st=
ate's energy consumption is $90M/year.  The Energy Manager for the State is=
 on the Governor's Commisssion which just completed a statewide energy poli=
cy.  It will be announced in the near future.  During our meeting with them=
 he indicated that the Govenor who is Republican indicated that Enron had c=
reated President Bush's Energy Policy.  Since this could turn into a much n=
eeded positive political win for Enron, I had Pam Rosen, my marketing manag=
er advise Mark Palmer and  Rick Shapiro about the process.  Pam, also has c=
ontacted Barbara Hueter, from Governmental Affairs for Tennessee regarding =
the progress of this as well. =20

Metal Treating Institute, MTI is an Association has had a relationship with=
 Enron for the past couple of years.  Due to the different marketing strate=
gies of EES over the past couple of years they haven't been handled very we=
ll for gas.   Their CEO who has known me over the years asked me to speak a=
t their National Conference on 7/28 on energy,etc a few months back.  The i=
ntent was to get some type of energy program going for their members and I =
was also going to focus on how important it was to have software at all the=
 companies to assist them in having control of their data.  During a call t=
oday from Lance Miller, MTI's CEO he wanted to confirm the speaking arrange=
ment, topic, etc.  He also advised me their incoming International Presiden=
t is the largest metal treating in Canada and he asked him to contact his p=
erson at Enron Canada to call myself, and you about seeing if they could re=
ceive the same type of service here in the states.  (Sorry, for doing this =
but, with the latest re-org at EEIS, I needed to give him a name other than=
 myself to keep the relationship going)   The one unique thing about this g=
roup is that they would be willing to as an association do a master swap ag=
reement with a supplier and have their members ratify the deal.  Since Lanc=
e is attorney it was much easier for me to have him sell the Board of Direc=
tors on this concept.  Enron still has an opportunity to be the supplier fo=
r them however quite honestly, with all of the lack of interest by us over =
this past year their patience is running out and other companies are really=
 focusing on them as well.
 =20
City of Phoenix is a current E2is customer of EEIS and is looking to buy th=
eir power from someone, they are being courted by APS and SRP.

State of Michigan, is a new E2is customer as of this month and when I spoke=
 at their Big 10 Energy Conference two months ago they indicated their elec=
tric agreement and gas agreement are coming due.  They're currently $5 mill=
ion over budget because the didn't hedge their gas contract.  They also hav=
e issues with their gas fired co-gen which causes huge spikes in power and =
gas usage.  Using interval data, having all of their meter information and =
billing centralized on one system will be a tremendous assist to them.  The=
 other Big 11 as they call themselves all have similar situations.  Michiga=
n, wants to be the spokes person on this product as it evolves and the othe=
r schools are waiting for their input.

As you indicated, the timetable listed above could change depending on sche=
dules.  I will plan on it being so unless you notify otherwise.  Also, coul=
d you let me know where we will be meeting.

Thanks,

Dave
