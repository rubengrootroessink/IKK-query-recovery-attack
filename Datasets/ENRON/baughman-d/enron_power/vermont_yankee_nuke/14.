Don,

As promised I talked to someone here who is knowledgable about pagers.  The
pager service GMP subscribes to has nationwide service, and GMP only
subscribes to service for the Northeast because that's all we require.  I'm
betting that Enron's paging provider has nationwide service, so the page
sent by Vermont Yankee will reach Houston as long as Enron subscribes to
nationwide service.  The tech here at GMP said that a lot of paging is
Internet based now.  For instance a page sent by Vermont Yankee would be
translated into an email and arrive in Houston as an email and then a
machine in Houston would transmit the email to a tower in Houston which
would send the page.  I was told by someone at Vermont Yankee they use "Air
Source Pro" software to send the page and Enron's paging provider must have
software compatible with Air Source Pro in order for Enron to receive the
page.

Could you check with a tech person at Enron to find out whether your paging
provider is compatible with Air Source Pro and whether Enron subscribes to
nationwide service?

   Woody,

   Sorry for the delay in my response.  I was out on Tuesday & Wednesday.
   I am

   forwarding an email from Nancy Brock (below).  Does Enron wish to be
   paged

   (if that's technically feasible), or would email satisfy Enron?

   I spoke with VY yesterday about notifying Enron.  We should work with
   Bobbi

   (Bruce is far less willing to accommodate...).  Bobbi says she will be
   happy

   to add Enron to the pager list as long as Enron has a VY pager that
   works in

   Houston.  In the alternative, she will add Enron to the blast email.
   Since I

   assume that Enron's email would be monitored 24/7 for this sort of
   thing,

   that may be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  She said that emails
   are

   not sent for every downpower (whereas pagers are notified for almost

   everything), depending on severity.  I would say that next step is to

   understand what can be done with an email and does it satisfy the Enron

   needs.  If that doesn't work, we'll have to see about the pager.  I
   think

   Bobbi wants to accommodate us, she just needs to understand what Enron

   needs.
