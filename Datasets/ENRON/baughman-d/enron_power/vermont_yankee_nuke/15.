Woody,

Sorry for the delay in my response.  I was out on Tuesday & Wednesday.  I am

forwarding an email from Nancy Brock (below).  Does Enron wish to be paged

(if that's technically feasible), or would email satisfy Enron?

I spoke with VY yesterday about notifying Enron.  We should work with Bobbi

(Bruce is far less willing to accommodate...).  Bobbi says she will be happy

to add Enron to the pager list as long as Enron has a VY pager that works in

Houston.  In the alternative, she will add Enron to the blast email. Since I

assume that Enron's email would be monitored 24/7 for this sort of thing,

that may be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  She said that emails are

not sent for every downpower (whereas pagers are notified for almost

everything), depending on severity.  I would say that next step is to

understand what can be done with an email and does it satisfy the Enron

needs.  If that doesn't work, we'll have to see about the pager.  I think

Bobbi wants to accommodate us, she just needs to understand what Enron

needs.
