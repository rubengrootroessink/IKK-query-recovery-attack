On Saturday 5-05-01, Dean, Dustin & myself were attempting to schedule a 100 mws from NSP to AMRN for HE 16, and we received very little help or courtesy from the MAPP security center.  This deal cost us $1200 profit (bought $40 from NSP and sold $52 to AMRN). Three MAPP Fs were submitted showing as the POD:  (NSP.AMRN, ALTW.AMRN, MEC.AMRN).    All the requests were returned as "refused."  Ample ATCs were showing on the MAPP web page from NSP to AMRN, ALTW to AMRN, MEC to AMRN.  Pat, the file with these ATC printouts are on your desk.  No explanation was given as to the reason for the refusal on the oasis.  Furthermore, no explanation was given upon calling the MAPP Security Center.  In fact, the gentleman at MAPP hung up on us when we called.  

This was not an example of MAPP's finest in customer service.  Dustin suggested adding this situation to your complaint file.  We wanted to make you aware of the situation.
