Don,
           I was on vacation early this week. So I couldn't get back to you. If you let me know of a convenient time, we can meet and I can explain what I require. 

Thanks,
Praveen.

Don,
               I am with Vince Kaminski's Research group and I support EES. I am developing a simulation model for simulating hourly power prices, which requires these scalers for different regions in the East. It would be great if you can provide me this data. I was referred to you by Corry Bentley.

Thanks very much,
Praveen Mellacheruvu.
