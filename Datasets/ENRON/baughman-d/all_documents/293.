		DJ Ameren Expects 676-MW Of New Ill. Power Online By Summer

		CHICAGO  (Dow Jones)--Ameren Corp.'s (AEE) nonregulated power affiliate  
expects to bring about 676 megawatts of new natural-gas-fired power  in 
Illinois online this summer, a company spokesman said Tuesday.  
		
		?????The company plans to bring a new  117-megawatt unit online in Patoka, 
Ill., by mid- to late April,  spokesman Ed McDowall said. Ameren will bring 
another 117-megawatt  unit online at the south-central Illinois site by early 
June, he  said.  
		
		?????Ameren is also re-powering its  Grand Tower facility, located in Jackson 
County in southern  Illinois. Two coal-fired units that produce a combined 
202-megawatts  at the site will be removed, and two new gas-fired units with 
total  capacity of 326 megawatts will be added.  
		
		?????"Those two units are scheduled to  be online by midsummer," McDowall 
said.  
		
		?????The Grand Tower plant will also use  a heat-recovery system to produce 
power through the old turbines,  boosting its overall capacity to 500 
megawatts. That gives the  facility a net gain of 298 megawatts.  
		
		?????Ameren also has plans to boost  capacity at its 176-megawatt 
Pinckneyville, Ill., plant located in  the southwestern part of the state. 
Four new gas-fired units  totaling 144 megawatts of power will be brought 
online this summer  to join the four units that were brought online last 
summer, giving  the plant total capacity of 320 megawatts.  
		
		?????All the new units will run during  peak demand times and will be assets 
of Ameren Energy Generating  Co., a nonregulated affiliate of Ameren. The 
plants will sell power  to the region's wholesale markets, and will also help 
supply power  to Ameren customers, McDowall said.
