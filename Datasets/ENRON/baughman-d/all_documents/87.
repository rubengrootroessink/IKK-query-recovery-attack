I sent your message to our tech department to see if they can figure out if
there is a problem on our end. It looks like Doug emailed it to the correct
address so I can't imagine what the problem could be. Thanks for forwarding
us that.

Dinner last week was cancelled because Jeff wants to be there when we do get
together and he was busy last week. Rudy and Bobette have talked about
meeting for drinks sometime soon. Hope you can join us when we do meet.

I think y'all might want to check your e-mail server.  It looks to me that
my night guys have been e-mailing our contribution to your index.

Give me a call or e-mail me with any questions.
