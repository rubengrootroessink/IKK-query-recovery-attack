TradersNews Energy today officially launched its new hourly indexes for
ERCOT, TVA/SERC and ComEd/MAIN. As a result, we will no longer be e-mailing
you the indexes you have been receiving during our free, pre-launch
examination.

To ensure you keep getting the benefit of these exclusive price discovery
and hedging tools, call TradersNews Energy Sales toll free at 1-888-TNE-1006
to learn how you can subscribe.

The three new indexes join our original hourly indexes (and our daily and
forward indexes) for Cinergy, AEP/Northern ECAR and Entergy/SPP.

 All TradersNews Indexes are available through direct feeds or via our
website at www.tradersnewsenergy.com

                                        Visit Us at Energy Expo, Houston.
