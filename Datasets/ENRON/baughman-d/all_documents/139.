Thought you might like to see this...... the shit just continues...........




Hmmmmmm, 

Let's see if I can address these issues....

I'm not 45....... 

I do not have Hypercholesterolemia, I don't even know what it is........ nor 
do I have any cholesteral problems...... 

I don't have Hypertension.......... 

My father had diabetes..... I do not and do not have any problems as such....

AND my father died at 62.... not before age 55...... so your little check 
marks seem.... let's see......... without regard to intelligent recourse.  

Therefore, my request is for you clear me for Enron's Fitness Program or 
remove me from such consideration... as I WILL NOT be getting any physician's 
release for me to perform any additonal exercise... AND I won't have him 
signing any release for me to jog at Memorial Park....... OR play my usual 
softball three times a week.... or clear me for Spring skiing at 
Steamboat............. 
 
Thanks for your attention to details.... unfortunately, I think you are way 
off base here......... so either clear my application or quit wasting my 
time.  

Thanks... Richard
