As many of you have already noticed, this year Enron will be closing its 
offices on Monday, January 15 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  This 
is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain 
that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has 
decided that we will continue to do so in the future.

Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater 
holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our 
employees.   For a complete listing of Enron's holiday schedule, go to
