>TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES This, from a Canadian newspaper, it's worth
>sharing. America: The Good Neighbor. Widespread but only partial news
>coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
>Toronto
>by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator.? What follows is the
>full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:
>"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most
>generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the
>earth.Germany,
>Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the
>debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
>forgave
>other billions in debts.? None of these countries is today paying even the
>interest on its remaining debts to the United States. When France was in
>danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and
>their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris.? I
>was
>there.? I saw it. When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United
>States that hurries in to help.? This spring, 59 American communities were
>flattened by tornadoes.? Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman
>Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries.? Now
>newspapers
>in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.
>I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the
>erosion
>of the United States dollar build its own airplane.
>Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo
>Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC-10?? If so, why don't they
>fly
>them?? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American
>Planes?
>Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the
>moon?? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
>You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.? You talk about
>American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once, but several
>times - You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the
>store window for everybody to look at.? Even their draft dodgers are not
>pursued and hounded.They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless
>they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and
>pa
>at home to spend here. When the railways of France, Germany and India were
>breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.? When the
>Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned
>them
>an old caboose.? Both are still broke. I can name you 5000 times when the
>Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble.? Can you name me
>even
>one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?? I don't
>think
>there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our
>neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of
>hearing them get kicked around.? They will come out of this thing with
>their
>flag high.? And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the
>lands that are gloating over their present troubles.? I hope Canada is not
>one of those." Stand proud, America! Wear IT PROUDLY
>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ This is one of the best
>editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States.? It is nice
>that one man realizes it.? I only wish that the rest of the world would
>realize it.? We are always blamed for everything, and never even get a
>thank
>you for the things we do. I would hope that each of you would send this to
>as
>many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of
>their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web.? I am
>just a single American that has read this, I SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ
>IT SOON.
