Subject: RTO_SS Parallel Test Sessions


The SPP members completed the first of several scheduled parallel test
sessions of the new electronic scheduling system, RTO_SS.  This first
session was held on Friday, April 27 from 9am CDT to 1pm CDT.  There
were a total of 9 SPP Control Areas that participated during this
session.  Those Control Areas included; WR, KCPL, CSWS, WPEK, GRDA, MPS,
SPS, SPA, and CLEC.  Many thanks to all those companies that
participated!  We are hoping for a higher turnout at the next session.
If you do not plan to participate during these parallel test sessions,
please contact Barbara Gibson so arrangements can be made for your
schedule approvals.

These parallel test sessions are excellent opportunities for training
and practice on the new system with live data being imported into
RTO_SS.  During the times that parallel testing is NOT in session, users
can test additional functionality by creating their own sample tags and
taking the various actions on those associated schedules, i.e.
approving, denying, adjusting, canceling, etc.  The system is available
to users 24 hours per day.

There will be 3 more parallel test sessions this week and finally 3
sessions the following week. The sessions this week are scheduled for:

Tuesday, May 1 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Wednesday, May 2 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT
Friday, May 4 - 12pm CDT - 4pm CDT

Please refer to the attached document for more details regarding logins,
test information, etc.

We still do not have many sources and sinks set up for the different
Generation Providers and Load Serving Entities that wish to have direct
approval rights on the schedules.  If you are a GP or LSE and need to
get this data set up, please call Barbara Gibson or Shari Brown at SPP.
