Commission Closes Investigation Of FPE Circuit Breakers And Provides Safety 
Information For Consumers

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced today 
that it is closing its two year investigation into Federal Pacific Electric 
Stab-lok type residential circuit breakers. This action was taken because the 
data currently available to the Commission does not establish that the 
circuit breakers serious risk of injury to consumers.

The Commission investigation into Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) circuit 
breakers began in June, 1980, when Reliance Electric Co., a subsidiary of 
Exxon Corporation and the parent to FPE, reported to the Commission that many 
FPE circuit breakers did not fully comply with Underwriters Laboratories, 
Inc. (UL) requirements. Commission testing confirmed that these breakers fail 
certain UL calibration test requirements. The Commission investigation 
focused primarily on 2 pole residential circuit breakers manufactured before 
Reliance acquired FPE in 1979.

To meet UL standards, residential circuit breakers must pass a number of 
so-called "calibration tests." The purpose of these tests is to determine 
whether the circuit breakers will hold the  current for which they are rated 
and also automatically open or  "trip" (shut off the current) within 
specified time limits if over-loading of the circuit causes current levels in 
excess of the breaker's amperage rating. (Overloading can occur because a 
consumer plugs too many products into a circuit or due to the failure of a 
product or component connected to that circuit). While the Commission is 
concerned about the failure of these FPE breakers to meet UL calibration 
requirements, the Commission is unable at this time to link these failures to 
the development of a hazardous situation.

According to Reliance, failures of these FPE breakers to comply with certain 
UL calibration requirements do not create a hazard in the household 
environment. It is Reliance's position that FPE breakers will trip reliably 
at most overload levels unless the breakers have been operated in a 
repetitive, abusive manner that should not occur during residential use. 
Reliance maintains that, at those few overload levels where FPE breakers may 
fail to trip under realistic use conditions, currents will be too low to 
generate hazardous temperatures in household wiring. Reliance believes its 
position in this regard is supported by test data that it provided to the 
Commission.

The Commission staff believes that it currently has insufficient data to 
accept or refute Reliance's position.

The Commission staff estimates that it would cost several million dollars to 
gather the data necessary to assess fully whether those circuit breakers 
which are installed in homes but which may fail UL calibration tests present 
a risk to the public. Based on the Commission's limited budget ($34 million 
for fiscal year 1983), the known hazards the Commission has identified and 
must address (involving products of other manufacturers) and the uncertainty 
of the results of such a costly investigation, the Commission has decided not 
to commit further resources to its investigation of FPE's circuit breakers. 
However, despite its decision to close this particular investigation, the 
Commission will continue its investigation of circuit breakers generally. The 
Commission can reopen its investigation of FPE circuit breakers if further 
information warrants.

The Commission advises consumers to take certain safety precautions with all 
circuit breakers and fuses. Consumers should:

Know your electrical circuit. Know which outlets and products are connected 
to each circuit.


Never overload any electrical circuit by connecting too many products to the 
circuit. Be particularly careful not to connect several products that demand 
high current (such as heating appliances) to a low amperage circuit.


Comply with local building codes in wiring or adding electrical circuits. 
Make sure the wiring and devices used in the circuit are connected to a 
circuit breaker or fuse of the proper size.


Immediately disconnect any electrical product if problems develop. Have the 
product examined by a competent repair person.


Investigate to determine why a fuse blows or circuit breaker  trips. Do not 
simply replace the fuse or reset the breaker. If a fuse blows or breaker 
trips, it is often a warning that the circuit is overloaded. Check the 
circuit for causes of overloading (for example, too many appliances plugged 
in, a malfunctioning product, a short circuit). When in doubt, consult a 
licensed electrician.

Consumers who have questions concerning circuit breakers, or who wish to 
report information relating to their safety, may call the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission's toll-free safety hotline at 800-638-CPSC, 
teletypewriter for the hearing impaired at 800-638-8270 (Maryland only 
800-492-8104).
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from 
unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer products 
under the agency's jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a 
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, 
call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 
638-8270.  To order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release number.  
Consumers can obtain this release and recall information or report product 
hazards to info@cpsc.gov.
