Subject:   OASIS 1.4 Conversion on 3/1/2001 Update


This is a notice to update the OASIS users on the status of the MAPP
implementation of the 1.4 version of OASIS.

Several processes are on-going in an effort to meet the March 1, 2001 OASIS
1.4 production date.  These include:

1. Communication process:

   a. OASIS Workshop: Feb 14-16:
There were 88 workshop attendees.

   b. For the OASIS users who were unable to attend this Workshop and are
still interested in taking the class, MAPP Staff is offering two more
classes
on March 20-21. There will be two more lecture / lab sessions, the first
starting the morning of the 20th and ending late in the day on the 20th, the
second starting midday on the 20th and ending midday on the 21st, and the
third starting the morning of the 21st and ending late in the day on the
21st. Please send an email (if you have not already
done so) to sl.duncan@mapp.org or call at (651) 632-8422 if you are
interested in attending one of these classes.

2.  Implementation process:

   a. OASIS 1.4 Beta Releases and bug fixes continue to be released by ESCA
(the JTSIN vendor) on a daily basis.  The production software release will
be on Friday, February, 23:

OASIS 1.4 Beta Release #3 is located at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3
The only requirement to use this test node is a valid Tradewave certificate.
Please send an email to ds.fredrickson@mapp.org to indicate any problems
that are encountered while testing this beta release.

   b. MAPP Validation and Request Evaluation Processes revised:
MAPP Staff is working with OATI to implement the modifications required to
the automated processes due to the OASIS 1.4 changes.  Testing will continue
through the
month of February.

   c. February 28 / March 1 Cutover Plan

The OASIS 1.4 functionality specified by FERC includes numerous changes to
business practices and OASIS requirements.   The JTSIN group is modifying
the OASIS to be compliant.  Members and Staff need to be prepared to perform
the cutover to OASIS 1.4 during a 12 hour period beginning at 1800 on
February 28 and ending 0600 on March 1.

Our objective is to cutover to OASIS 1.4 within two hours.  This is,
however, a best case scenario, so customers should be prepared for a more
extended outage of OASIS.

All communication from the MAPP Center just prior to and during the cutover
wil be via e-mail and the MCN.

E-mail communication during the cutover will be via the rin@mapp.org  list
only.

All communication sent via rin@mapp.org will also be broadcast to all MCN
sites.

Telephone communication, if necessary, should be done through the
Transaction Coordinator Help Line (651) 632 - 8508.

Cutover Schedule  (Tentative; best case scenario)

February 28, 2001

1800   Shut down access to the MAPP OASIS by the outside world.
Complete processing of all requests currently residing on OASIS.

1815   Shut down all OASIS and related backend applications.
Back up OASIS 1.3 databases.

1830   Perform OASIS 1.4 database and software modifications.

1930   Start up modified backend applications.
      Test processing of transmission requests.

2000   Enable access to the MAPP OASIS by the outside world.

Processing of Transmission Requests During Shutdown

It is preferable that no transmission requests be received during the
shutdown.  Customers are requested to complete as much business prior to
shutdown as possible, and to enter any transactions that occur during the
shutdown after-the-fact when OASIS is back on-line.   Customers must be
prepared to submit requests in OASIS 1.4 formats when OASIS comes back
on-line, and realize that this may be prior to midnight.  If prevailing
transmission system conditions allow, short duration tags will be accepted
without reservations during the shutdown, at the discretion of the Senior
Security Center Operator on duty and the Transaction Coordinator on duty.

If it appears that the shutdown will last longer than two hours, alternative
means of accepting transmission requests may be implemented.


Thank you.
