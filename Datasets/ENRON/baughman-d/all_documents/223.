   1. Introduction

   So, who the heck is LoneStarMusic.com? Well, as it says
   on our home page, we're the "True Sound of Texas." Of
   course, one man's true might be another man's trouble.

   So, what do we think true some Texan sounds are? Hmmm . . .
   acoustic guitars. Steel guitars. Townes Van Zandt's blues.
   Kelly Willis' voice. The Brothers Robison and the Sisters
   Damnation. Electric lounges, armadillos, and Do-Wacka-Do.
   Texas tornados. Broken spokes. Pat Green, Gruene Hall,
   and Lubbock (on everything). Lucky Dogs, Lost Gonzos,
   and lots and lots of Gourds.

   Whatever Willie Nelson says it is.

   2. Mission Statement

   LoneStarMusic.com wants to provide an outlet for independent,
   roots-aware Texas musicians. (As for what those roots are,
   please reference previous section). Texas has produced a
   striking amount of great, original music, and only a corporate
   behemoth can cover all of that real estate. I think we're doing
   our part, though, attempting to represent smaller artists - like
   ourselves - who are trying to get a handle on the many
   elemental influences that tug on you when you live in Texas.
   That's why we're not standing still. LoneStarMusic.com wants
   to become a full resource for Texas music. We want to provide
   information, sounds, graphics, books, and anything else that
   might help us musically navigate the ought-oughts. The future
   will include an expanded version of what Texas music is and
   who it has influenced. For now, please honor the words of
   Bob Wills ... and stay a little longer.

   6. Interview With A Craftsman - Guy Clark
      Introduction by Sunny Sweeney

   Born and raised in West Texas, Guy Clark has always stayed
   true to his Lone Star roots when it comes to songwriting.
   In this rare interview, Chad Raney, President of Lonestarmusic.com,
   gets the chance to chat with the Godfather of Texas Songwriting.
   Clark talks about his personal inspirations and shares his
   secrets to writing songs. Everyone who is anyone in Texas music
   today has been inspired in some way by this writing genius and
   musical trendsetter. Clark talks about his friendships with
   Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle and Verlon Thompson
   and reveals how his wife's brutal honesty has helped him write
   many of his amazing songs.

   7. Artist of the Month - The Groobees

   The Groobees are a Texas music band in just about every sense of
   the term as well as the words within it. First of all, they are
   one of those musical units that is genuinely a band. One can hear
   the interplay and feel the unity in the melodies and grooves they
   create together. When it comes to being musical, The Groobees not
   only offer a vast range of instrumental accents, lacing accordion,
   mandolin, and banjo over guitars(both electric and acoustic),
   keyboards, bass, and drums, but create songs that carry stories,
   imagery, emotions, and meaning in the lyrics along with giving
   each player the room to shine. And while they may not sing about
   such overworked Lone Star State subjects as beer, dancehalls, and
   two-stepping, The Groobees do reflect the breadth and depth of the
   music found in Texas, flavoring their songs with elements of rock,
   country, folk, pop, blues, and more. And getting back to just how
   much The Groobees are a genuine band, that fact is also revealed
   in how all that they do comes out sounding like nobody else but
   The Groobees.
