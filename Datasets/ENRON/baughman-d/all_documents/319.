> This pretty much sums it up for me.

> I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some midlevel
> governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to
> crack addicts squirting out babies.
>
> I don't care about appearing compassionate.
>
> I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer - I believe
ignoring
> your kids and giving them Prozac might.
>
> I think I'm doing better than the homeless.
>
> I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.
>
> I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different,
> weird or make me mad. This is my life to live, and not necessarily up to
> others expectations.
>
> I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it.
>
> I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. But if you want to that's fine; just don't feel
> like everyone else should have to.
>
> I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a pack of
> cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English. As of matter of fact, if
you
> are an American citizen you should speak English. My uncles and
forefathers
> shouldn't have had to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were
> born in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will. Get over
it.
>
> I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if you're
running
> from them after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word
> 'freeze' or 'stop' in English, see the previous line.
>
> I don't use the excuse "it's for the children" as a shield for unpopular
> opinions or actions.
>
> I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no
> political affiliation do a recount when needed.
>
> I know what the definition of lying is, and it isn't based on the word

>
> I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you qualify

can

> I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.
>
> I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.
>
> I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.
>
> I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T or
> Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to listen to that crap
> from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a red light. But I respect
your
> right to do so.

> I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than
> working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.
>
> I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite or
fat-free
> on the package.
>
> Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in
vain
> and defend our Constitution so that decades later you can tell me it's a

>
> I don't hate the rich.
>
> I help the poor.
>
> I know wrestling is fake.
>
> I've never owned, or was a slave, and a large percentage of our
forefathers

> some prior white people were idiots -- and remember, tons of white,
Indian,
> Chinese, and other races have been enslaved too -- it was wrong for every

> I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than a

> I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and
continue

> I don't believe in hate crime legislation. Even suggesting it makes me
mad.
> You're telling me that someone who is a minority, gay, disabled, another

has

> I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.
