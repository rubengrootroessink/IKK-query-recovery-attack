We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to 
co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to 
run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint 
accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the 
reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the 
effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring 
efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to 
develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson 
will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired 
generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation 
Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter 
integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at 
Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years 
building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years 
managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident 
that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success.
