As some of you know I have recently relocated to London to join the Shell
crude oil trading team. While I don't yet have a permanent flat address
(hopefully I'll have that taken care of in the next week), I do have some
contact info in the meantime.

Work phone #:  011.44.20.7546.2381
Mobile phone #: 011.44.781.018.2647
Fax #: 011.44.20.7546.4448
e-mail:  Charles.C.Uus@stasco.com

Once I get a flat address and telephone number I'll forward that along as
well.

Hopefully if some of you find yourselves in London in the future we will be
able to get together.

Regards,

Charles
