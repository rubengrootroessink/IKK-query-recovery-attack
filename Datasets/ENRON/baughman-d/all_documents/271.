Kayne,

We have discussed the real-time books being flat by 6:30 A.M. in the past and 
I just want to reiterate the importance of that task.  We run a report that 
checks the east positions to ensure that we as a company are flat on a daily 
basis.  Every morning that I can remember for the past few weeks one or all 
of the real-time desks are not flat with the term or cash books causing our 
group to spend time finding the problem and than fixing it.  We have a noon 
deadline to report P&L to  upper management.  When we miss this deadline we 
are forced to document the causes to the Corporate reporting group.  We are 
normally able to rush through and meet our deadline in the nick of time.  
Could you please institute a policy in which the night group checks the 
positions and ensures that all of the real-time desks are flat prior to 6:30 
A.M.  I know we keep bugging you about this problem but it needs to be 
addressed as we have reached a point where our group cannot even start our 
daily tasks until 9:30 - 10:00 every day.  When we came in this morning the 
only real-time desk to be flat was the Hourly Midwest desk.  Let me know if 
our group can help in any way.


Thank you
Donnie Vinson
