Thank you for choosing Time Warner Road Runner as your high-speed online  
provider. After a search of our database your address was found to be  
non-serviceable at this time. While our system does serve your zip code, 
your  particular part of the zip code has not been upgraded. We are adding 
you to a  list of persons to contact when we have expanded our service area 
to reach you.  

A card will be sent to the address where service was requested giving an  
approximate upgrade date. The card includes a special offer of FREE 
installation  and a FREE month of Road Runner service. Please keep the card 
as this offer  cannot be processed without it.

Thank you again for choosing Time Warner Road Runner and we look forward to  
serving you in the near future.
