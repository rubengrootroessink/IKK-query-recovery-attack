Don,
I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

How was Vegas?

Regards,
Jeff
