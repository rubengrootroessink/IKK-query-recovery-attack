Fletch,

Shannon and I want to thank you for the great weekend at Del Lago.  We enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was nice to get to know and socialize with everyone and their families.  I think that we'll find that it will be very beneficial on the desk, due to stronger personal relationships between team members. 

Thanks again,

Don
