Big tits and Paul....one of the same...Hey dude you know that chick I meet
at the Stampede...well she called me last wednesday 3 times but I had the
chick form NY at my house for 3 nights and so I could only call her on

is now disconnected....The caller Id when she called my house is from her
home....DO I call her there....hummm...I will try that number tonight!
