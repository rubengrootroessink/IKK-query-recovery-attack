Stock symbol ENE, Company that you would be working for is Enron America's or Enron North America.  There should be an Enron web site.  Enron.com

when you get a sec, would you kindly send me the symbol(s) for Enron.  I'd 
like to check them out stock wise, and is there a good web site I can look 
at you find out a little more about the company?  There are quite a few 
different Enron's, and I'm not sure who's who.  Tanks a latte!
