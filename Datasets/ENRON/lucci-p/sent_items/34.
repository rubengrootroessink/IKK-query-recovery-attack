I'm glad you had a good time.  I did also.  Yes, keep me posted on your happy hour.  I talked to Bob this morning and explained your frustrations and that you have him on your S___ List.  So he said he would like to talk to you.  So you see, once again I have served you well.

Good morning.  Just wanted to say thanks again for dinner last night.  I
had fun.

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make it
to bed until 10:30 again so I only got 6 hours of sleep.  Makes for a "many
coca cola afternoon".

Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be.
