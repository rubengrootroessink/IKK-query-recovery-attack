Hey baby!  I just love it when your little messages "pop" up.  I don't know 
if Mark's made up his mind yet, but I have a pretty good feeling about it.  
If (when) I officially have the job, you ought to take me out to lunch, 
seeing how you'd be one of my big, bad bosses!  Not to mention, I'm reduced 
to a poor working woman again.  Is there a dress code in the office?  What 
are your plans for later this week?
