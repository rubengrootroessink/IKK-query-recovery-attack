You are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.  Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you. I like to keep everything short and sweet. So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.  You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.  Too bad the car is full.  And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance.

Just wanted to say hello.  I have much more free time on my hands than you, 
so you have to tell me if I am bothering you too much.  I like your 
attention, even though you are obviously not a phone man.  Get your ankle 
checked out so that you can take me dancing again!
