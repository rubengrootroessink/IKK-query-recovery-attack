Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Then weeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.
 
 
Thanks

Paul,
 
Sunday's good, let me know if you need to change, otherwise I'll set up about 8 or 10 places to see.
