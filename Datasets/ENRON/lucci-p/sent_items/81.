Paul & Stan

Here is our purchase proposal we have been sending out for renewal on our purchase agreements.  We have left it somewhat open ended to account for differences in the individual gas packages.  Please review this proposal, as I will be calling you shortly to discuss any changes or questions you have to the proposal.  You can reach me at (303) 575-6474.


Sincerely,

Paul Lucci
