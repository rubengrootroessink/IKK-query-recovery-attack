I briefed Scott, +8 into WIC & +1 CIG Wind, both at the mid.  I'm thinking about the 2000 A8, they start in the low 50's.  I think I'll take out a loan and secure it with Enron stock and stock options!

Paul--

I know its early and prices are way down, however in preparation for the Lost Creek Members Meeting, could you please give me an idea of the spread across Lost Creek for December baseload deals?

Thanks bro.
