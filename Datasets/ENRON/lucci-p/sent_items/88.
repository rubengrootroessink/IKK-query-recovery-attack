We can cover the airport so you don't have too.  Just tell everyone we will be at the airport between 1:00 and 5:00ish.

Guys,

Looks like Will & Paul will be arriving @ DFW around the same time on Friday.
Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.

Paul's Info:
Airline: United
Flt #:  1670
Time: 1:00 pm 

Paul's Pager:     888.773.1942

See you guys Friday.  Please get fresh haircuts and shower before you arrive on Friday; and as always dress to impress.
