I will call her.  I need to give my hair about two weeks to grow out.  Has she started to date again.  I thought she had given up on men after her divorce?  When are you going to get your hair cut?  I've got a date with Karen this week, well at least I think I do.  Have you talked to Larry about Friday?

I can't do lunch this week.  Why don't you plan to pay me at the Halloween
party.  You are a stud at picking teams.  Have you been to see Brandi yet?
You need to call her and set up a hair appointment, 623-4222.  Bob

Bob,

What about me picking two winning teams last weekend.  Can you send me
the latest updated version of the pool.  Also what about lunch later
this week so I can get you your money.  Tell Larry we are going to party
Friday, so he better go along.

Paul
