I would LOVE to meet for lunch on Wednesday!  I am so bored and lonely 
today, glad you shot me an e-mail.  Planning to go to the club later tonight 
so hopefully I'll be in prime hot tub condition!  I know I keep bugging you, 
but I can't help it.  I feel so completely isolated at times and I just keep 
reaching out.  Hope you don't mind coddling me every now and again.  I had 
such a great time last friday when I came into town for the so called 
"interview".  So nice to meet new people and hang out.  Can't wait to come 
to work with everyone, it seems like a great office.  Ready to get into an 
early morning workout regime as well, but mostly I just want something to 
fill my day.  Don't I sound pathetic today...yuck!
