 The Weakest link'
 ..

 Are you the weakest link???

 I am going to ask you three questions.

 And you have to answer them instantly.

 You can't take your time.

 You have to answer immediately.

 O.K.?  Don't  cheat.

 Let's find out just how clever you really are

 ........... ........

 Ready?

 ..

 GO !!!!!

 ..

 First Question

 ..

 You are participating in a race. You overtake the second place runner.

 What position do you finish?

 ...

 NOW! See the answer below..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer

 ..

 If you answered that you finish first, you are absolutely wrong!!!

 Why? Because when you overtake the second place runner and

 you take his place, you finish in second place!!

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you

 took for the first question.

 ..

 ..

 Second Question:   If you overtake the last runner then you arrive...?

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer: If you answer that you arrived second to last, you are wrong
again.

                   Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST runner !!!!

                   The question is wrong!

                You're not very good at this are you???

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Third Question

 ..

 Subject: *Very, very tricky math!

 Note:   This riddle must be done IN YOUR HEAD ONLY

                and NOT using paper and a pen.

 ..

 Try it.

 ..

 Take 1000 and add 40 to it.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 30.

 Add another 1000.

 Now add 20.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 10.

 ..

 What is the total? (scroll down for answer)

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Did you get 5000?

 ..

 The correct answer is actually 4100.

 ..

 Don't believe it? Check it with your calculator!

 ..

 The decimal sequence confuses our brain that always jumps to the

 highest decimals (100s instead of 10s).

 ..

 This should have you in a bad mood for the rest of the day!!!

 ..

 You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
