The concert was great!  We had box seats so we drank for free, which is always a plus.  As far as Enron goes we definitely need this Dynegy deal!  What's up with you this weekend?  We are going to the wine tasting thing on Saturday, right?  What about Friday night want to play doctor?

Just wanted to see how the concert was and find out what you think about 
Dynegy possibly buying out Enron.  Is that a good or bad thing, or does it 
even matter?
