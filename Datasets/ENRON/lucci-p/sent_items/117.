Did I upset you?  I hope I didn't tell you anything you didn't already know.

Alrighty then.  Hope you have a fantastic Thanksgiving, say Hi to Kim and 
Danny for me.  I am assuming that Mark and Alicia will be there too?  I 
guess I'll see you sometime next week.  Hear Heidi's getting the axe on 
Monday. YIPPEE
