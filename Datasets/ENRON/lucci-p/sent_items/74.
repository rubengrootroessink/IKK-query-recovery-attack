Hello you guys,
 
Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!
 
Paul
 
PS  We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!
