Sooner Fans & Friends,

Just a quick note to let everyone know some of the OU - tx party pics have been posted .  More pictures will be added soon. 

Here's the URL -> http://www.gladwin.net/outx2001/outx2001Pics/outexas2001.html


I'd like to ask everyone to send Doug a thank you note for letting us use his pool again this year; I know he would appreciate it. 

Doug Anderson

I had a great time and it was good to see everyone!  I'm looking forward to doing it again next year. 


Boomer Sooner,
Michael
