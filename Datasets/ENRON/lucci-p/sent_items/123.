The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.

Paul, thanks for the note... do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of MTM or payables/receivables? 

Like everyone else, the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but I wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.
