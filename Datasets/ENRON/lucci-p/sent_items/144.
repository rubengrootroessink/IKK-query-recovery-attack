Hey you.  I just came back to my office, the one I'm moving into once all the construction is over.  Only the contractor pulled out and all construction has come to a stop!  The contractor, Todd, isn't acting all that honestly in this bankruptcy stage.  Where and what time do you want to meet tomorrow?

Good morning!  another busy day at the office.  i almost bagged the gym
today to sleep in, but dragged my butt out of bed at the last moment and
went in to do cardio.  i have been a machine lately at the gym.  I think
I've worked out every day except two in the last couple of weeks.  tomorrow
will be another early morning with my trainer.  Did some volunteer work
with the junior league last night for a couple hours.  we did some crafts
with the families over at Warren Village, a single parent housing project.
It was eye-opening, to say the least.  I need that every once in a while as
a reality check on my "charmed life".  Have been working furiously to make
arrangements to fly to Asia for the holidays.  Plan to fly to Hong Kong,
then spend Christmas in Vietnam and New Year's in Shanghai.  All this is
last minute, so it's costing a bloody fortune, but it should be
spectacular.  wish i had saved up $$prior to making this decision.  now my
camera is broken so i'm trying to possibly buy a new one before the trip.
i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm broke and will be going into
debt unless i decide to sell some stock (at a loss).  Got any Enron stock
on ya?  kidding.

Saw Larry Bevins last week at Marlowe's and he gushed on and on about what
a great guy you are.  I didn't believe a word he said, but I'm wondering
how much you're paying him.  Or perhaps other favors are exchanged?

Definitely up for a drink tomorrow after work.  will call later.
