Subject: Match.com - You've Got Mail: Hello from Boulder


Hello!
I'm a fun, 33 year old Boulder native, CU grad and work in advertising.  I'm funny, independent and outgoing.  I love my life but desire to have someone to share it with, now since most of my friends are married and starting to have children.  It makes the social opportunities less available and spontanious...I'm sure you can relate.

I love my life and own my own place in Boulder which I share with my adored dog, Buddy.  I'm a huge Buff fan and wish I could go to the Fiesta Bowl for new years.

WHat about you?  WHere did you go to school?  Do you love working in Denver?  The social scene is so great!  Lots to do, great restaurants, fun bars.  I worked there prior to taking my job here in Boulder...I really miss it.

Anyhow, I hope you are having fun and a good repsonse from your ad.  You have a great smile and eyes!  I hope to hear back from you so I can learn more about you!

Take Care,
C

The following is my profile text:

I am a fun, creative, honest, grounded, outgoing Colorado native, CU grad and work in advertising. I love Colorado and enjoy the beauty of my state everyday driving to work looking at the Flatirons. I am lucky to be culturaly diverse and well traveled. Although I am not very athletic, I do enjoy spectator sports but prefer the cultural arts. My friends describe me loyal and true blue.
