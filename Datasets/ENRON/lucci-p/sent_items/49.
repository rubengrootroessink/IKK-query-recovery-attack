-- Yeah, its the same gal.  She is alot of fun, even though she does 
bad things!!  All of her friends are fun too, so it should be a good 
time. Canadians always put on fun parties  I think she invited Russ 
Moran too.  Give me a call if you would like to go and maybe we can 
just meet at my house and go from here since it is right up the 
block.  Are you going to be at the IPAMS reception tomorrow night?
Talk to you soon
