I can't believe it!  Why?  Well good luck in whatever you do.  It's always been a pleasure to work with you and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  You should look to come skiing now that you have some time off.

Take Care
Paul

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.
