I totally agree, I was extremely stupid.  I'm not kidding, I already have a funny sensation just like I used to get when I was back in OKC.  What was I thinking?

Paul,

I hope you're kidding, but you should probably go get your stuff
checked just in case.  While you're at it you might want to get the prostate
checked too; depending
on your doctor is can actually be a great experience.  My doctor is a hot
blonde female with long
skinny fingers.  Oh I think I'm feeling sick and should go see her again
soon!

Lesson learned, "If you're not going to sack it, take it home and wack it."

Later
