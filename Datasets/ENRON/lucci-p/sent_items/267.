I'm looking forward to it also.  I may not do the ski training class tonight, I'm worried about my ankle.  So, if I don't I'll be ready around 6:30.  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk later.

Hey you...I was still planning on coming down for dinner, unless you've made 
other plans.  Looking forward to it!
