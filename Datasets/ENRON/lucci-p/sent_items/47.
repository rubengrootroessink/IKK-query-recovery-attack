What time should I meet you at your house on Saturday?  I'm not going to the reception tonight.  Shoot me back directions to your house.

I live in Hunters Glen....just east of 136th and Washington.  The 
Club House is about 6 blocks from where I live so that is 
good....walking distance if needed!!  The IPAMS reception is tonight 
at Maggiano's from what I hear.  Are you going?
