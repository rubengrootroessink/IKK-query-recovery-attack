What's up you two losers, and I mean losers!  Anyway, since I have to take time out of my busy schedule and lower myself to your standards here is my itinerary so pay close attention.

I arrive Friday October 5th
	Airline:  United
	Flight:	1478
	Airport:  DFW
	Time:	2:21 pm (arrive Dallas)

I leave Sunday at 12:50 pm

I booked two rooms at the Holiday Inn Express, they are in my name but are not paid for yet.  I'll give them a credit card when I get there.  One of the rooms has a King only and the other room has two beds but it's a smoking room, that's all they had.  So smoke um if you got um!  Both rooms have an additional pull out bed, FYI.  I'm looking forward to this weekend, go UT!!!!!!!!!!


Your Master
