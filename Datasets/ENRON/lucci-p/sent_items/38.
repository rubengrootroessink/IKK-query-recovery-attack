Beer is fine with me.  So you have to drive Greg around all day Saturday.  That should be a perfect time to talk to him about his wife's fondness with other men.  And since Russ is going to the party will there be a fight?  This party is going to be exciting!

What do you want to drink?  I think Greg (Corinnes husband) is 
getting a Keg, Scotch and alot of wine!  I have wine and Vodka at my 
house (gotta have a pre-party cocktail), so if you want something 
else tell me now!!  Other than that, I am bringing Brie, and I think 
that will cover our part.  If you can't get ahold of me Saturday 
afternoon, call my cell, because Greg cannot drive and I have to take 
him on some errands for the party.
