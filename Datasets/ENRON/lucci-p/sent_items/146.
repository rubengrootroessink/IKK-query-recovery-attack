What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers 
are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.

Later for now
The Looch

So what's up with you?   I hear that your company is going through a little change to put in mildly......
 
So you are still set from what Mike told me.    Dang it..... I guess you're still the rich one and I'm the pretty one..... I guess I can't be both...
 
So how is everything else? Still up for a ski trip????? I sure hope so. I don't know which I look forward to more, the ski trip or Vegas baby......   Snow Skiing is my favorite sport type activity.... unless you count Olympic "Belly wrestling"..... But the trip to Vegas was fun.....Sun and fun- plus the women are wearing less.
 
Check out the new bed I made for my guest room. I sold the last bed.  I hope Mike won't break this bed with his big women action... Oh sorry that's Brian that likes the "Full figured" women.
 
Later Heavy-D
