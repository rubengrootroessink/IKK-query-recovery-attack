Yes I'm going to the luncheon today.  I also brought jeans, but I too am wearing a skirt so I won't deprive YOU of a look at MY legs.

I'm wearing green today.  No, I'm not going to wear jeans tonight.  I
thought about it, then decided against it.  I didn't want to deprive you of
a good look at my legs, so I wore a skirt.  Are you going to the COGA
annual meeting/lunch (I only go because of the free food) today?

Hey Jack needs to only talk to me.  And, what color are you wearing?  I
would hold on Enron stock for now.  I think it is a long term buy but I
don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get
a better price if you wait.  Are you wearing Jeans tonight.

Jack Vaughn is in our office right now.  He just walked into my office
and
said (like always) "Hey, Gorgeous!  Wow, that's a great color for your
eyes."  And my boss still doesn't quite seem to get it when I tell him
it
is often difficult for a woman to be taken seriously in this industry.

Is Enron stock a good buy at $8?
