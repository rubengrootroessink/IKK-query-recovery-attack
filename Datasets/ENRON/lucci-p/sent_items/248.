Hello;

How are you today?  I talked to Alicia she is going to talk to you then provided everything is cool, which I think it is, she'll buy the tickets and I'll pay Mark.  So, I've got you covered.  What do you have going on Friday.  Want to come over to my house and play?  I'll be out the majority of the day but write me back.

Paul
