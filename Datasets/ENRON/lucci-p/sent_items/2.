That's a Wednesday night?  Are clothes involved?  And can I take pictures?

Mr. Lucci,

Are you free on the evening of November 7?  If you are, are you also
prepared to be indebted to me for the rest of your natural life?  If the
answer is still "yes", please plan on spending that evening with me.  Let
me know.  Details to follow.
