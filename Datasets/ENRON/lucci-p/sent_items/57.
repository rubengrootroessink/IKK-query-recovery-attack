The deal was done with Field Services and we should change our deal ticket "counter party" to reflect that.

Thanks 
Paul

Paul,

We have the above Sep-01 production deal on WIC pipeline in the system under CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company.  However, the counterparty is billing us under CMS Field Services, Inc.  These two counterparties settle differently.  Please confirm the correct counterparty name if possible.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
