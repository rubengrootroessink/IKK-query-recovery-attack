Paul,

I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as Glen Rock is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.  We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.  Anything after that is anyone's guess.  If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.  Hope all is well, and watch out for CU!

Paul

What kind of CIG pricing can a PRB producer get for selling gas in the Powder if you were to buy gas at Deadhorse and Glenrock?

Thanks,

Paul
