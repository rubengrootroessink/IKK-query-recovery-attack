You can be my personal assistant.  What's up with you on Saturday night?  Are you feeling any better today?  Don't worry it will all work out!

Hey you!  Hope your Dr's visit goes/went well.  Fix that ankle, you are 
going to need it to run around with me!  Thanks for being such a cooperative 
little phone man last night.  Very nice of you to listen to my whining.  
Getting ready to head to the club...had Halloween parties this morning.  
Busy, busy girl.  Gotta find a lucrative job...got any bright ideas?  
Squeeze ya later! - Moi
