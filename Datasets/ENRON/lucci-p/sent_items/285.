Many of you, I know, will appreciate this.


PHILOSOPHY 101

A philosophy professor stood before his class. He picked up a large empty
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the
students if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor
picked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand
filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you to
recognize that this is your life.

"The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your
health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only
they  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.
The small stuff.

"If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.
The same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the
small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to
you."

But then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor
agreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the
beer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.


The moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is
always room for BEER.
