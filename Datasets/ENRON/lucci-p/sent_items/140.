The following is my profile text:

My name ia Anne. I just moved to Colorado from Florida in August. I'm almost divorced and ready to start meeting people.I'm starting a business in Feb, but until then I've got some extra time on my hands.I'm attrative,hardworking,honest, loving,attentive,creative,smart,intuitive, confident.I love to dance!(I'll make you the envy of all the men in the club,but I'll always go home with you!).Take me out in public (I shine in social situations) or keep me home at night( I shine their too!)I'm happiest when I have that special someone in my life who will share my experiences and involve me in his.There is so much I want to do (any outside activity) yet indoor activites have there advantages too.Falling in "Love" is always Fun yet making new friends is'nt so "Bad" either. If we meet, you can bet we'll laugh, if we have chemistry..all the better! Anyway, whatelse do you have to do!
