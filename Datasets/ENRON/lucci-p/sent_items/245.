Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the Enron stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.

I just recevied my reply from the Brazilian ski team and it looks like we're on between 16 Feb - 3 Mar.  Let's
start thinking about when we want to go and get something booked.  Paul, start thinking about where we
would want to stay in Vail.
 
Later
 


H i Michael, good to rear from you.How are you and the guys doing?Did you pratice enough to ski with us again?Ii t will be great to meet you again.

In despite to be insane  thinking in traveling to USA at this moment, we are buyin our tikets this week and also hiding our passports so our parents will not forbt us to ski.Everybody says we are crazy and we are,crazy for ski...

We will be in Vail from feb 16 till march 3,the first week we will be in an apartament and then we will move to another place, probably in Eeagle,25 miles from Vail were I know a small hotel very cheap

How  the life is going on with all this mess? Are you affraid?

I hope you can set-up the dates ,it is so nice to meet someone and keep seeing even living so far.See you soon, take care,P
