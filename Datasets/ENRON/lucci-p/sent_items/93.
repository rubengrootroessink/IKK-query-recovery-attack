Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;



Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.


I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Paul

Paul, can you please advise as to who you are directing these packages to and the status of their interest.
