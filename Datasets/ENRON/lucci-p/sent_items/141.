Carole,

Wow you are really bringing me down!  No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.  I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.  If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to Denver and I'll take you skiing!

Paul

This may be too early, but just in case....I will save the good-byes until they become absolutely necessary.

Could I have your outside e-mails and possibly your phone #'s?  If you feel uncomfortable giving these to me, that is o.k.  The following is my information.
