The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!

Hey Looch!!

Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything that
could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
not....unless its good news of course.

Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team has
potential.   They should do ok.

What's new with you?

LB
