We ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in Houston.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  
 
What did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP?
