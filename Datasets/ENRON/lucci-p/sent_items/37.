Ruth,

Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.  It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.  I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.


Paul
