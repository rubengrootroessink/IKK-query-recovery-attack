Hello,

I ran across you picture and found you to be very attractive, and after reading your "bio" I thought I'd drop you a line.  My name is Paul, I live on the north side of town and work downtown.  I noticed you work downtown? 
Anyway I'm sending you my profile, if there is any interest I'd love to hear from you!

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
