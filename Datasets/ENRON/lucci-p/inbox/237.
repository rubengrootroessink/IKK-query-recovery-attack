Hello,

I don't know if you received my first email, but since I'm new to this service I figured I'd write again.  Anyway, I found you to be very attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along my profile so you can get an idea as to who I am.  

I have been divorced for about 2 years and although I don't have any children of my own, I don't have a problem with girls that do!  

I would like to talk to you more, so if you feel the same way drop me a line.  I hope to hear from you.

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
