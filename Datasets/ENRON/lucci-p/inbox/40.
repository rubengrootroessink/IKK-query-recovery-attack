Dear Paul,

Hope you are ok. I keep hearing about Enron on TV and I'm worried for you.
I've had the flu...my first time in 30 years so I'm grounded for a few 
days...It's been warm here....that's the way I like it!! Take it easy...

I spoke to Allie and Jessie..they are cute to say the least.

Love, 
Kay
