being outdoors, I like to play soccer, basketball, riding bikes, hiking,
skiing, fishing, camping, and riding horses.

passion trip 
My life as a walk in the woods: The air ripples with sunshine, spotted

No longer experiencing Technical Difficulties 
I am a recent transplant to Denver after living the last 12 years in
L.A. I moved to Colorado to escape the rat race, be close to family,
regroup, and see where my life goes from here. I've quickly discovered

AM I LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES?

Anything has to be easier than the bar scene. I
