Ok, ok, you big nag!! Really, I'm sorry I didn't write back sooner; it was =
a really quick weekend and I wasn't online, then it's already been a really=
 busy couple days at work... the quick weekend was b/c yes, I travel for wo=
rk and with the #$% airline issues caused by the 11th, this week I left hom=
e at 1:00pm Sunday to catch a 3:30 flight to Philly, which is where I've be=
en commuting to on a weekly basis for nearly a year. While i travel every w=
eek for work, I really like travelling for fun, too. Preferably out of the =
country--which I haven't done in awhile :-( ??As far as the no extremist th=
ing; I did notice that you changed your little catch phrase--actually, I li=
ked the no extremist a little better... probably b/c it seems like there ar=
e a lot of people out there that ARE extremists (which in my book probably =
contributes to their singledom).... I had one guy offer to help me throw my=
 "evil time-wasting machine" out the window--referring to my tv, of course.=
 Given that one of my future home projects is to refinish the basement so t=
hat the future big screen tv will have a nice home, I figured we wouldn't r=

hings, although not nearly as much as I'd like. Actually, I'm most disappoi=
nted in the little time I spent on the golf course this year.... ??As for s=
kiing: Chari 10 b/c I love bumps. I blew my knee at Keystone and right now =
have NO plans to return there--ever, I hope, but that's probably unrealisti=
c. I just got the final ok from the orthopedist last Friday to head up to t=
he mtns and I was dying to go, but had plans on Sat and had to leave on Sun=
... Hoping to be up there this weekend. Hope everyone left me at least a li=
ttle snow! ??Oh, and finally: the "tell you later" thing is just b/c I don'=
t have any pets--unless you include the teddy bear that travels with me eve=
ry week, or the metal sculpture dog that sits on my deck, looking longingly=
 at the unused doggie door leading to my fenced yard... Someday there'll be=
 a "real" dog out there.... ??Ok, while I haven't grown tired of your quest=
ions, it is now 12:45am EST and I started with meetings at 7:00 this mornin=
g, so I'm going to call it quits for the night. ??Hope I have responded suf=
