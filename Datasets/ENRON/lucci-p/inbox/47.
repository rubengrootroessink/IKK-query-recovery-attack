Final Vail Trip Dates (One More Time)

The dates I sent the first time were wrong. 

I'm running the Motorola Marathon on Feb 17th in Austin and  Paul will be out of town from Feb 21 - 24th.  Therefore, here are the final dates:

26 Feb - Leave Dallas around 6:00 p.m. 
26 Feb - Pick up the OKC boys
26 Feb - Drive, Drive, Drive
27 Feb - Rest, Rent Gear, Party
28 Feb - Ski
29 Feb - Ski
1 Mar - Ski
2 Mar - Drive back to OKC / Dallas
3 Mar - Take Day off and rest

The Brazilian ski team will be in town unto the end of the month, so we have plenty of time. 

Later
