Hello Paul,

Thanks for your message.  I am just trying to catch up from the holidays.  I was in Steamboat Springs visiting my Aunt and Uncle's ranch with my cousins.  It was a big crew, and fun!  We were snowmobiling and sledding, but didn't get a chance to go skiing.  Hope your holidays were fun.

Anette

The following is my profile text: 
Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
