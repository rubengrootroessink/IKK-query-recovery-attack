Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to write.  Sorry I haven't gotten back to this sooner or the few other messages you sent.  I read your profile and you really seem like a great person.  My concern is that I have a cat... that I adore.  Her name is Missy and she was my Mom's. I have been taking care of her since my mom was in a fatal car accident two years ago and love this cat to pieces.   Sorry... I don't know if you are allergic or like some folks who just simply  don' t like cats... but she is part of my world and rock's it.  

If you don't mind my saying so... you should get a close up of your eyes... they are "beautiful!"  I know my picture is kinda blurry and I have no room to talk about picture quality... but you need to get up close up of those babies, "WOW!"  I don't mean to sound too flirtatious,  I just wanted to extend you a compliment where it is due.  What is the background behind you in the picture????

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  "Be Safe!"  
~ : )

>Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
