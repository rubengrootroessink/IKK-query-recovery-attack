The following is my profile text:

I would describe myself as extremely comfortable with who I am, mostly because I have an unsually close family. Most people can't believe how non-dysfunctional we are. I guess that is why I have managed to stay single so long. I am not in a hurry to rush into something just because it's the thing to do. I like sports both spectator and participation. Av's. Broncos, Pioneers etc. I really could do without the Nuggets and Rockies, even though I was mesmerized by the World Series this year. I like to bike, ski, golf etc. I read a lot, but it goes in spurts. I'll read three books in a week and then wait 3 weeks to pick up another book. I love to cook. I would like someone who can go out and mix in a lot of different situations, or hang out at home, and do absolutely nothing.
