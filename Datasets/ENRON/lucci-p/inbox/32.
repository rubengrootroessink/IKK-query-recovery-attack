Hi Paul-- 

Thanks very much for your email!  I would have to say that I'm not an extremist in any sense of the word, so you're pretty safe there... My only potential concern is that I've been described (not infrequently) as being sarcastic and I'm afraid it's a trait that won't change all that easily. If it's not going to be a deal-breaker for you, I'd love to chat. 

Thanks and happy Wednesday!

I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for so! meone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
