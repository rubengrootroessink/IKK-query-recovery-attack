Hi paul, thanks for the e-mail.  I enjoyed your profile, and was interested 
in what you like to do for fun.  Do you ski or snowboard?  What outdoor 
activities do you enjoy?  A little more about myself:  I am from south 
carolina, and I moved here about 16 months ago.  I am a physical therapist, 
and I work in lakewoood.  I have a wonderful husky named cherokee who joins 
me when I go backpacking, or hiking.  Hope that's enough for now.  Hope to 
hear from you.  Julie.
