Latest NFL Player News

Freddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
San Diego Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he is optimistic Jones
will be able to play Sunday. He has been sidelined by an ankle injury.

Wade Richey, K SD - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Richey is likely to lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if
they sign Steve Christie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to
kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to
21-for-30 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your
roster.

Steve Christie, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Chargers are expected to sign Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a
physical, according to the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>. He would handle
the field-goal chores for the remainder of the season, with Wade Richey
shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey owner and need a kicker, Christie
might be worth a pickup based on past history, but don't expect him to be
one of the better kickers in the league even if he does get the starting
job.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third
straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his
quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably
a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for
Sunday's game against Miami. He will practice this week before a final
decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split
carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for
Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in
his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game
against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin
Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from
a rib injury.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/27/01
Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to
determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and
Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision
on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is
9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the
practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for
Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter
based on his struggles.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to
No. 2 quarterback, according to <I>The Cincinnati Enquirer</I>. "If that's
what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me," Smith
said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not
a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now
likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on
Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be
surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him
if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

Moe Williams, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason
Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running
back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to
post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his
small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the
rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back,
and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However,
<i>The New York Newsday</i> reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's
game. 

Jake Arians, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to
replace him. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his
left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news
from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke with
him Saturday and he told me it went very well," Mora said. James, the
two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled
awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on
injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven
months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason
minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be
ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a
hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps
the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill
Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot
would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes
by, it gets a little bit closer." 

Shayne Graham, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake
Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami
Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start
of the season. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on
Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter
Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a
deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17
loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over
Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>.
"I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's
hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo,
so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his
sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a
protective boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time
this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners
face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington.
He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at
this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh
injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains
unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely
find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on
his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve
or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green
Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time
posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the
lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Batch is expected to start
Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "This is Charlie's
offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a little bit
today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect
him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB
Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still
uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is
dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week. 

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the
Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New
Orleans. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as
Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "There've been quarterbacks who
have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"
coach George Seifert told the <I>Charlotte Observer</I>. "Even though there
are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been
disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial
than not." While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke
isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring
injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland.
However, he is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. "I'll be
there," Sanders told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "They're just real sore
from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear." In any
event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough
Oakland secondary. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but
he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progress,"
coach Dave McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "We're going to come
to a point where we're going to have to make a decision." Moore, who has
missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured
reserve list this week. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman
to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a
broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/26/01
Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half of
Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not throw a
touchdown pass for the first time this season, however, and has been very
inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to
struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/26/01
It is unclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against
Chicago, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited
him on Thursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time
when Batch can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to
the tough Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01
The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their
starting quarterback for next Sunday's game against Washington. Carter
started the first game of the season for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38
yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't recommend him in any league
this season.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/26/01
Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pulled right
hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an eye on his
progress during practice this week before you make a final decision on him.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/26/01
Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring
problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against
San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him
for Week 12.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/26/01
Graham suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current
status is day to day.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01
Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will
elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi
Ayanbadejo as a backup.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/26/01
Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has
not been determined yet.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/26/01
Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day
to day.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/26/01
Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers.
He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of
Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/26/01
Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at
halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott
Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the
Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has
certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a
solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on
Jimmy Smith.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk
because of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet
statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy
team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a
fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter
on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend
on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five
passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would
still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against
Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including
13 receptions, in San Diego?s 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against
Arizona. However, he?s only worth starting when the matchup is to his
advantage. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown
against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve
Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and
a touchdown against San Diego. He?s one of the most reliable Fantasy
receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78
yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver,
but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against
New England. He?s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is
worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for
17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and
Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the
near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many
carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New
Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option
for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing
and four touchdowns. He?s become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his
performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots? bench for
another week.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the
Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the
most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a
hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to
the game.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196
yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners
should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the
year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a
mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one
interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long
as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD
pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for
most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His
performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still
too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no
TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from
such a quiet performance.

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too
inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs
approach. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has
slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk
during the Fantasy homestretch. 

Ki-Jana Carter, RB WAS - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back
problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if
Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor
injuries.

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted
decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69
yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His
status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.
He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy
disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against
Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game,
which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.
He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy
disappointment if he stays healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Christian had a surprisingly strong game on Sunday, posting 122 yards of
total offense and a touchdown against Carolina. He may be worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues, but don't expect these type of numbers from
Christian on a weekly basis. 

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Rhodes had a solid game against San Francisco, posting 147 scrimmage yards
and a touchdown. Look for Rhodes to be a dependable Fantasy player for the
remainder of the year. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Holmes rushed for 120 yards and caught three passes for 70 yards against
the Seaahwks, but both of Kansas City's TDs were scored by other RBs. You
can depend on Holmes for fine yardage totals down the stretch, but he will
continue to lose carries to Tony Richardson and other backs in the red
zone.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Manning had 374 yards passing and a touchdown against San Francisco, but he
also threw four interceptions. The Colts' quarterback is definitely having
a down year, but it's still tough to bench a guy with as much potential as
Manning. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Robinson caught three passes for only 29 yards at Kansas City. A week after
catching his first pro TD, Robinson has reverted back to being a mediocre
Fantasy player.

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Owens came up huge for San Francisco once again, catching six passes for
103 yards and a touchdown against Indianapolis. He may very well be the
best receiver in Fantasy Football at this point. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on
Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his
worth as a Fantasy player. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Mason compiled seven catches for 114 yards against Pittsburgh on Sunday.
He's been a pretty reliable Fantasy player in recent weeks, especially now
that the Titans are throwing the ball more on offense. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
The Chiefs held Alexander to 43 rushing yards, but he did manage to catch
six passes for 62 yards and a TD. Even if opponents manage to stop him on
the ground, Alexander can still be a threat as a receiver on flat and short
passes.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
McNair put up 334 yards passing and three touchdowns (two passng, one
rushing) on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He's been surprisingly solid in
recent weeks, especially when Tennessee is behind late in the game. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Burress had a great game against Tennessee, posting eight catches for 114
yards and a touchdown. He may not be a highly dependable Fantasy player,
but he's worth starting when the matchup is right. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Stewart had another big game, posting 254 yards passing and two touchdowns
against Tennessee. "Slash" also had 54 yards rushing and a touchdown, and
seems to have established himself as a decent option for Fantasy owners in
recent weeks. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/25/01
Johnson had a huge game on Sunday, catching six passes for 113 yards and a
touchdown against Cincinnati. He has been Cleveland's most reliable
receiver this year, and has become a pretty dependable Fantasy player. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
Jackson started Sunday's game against Cincinnati, but complied only 40
yards rushing. Coach Butch Davis also used Benjamin Gay and Jamel White,
which seriously effected Jackson's Fantasy numbers. 

Freddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Jones has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Arizona. He has
been dealing with an ankle injury in recent weeks that still needs time to
heal sufficiently. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/25/01
Cleeland has been declared inactive for Sunday's game at New England due to
an ankle injury. Look for Boo Williams to start in Cleeland's absence once
again. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/25/01
Glenn has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He
has been dealing with a hamstring injury in recent weeks, and could be in
jeopardy of missing the remainder of the season. He may be placed on
injured reserve if he doesn't practice this week.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
Kitna was benched in the third quarter of Sunday's game against Cleveland.
Kitna (8-of-19, 85 yards, two interceptions), was replaced by backup Scott
Mitchell, who promptly threw three interceptions of his own. 

Steve Smith, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the third quarter with an
apparent shoulder injury. However, he returned to action later in the
quarter. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Warrick left Sunday's game against Cleveland in the first half with a
shoulder injury. He was taken to the locker room for X-rays, and did not
return to the game. Warrick finished the game with only one catch for 22
yards. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Carolina in the first half with an
apparent ankle injury. He was replaced by Rodney Thomas for a few series
before returning to the contest late in the second quarter. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Davis left Sunday's game in the first quarter with soreness in his back. He
was replaced by Ki-Jana Carter and returned in the second quarter after
going to the locker room for an examination.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Wycheck (calf) is expected to start against the Steelers. He has been
cleared to play.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Scott (ribs) will play against the Browns on Sunday after a problem-free
pregame workout. He did not practice during the week.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
According to published reports, Alexander will play on Sunday, but will not
start. Walter Rasby is expected to be Washington's No. 1 tight end.
