The following is my profile text:

I'm an attractive, energetic professional looking for someone in Denver. I enjoy snow shoeing, tennis, hiking and lots of other outdoor activities. I am well traveled and enjoy exploring new places. I love the outdoors and am looking for an adventerous soul to explore with.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your
