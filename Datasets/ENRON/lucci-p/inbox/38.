Hiya-- 

I don't know who's telling to you tales, but I grew up in a household where my mother's nagging reigned supreme--to the point that it seems like I only respond to nagging!! And as for excuses: damn straight! I love excuses!  

With regard to your header: I'm glad to hear that you're thin,ing of changing it b/c I started to run through the permutations of where you might have been going with that, ie: hung like a horse, etc... not exactly what I think you're trying to convey. Then again, maybe you were... 

Ok, away from that subject... I should have realized that there was a good chance that you work for Enron; what a nightmare! ugh.  Of course, I think there's a good chance they'll hang out in bankruptcy for awhile so hopefully the workforce impact won't be terrible. Although I'm surprised to hear that they're looking at trying to spin your your group off so quickly; those things usually have to get approved by the bankruptcy court and take awhile to go through. In any case, I would like to hear how that progresses... I can't wait to hear the lawsuits against AA. 

Ok, I promised myself I'd aim for > 5 hours of sleep at least one night this week and tonight is it; if I don't end  this I'm going to miss that window, so I'll just say good night.
