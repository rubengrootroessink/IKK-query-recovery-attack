Hello Again,

Thanks for the email.  I'll try and tell you more about myself.  My name is Paul I currently live in Broomfield but I'm thinking very seriously about selling my place and moving out into the area around Golden.  Maybe Look Mountain or Genesee, Broomfield is ok when you're married, which I was for 4 years now divorced two, but a little far from everything when your single.  Athletic but only competitive when provoked.  How am I doing so far?

Let's see I moved to Colorado from Texas (San Antonio) in 1992, and I don't think I'm ever going back, although I work as a Natural Gas trader for a company that's based in Houston.  No pets or kids due to the fact that I travel somewhat frequently for my job and pleasure.  Well at least the travel and pets part, the kids part is for other reasons which I'm sure you can imagine.  I like to ski but prefer the summer better.  And finally, if I get this job I'll work hard to insure this company remains profitable and loyal to it's customers.  Oh sorry I got off on a tangent.

I've been doing this internet dating thing for a couple of weeks and so far it's been a lot of fun.  I think as long as you take it for what it is; in my case, a way to flirt with pretty girls during down times at work, you can have fun with it.  So far, I've only met one girl in person after meeting her on this service.  We wrote emails back and forth and one night coincidentally ran into each other at a bar. (Little Bear in Evergreen) She actually was very nice but had these hands that were giant, they looked like men's hands and everytime she would touch me I would freak out.  I think she worked in a meat packing plant.  Anyway we hung out for awhile but have not seen each other since.  Thank God because the therapy I would have to go through to get those hands out of my mind would have cost a fortune.  I do have another bad date story but I'll save that one for later.

Now as to what caught my attention, it was your picture!  What are those, Rams?
So now it's your turn, what's your story.  Include all your darkest secrets complete with all your "bad date" stories.

Paul
