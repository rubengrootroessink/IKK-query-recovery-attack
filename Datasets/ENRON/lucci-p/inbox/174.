Northern Gas Company is requesting a letter proposal for peaking gas for
December 2001 through February 2002.  This proposal could be for the Casper
Pooling point #18106 or any other mutually agreeable points into NGC's
system.  The volumes should be a max volume of 15,000 to 20,000/d.  NGC
would like to receive this proposal by November 7th and we will notify
suppliers on November 9th or 12th.  If you have questions let me know.
Thanks, Lorraine
