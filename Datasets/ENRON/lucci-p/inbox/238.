Thanks for the email.  It was my first one!  I just got everything set up on this service and now I'm curious.  I liked what I read in your profile, but I'm wondering why you didn't include a picture?  I think you have me at a disadvantage.  I'll keep this short incase I'm doing something wrong and this email comes back to me.  Drop me a line and we'll chat.

Paul

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by 
clicking 'Contact this person' and composing your message directly from the 
site.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your 
message as we are unable to remove these.

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.
