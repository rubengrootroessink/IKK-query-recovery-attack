hiya-- 

Sorry I never sent back the  longer email I said I would... I don't seem to get a lot done these days without a fair amount of nagging, etc. Did you only ski on Friday? Why are you skiing on Thurs this week when you have to turn around and go back to work on Friday? As for Keystone: yuck. I have to say that I would be happy if I never skied at that place again. (I generally don't like the mtn, PLUS it was the scene of the crime re: my knee injury...)  I did make it up last weekend: skied Vail on Sat and it was GREAT. The snow conditions were amazing and certainly the weather was just beautiful. A friend from business school needs to burn a few vacation days so he flew to Denver last night and is skiing today and tomorrow with some random friends from Ft. Collins, then I told him I'd take Friday off and ski with him Fri and Sat. Hopefully it'll be Copper on Fri and Vail on Sat. 

As for the next step... I'm sort of a fan of meeting sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, this weekend is looking a little messy (and yes, I'm in Philly right now, will return tomorrow night, then out again on Sun...)  Maybe we can try talking  in the interim?  My cell # is 720-244-5976 and I'm usually around in the evenings... 

:-) 

Steph 

ps--how were the new skis??  Funny, my new parabolics (ok, really they were new 2 seasons ago, but I didn't ski last year, so they're still new to me... :-)  are 187's. At this rate, I'm afraid I'd actually notice the 3cm difference! :-)

Hey,

How have you been? Are you on the road again? As I said I went skiing last week and the conditions were actually very good. We skied Keystone and although they didn't have the majority of the runs open, the ones that were open were nice. I think I may ski again either tomorrow or this weekend. 
What about you have you skied yet.

So what's the next move with us, are we ever going to talk in person? I'm not sure how you advance in the internet dating scene, any ideas? 

Paul
