Hello,

I was surfing through the pictures on this web site and ran across yours.  I found you to be attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along mine so you can take a look and see if there is any interest.  I hope there is and that I hear from you later.

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
