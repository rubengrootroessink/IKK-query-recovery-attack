Hello Again,

I do ski and sometimes even snowboard.  I haven't been up very much this year but I think things are about to change.  What about you, are you an extreme skier?

I'll be going to San Antonio (TX) for the holidays.  My folks have a small ranch outside Kerrville in what they call the "Hill Country."  It's actually pretty nice.  I hope the weather is good.  South Texas isn't all that bad in the winter....it's the summer that's hell!  What do you have planned for the holidays?  Where are you from?

I'm taking off for the airport.  Drop me a line and tell me how you're doing.  Have a GREAT holiday and let's talk soon.

Paul
