The following is my profile text:

Some people would describe me as "having a lot of energy," friendly, outgoi=
ng, intuitive and kind. I am physically fit, but not perfect. I enjoy worki=
ng out by going to the gym, hiking, mountain biking and snowshoeing. I am i=
n the Consulting sales and management area. For fun I love to hang out with=
 my friends and family, go on spontaneous adventurous trips, go to parties,=
 read, hike and attend sporting events. The types of music that move me are=
 songs that actually have something to say about life and romantic, classic=
al music. I am the happiest when I'm healthy and everything is going great.=
 I am happy when I'm with my family and friends and the person that I am wi=
th. I am the most at peace when I am away from noise and surrounded by beau=
ty. What I have done that makes me the proudest of myself is achieving thin=
gs that I thought I never could. If I could invite any 5 people to dinner i=
t would be my parents, my best friend, the person that I'm in love with and=
 my favorite cousin. My idea of a perfect date is having a nice dinner and =
staying up all night talking. I am looking for someone who is easy to talk =
to, non-judgemental, and who enjoys life to the fullest. I am not the type =
of person who likes to meet people in a bar setting. I am looking for someo=
ne who makes me laugh and appreciates who I am.=20
