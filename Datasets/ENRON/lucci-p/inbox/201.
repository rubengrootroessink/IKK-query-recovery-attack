The following is my profile text:

Hi! My friend's have described me as cute, intelligent, fun loving, outgoing, happy, easily amused, intuitive etc...etc...!  I love to read, hike, ski, hang out w/good friend's eating good food & drinking good wine!  I love to laugh & I love being around people who make me laugh.  I love the outdoors & I love the ocean.  My favorite things are weekend getaways, moonlite walks, good conversation, & having time to spend at the Tattered Cover (I often loose track of time there).  I love most kinds of music except for heavy metal...which I don't consider to be music!  One of my dreams is to have a house on the beach & one nestled in the mountains.  My mountain house is going to be the location of some wonderful, cozy, holiday parties!  I am into health & staying healthy, I work out & try to stay in shape!  The Boulder Boulder is my favorite annual event, (but please don't ask me my time!!) it's more for fun & fame (ha ha!!)
