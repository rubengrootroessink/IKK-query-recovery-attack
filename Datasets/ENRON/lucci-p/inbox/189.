Paul,
 
Attached is a schedule showing what our worksheet amounts came to for the CIG and the PSCo invoicing.  To the right of that you'll see the date we (Nicole or Theresa and Mark or myself depending on which month) agreed on the amount and sent the wire transfer request to our A/P and the date the wire paid.  
 
Some months I sent the Colorado payments to A/P the same day as the Arizona payments and A/P put them together since they were to the same vendor.  Hope this helps.
 
I still maintain that this complete payment review is a separate issue from the LGS/Woodward volumes which you can clearly see that we didn't deduct (the CIG volumes are exactly what we paid) while for the same months you were billing LGS/Woodward for those volumes as well.  Please do everything you can to expedite resolution of this matter and we look forward to working with you on your payment review.
 
Sincerely,



-Craig W. Lipke

Can you please get with John Cogan on our need for all wire transfer backup.  We will need the detail of all wire transfers sent to ENA for payment on the CIG and PSCo assets.  You can reach me at 303 575-6474.
