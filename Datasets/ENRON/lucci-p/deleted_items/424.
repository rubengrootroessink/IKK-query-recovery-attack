INSIDER'S TIP

Avoid the four o'clock traffic congestion in Breckenridge by
sticking around for a while. Relax and have a cup of coffee or
a bite to eat before leaving town so you can miss the end of
the day rush.  You can take the Main Street Express Shuttle
from the parking lots for your free ride to historic Main Street.
The Main Street Express runs Thursday-Sunday from
approximately 2:30-7:30pm and picks up every 7.5 minutes
to take guests to and from the downtown area.
