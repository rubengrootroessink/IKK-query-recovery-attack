        <b>ALL-NEW iTax&#153; Has Everything You Need to File Your Taxes!  And it's FREE!</b><br><br>
        As a Go Daddy Software customer, you are aware of our philosophy to provide high-quality products at affordable prices.  Bob Parsons, our founder, had the same philosophy when he owned Parsons Technology, where he pioneered low-cost, high-quality tax software.<br><br>
        On or before January 15th Go Daddy will launch an all-new product, iTax.  iTax is incredible new online tax preparation software that functions faster and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/itax_tell.asp?isc=gdtaxps&display=chart">better than the other online tax products</a>.  iTax is built with state-of-the-art Microsoft .NET technology to provide a fast, efficient and feature-rich way to complete your 2001 income tax return.<br><br>
        Just look at what you get with iTax (and you get it for FREE!):
        <ul>
        <li><b>It's fast</b> ? An easy-to-use expert interview will guide you seamlessly through the process of completing your tax return in just minutes!</li>
        <li><b>It's easy</b> ? There's no filtering through reams of IRS instructions, no calculators and no headaches.  It's all on line!</li>
        <li><b>It's complete</b> ? You get everything you need.  All the important forms and schedules.  Nothing is held back.  No tricks.  No gimmicks.  It's chock full of deluxe features (like context sensitive help from J.K. Lasser & the IRS, and even tools to help you avoid an audit!).</li>
        <li><b>It's direct</b>  ? Print your return for free or eFile your tax return & speed up your refund (even arrange to pay your taxes at the last possible moment) for only $7.95. Match that deal anywhere!</li>
        <li><b>It's secure</b> ? Your tax return will be protected using a VeriSign Secure Certificate, a double dose of encryption and password protection.</li>
        <li><b>It's 100% guaranteed</b> ? If there is an error in your return as a result of a computational error in iTax, Go Daddy will pay the penalty.</li>
        <li><b>And, of course, it's FREE!</b></li>
        </ul>
        Why are we doing this?  What's the catch?  As you know Go Daddy Software is not a non-profit organization.  So how do we make money?  It's simple.  We're banking on the fact that many customers will eFile their tax return and the small margin we make on the processing charge will carry the day.  And because it's a smokin' deal you will tell your friends, and come back year after year.<br><br>
