 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - October 10, 2001 - PGS Energy Training
announced today the official release of its innovative new training product
Seminars-on-Demand (version 2.1) for the energy and electric power
industries.

Seminars-on-Demand is a completely new way to train employees in the
critical subject areas of energy derivatives, electricity trading, and
proper
deal structuring techniques. It eliminates the time and distance constraints
that frequently preclude live classroom training and enables employees to
increase their value in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.

"In today's marketplace, a well-trained staff is a firm's most powerful
strategic weapon. This new product finally allows a company to deliver
training across the entire organization in a cost-effective and timely
manner", said PGS Energy Training CEO John Adamiak.

Seminars-on-Demand works by combining an innovative CD-ROM
seminar presentation with a matching instructional manual and phone-based
instructor/student interaction.  Two-week, annual and unlimited corporate
enterprise licenses are available.

Free Preview CDs are available by calling 412-279-9298, visiting
www.seminars-on-demand.com, or by visiting the PGS Energy Training
booth at PowerMart in Houston next week.

Established in 1990, PGS Energy Training delivers in-depth training programs
in energy derivatives, electricity trading and gas-to-electricity arbitrage.
In addition to its new Seminars-on-Demand CD-ROM based training, PGS
Energy Training offers on-site classroom programs, open registration public
seminars and confidential training for senior executives.
