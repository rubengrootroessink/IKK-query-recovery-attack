Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Andy Neely, San Diego, CA 

I've got so much talent at RB I'm not sure who to start this weekend. Marshall Faulk is a no-brainer, but that leaves me to choose among Eddie George, Mike Anderson and Garrison Hearst. Eddie would be my first choice, but he is nursing an injury and going up against a good Tampa Bay defense. 

Answer - GG 

You're right to have doubts about George this week. Hearst has looked good in his last two games, but he's not finding the end zone and continues to split carries with Kevan Barlow. That leaves Anderson, who has the best chance at posting solid Fantasy numbers against a Seattle defense that has been very inconsistent through the first four weeks of the season. 


Question - Robert Smith, Philadelphia, PA 

I have Frank Wycheck. He has not produced the way I thought he would this year, and his health is uncertain. Should I pick up Erron Kinney or Dwayne Carswell and drop Wycheck? 

Answer - GG 

Wycheck is dealing with a strained neck, but he's expected to start this weekend against Tampa Bay. Erron Kinney is emerging as a solid pass-catching tight end, but Wycheck is still one of Tennessee's most reliable receiving threats and is far too valuable to simply drop. He's averaged nearly 70 receptions over the past three years and is still a top-tier Fantasy player. 


Question - Joe Serodio, Boston, MA 

I had Jamal Anderson as my No. 1 back, but ever since his injury I've had to use Jerome Bettis and Thomas Jones as my starters. I was offered Mike Alstott and Priest Holmes for Bill Schroeder. What should I do? 

Answer - GG 

Depending on the depth of your receivers, we'd suggest making this deal if it's the best trade you can negotiate. Alstott will be Tampa Bay's featured back for at least another week, and Holmes seems to have secured the No. 1 spot in Kansas City with Tony Richardson's recent injury. Schroeder has been a great Fantasy player thus far, but it'll be tough for him to keep up his current pace. While it may be tough to let him go, dealing Schroeder for Alstott and Holmes is the best move you can make to ease the loss of Anderson.

Tip of the Week 

Dave Slater, Pittsburgh, PA: Hines Ward is one of the most underrated receivers in the league. He already has 24 receptions this season, and it's just a matter of time before those receptions turn into touchdowns. Pittsburgh's offense may not be the best, but Ward is the best receiving threat on their roster and will develop into a reliable Fantasy player.
