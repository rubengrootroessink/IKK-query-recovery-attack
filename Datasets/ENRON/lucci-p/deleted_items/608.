; &gt; &gt;Subject: Women Only Hotel<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;A g=
roup of girlfriends went on vacation and they saw a<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;five-s=
tory hotel with a sign that read &quot;For Women Only.&quot; Since<BR>&gt; =
&gt; &gt;they were without their boyfriends, they decided to go in.<BR>&gt;=
 &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The doorman, a very attractive guy, explains to=
 them how it works...<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;We have 5 floors...go up floor=
 by floor, and once you<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; find what you are looking for, yo=
u can stay there. It's easy to<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;decide, since each floor ha=
s signs telling you what's inside.&quot;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt=
;So they start going up, and on the first floor the sign<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;r=
eads &quot;All the men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive<BR>=
&gt; &gt; &gt;and kind&quot; ...<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The fri=
ends laugh and without hesitation move on to the<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;next floo=
r.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The sign on the Second floor reads &q=
uot;All the men here are<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;wonderful lovers, but they genera=
lly treat women badly. This<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;wasn't going to do.<BR>&gt; &g=
t; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;So the friends move up to the Third floor where th=
e sign<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;read &quot;All the men here are great lovers and se=
nsitive to the needs of<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;women.&quot;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>=
&gt; &gt; &gt;This was good but there were still two more floors, so<BR>&gt=
; &gt; &gt;they moved on to the fourth floor, where the sign read:<BR>&gt; =
&gt; &gt;&quot;All the men here have perfect builds; are sensitive and atte=
ntive to<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;women; are perfect lovers; they are also single, =
rich and straight&quot;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The women were v=
ery pleased but still they decided that<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;they would rather =
see what the fifth floor had to offer before they<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;settled =
for the fourth.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;When they reached the Fi=
fth floor, there was only a sign that read:<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; =
&gt;&quot;There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that th=
ere<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;is no way to please a woman.&quot;</FONT></P>
