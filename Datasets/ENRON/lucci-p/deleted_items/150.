No because Huggins is rolling his defense and that is an additional 12 points.  So your man Joe has to score 9.  Don't make me work the math.

I did win. 70-67.  I'm proving to the world that I don't even need a quarterback or a defense to win, I only need like three players.  No, the real story is the NFL played a nThursday night game without asking me if I had my lineup set first.  The nerve . . .
