Sorry to interrupt you last night, I went to the Little Bear for awhile, 
Opie Gone Bad was playing.  Managed to get a little free time and thought 
you might want to come up if you weren't busy.  I should have known.  I'll 
be working at the club this morning and then working out.  Going to attempt 
to join Alicia and Mark at that party tonight.  Wish me luck!  Hope you have 
a great time tonight.  Don't allow anyone else to give you goosebumps just 
yet...I haven't gotten my fill!  I want to call you, just to hear your sexy 
voice!
