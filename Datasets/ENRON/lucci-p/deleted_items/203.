This is the beginning of the busy season for my industry, so things have been hoppin at work.  Celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend.  Very fun!  Been wanting to get some golfing in before it gets too cold.  What about you?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.
