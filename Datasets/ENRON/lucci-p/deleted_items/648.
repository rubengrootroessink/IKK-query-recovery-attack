Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. "I feel pretty good," Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. "It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not."
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable.

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
