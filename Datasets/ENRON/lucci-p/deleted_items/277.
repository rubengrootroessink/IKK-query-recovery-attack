Latest NFL Player News

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, an MRI on Faulk's right knee revelead a
bone bruise, and no cartilage or ligament damage. He is expected to miss at
least one game before being re-evaluated.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125
yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at
this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three
scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the
performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both
catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line
threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73
yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry
Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine
numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is
still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this
week.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The
second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore
passing game.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes
for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly
basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your
receivers. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The young, strong
back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears
on.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117
yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a
pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored
on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game,
even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New
England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is
becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did
score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and
is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It
appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy
player.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and
two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite
the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve
spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards
on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib
problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he
did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in
the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a
touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week,
but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against
Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still
warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total
offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of
relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after
offseason toe surgery. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Huntley rushed for only two yards on four carries against New Orleans. The
Panthers are still searching for a quality runner, but Huntley doesn't
appear capable of filling their void at RB.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Muhammad caught only two passes for eight yards against he Saints. Don't
expect such poor numbers from Muhammad very often. He remains a quality
Fantasy wideout.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Green was solid on Sunday, catching six passes for 72 yards and a score
against Tennessee. Despite his good performance, Green is still not a
reliable player from a Fantasy perspective. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140
yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and
deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage
numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue
to be a consistent TD threat.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against
Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa
Bay's 31-28 overtime win. 

Tai Streets, WR SF - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Streets caught four passes for 51 yards against Atlanta. With J.J. Stokes
continuing to wallow in mediocrity, Streets has a chance to step up and
take a more prominent role in the San Francisco offense.

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Johnson finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards
and three scores against Tennessee. He is still not worth starting on a
regular basis, however, and is better off used when the matchup is good. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Robinson struggled on Sunday, catching only two passes for six yards. He
had been dealing with a sore lower back, which may have had something to do
with his performance in the game. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas
is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth
stashing away on your roster if available. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime.
Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best
receivers.

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown.
However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against
a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the
Bears' tailback on a weekly basis. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Surprisingly, Miller had a tough day against a shaky Arizona defense on
Sunday. The Bears' QB threw for only 116 yards and was picked off twice in
Chicago's 21-13 victory. Miller is still worth a roster spot, but he's no
better than a backup Fantasy-wise.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against
the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a
waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Minnis caught one pass for only 14 yards against the Steelers. The rookie
has been inconsistent so far, and is a risky start unless he faces a
below-average defense.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held
to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements
have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jurevicius posted a solid game against St. Louis, catching six passes for
101 yards. If he continues to put up good numbers, Jurevicius could keep
Ike Hilliard from getting back his starting role. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Holmes rushed for 150 yards and two TDs against Pittsburgh. Such good
numbers against the Steelers prove Holmes has arrived as a quality Fantasy
player.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed
for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying
his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Collins completed 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday
against St. Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise
despite his decent numbers against the Rams. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38
yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only
reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter
after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action
after being sidelined for only one play. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Grbac suffered a sprained neck in the first half of Sunday's game at Green
Bay, but stayed in the game until the fourth quarter. He was finally
replaced by Randall Cunningham when Green Bay took a 31-10 lead.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Faulk left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the second half with a
sprained MCL in his right knee. Trung Canidate replaced Faulk, who did not
return to the game. Faulk is expected to miss up to four weeks due to the
injury, so it might be a good idea for Fantasy owners to pick up Trung
Canidate immediately. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Schroeder suffered an ankle injury just before halftime of Sunday's game.
He did not return for the second half, although he was available and ready
to play if needed.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair left Sunday's game against Tampa Bay in the second quarter due to a
twisted ankle. However, he did return to the game at the start of the
second half. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jeffers was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. He is
getting close to playing form, though, and might return to action in the
near future.

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Goings was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. Tim
Biakabutuka and Richard Huntley are getting carries at halfback.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn is getting the majority of the work in Tampa Bay's backfield against
Tennessee. He had been nursing a foot injury, but seems to be close to 100
percent. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Pittman left Sunday's game against Chicago in the first quarter due to an
undisclosed leg injury. However, Pittman did return to the game in the
second quarter. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne (neck) played in the first series of Sunday's game against St. Louis.
He'll likely be the Giants' featured back for most of the game. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Heap is out for Sunday's against Green Bay. Look for Shannon Sharpe to have
a productive game in his absence. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Mason (ankle and shoulder) has been declared inactive for Week Six. Justin
McCareins or Chris Sanders should start in his place.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Barber (hamstring) is out for Sunday's game against St. Louis. Ron Dayne is
expected to start in his absence. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, the newly-signed Leaf might be given a
chance to win Dallas' starting QB job. There is growing speculation that
Quincy Carter might share starts or playing time with Leaf when he returns
from a hamstring injury. Carter is expected to miss as much as eight weeks.

J.J. Johnson, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, Johnson did not travel with the team to
face the Jets today. Travis Minor will be Miami's third-down back in Week
Six.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George (ankle) felt better on Friday and is expected to start on Sunday
against Tampa Bay. He doesn't think that the injury will limit his
movement, and shouldn't keep him from being effective. Unless you have a
solid stable of running backs, it seems as though starting George is a safe
bet. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis
with a wrist injury, but he is expected to play. However, Charlie Garner
will get the majority of the carries if Wheatley is not ready to play
against the Colts.

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Ismail (knee) had another solid practice on Saturday and is expected to
start on Monday against Washington. He may be worth considering in larger
leagues, but the lack of a consistent passing game in Dallas makes "the
Rocket" a gamble Fantasy-wise. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/14/01
Jenkins will be used as Arizona's No. 3 receiver on Sunday against Chicago.
However, don't be fooled by his solid performance last week against
Philadelphia. Unless Jenkins shows that he can be more productive on a
consistent basis, there's no need to pick him up Fantasy-wise. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Mathis (hip) is expected to start on Sunday against San Francisco. He's
worth starting Fantasy-wise unless you play in a smaller league and have
the option of using a better wideout. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles (knee) practiced on Friday and is now exepcted to start on Sunday
against Miami. He'll be going up against a tough Miami secondary, however,
so you may want to consider benching him outside of deeper leagues. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson (ribs) will start on Sunday against Cincinnati. He will wear a flak
jacket to protect his injured ribs, which should keep him from worsening
his condition. He's worth starting against a Cincinnati defense that can be
beaten on the ground. 

 Saints, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game
against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this
week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard is dealing with a strained oblique muscle, but he's still expected
to play on Sunday against St. Louis. He'll be the No. 3 receiver once
again, and isn't worth starting outside of deeper leagues. 

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Ron Dayne (neck) is expected to start Sunday's game against St. Louis, so
Washington won't get all of the playing time in New York's backfield. In
any event, we wouldn't advise starting any of the Giants' backs this week. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to miss Sunday's game against St. Louis. In
fact, his hamstring injury is lingering so badly that he may even miss the
Oct. 22 game against Philadelphia. Reserve him for this week at the very
least. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne participated in practice on Saturday and is expected to start on
Sunday against St. Louis. The Giants will likely fall behind early against
the Rams' juggernaut offense, however, which could mean a down game for
Dayne. If you can afford to reserve the big tailback, we'd definitely
consider it. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) practiced on Friday and is expected to start in Sunday's game
agaisnt Tennessee. Dunn says that he knows the foot will bother him, but
he'll play through the pain. "You have to play hurt in this league, that's
just the way it is," Dunn told the <I>Tampa Tribune</I>. "My foot's going
to hurt the rest of the year; I'll just have to play through it." Head
Coach Tony Dungy will use Dunn as the featured back in the game, not just
on third downs. With the current state of running backs what it is,
starting Dunn Fantasy-wise is advisable. 

 Lions, DT DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game
against Minnesota. This should mean big things for both Randy Moss and Cris
Carter, who will have an easy time beating Detroit's corners on a regular
basis. 

Bobby Collins, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Collins was released by the Green Bay Packers this week. He had minimal
Fantasy value to begin with, so the move has very little significance
Fantasy-wise. 

Kent Graham, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Graham has been elevated to the No. 2 spot on Washington's QB depth chart.
If Tony Banks continues to struggle, don't be surprised to see coach Marty
Schottenheimer elevate Graham's status to No. 1 in the coming weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, coach Marty Schottenheimer will
give Davis more carries on Monday against Dallas. Davis has struggled thus
far, but it's been less about him and more about the Redskins tendency to
fall behind the opposition early in games. If ever there was a week to
start Davis, this is it. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn will play in Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers after
missing four games due to a suspension. He won't start, but will instead be
used in three-receiver sets. Glenn is worth picking up if available
Fantasy-wise, but he's not worth starting just yet. 

Jake Moreland, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
The New York Jets signed Moreland off their practice squad this week. He'll
make virtually no impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Craig Yeast, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Yeast was signed by the New York Jets this week. He'll make little impact
Fantasy-wise, so don't consider him for your roster. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Richardson (shoulder) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. He'll likely miss at least another three weeks due to the
injury. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander (back spasms) is expected to be in the starting lineup for Kansas
City against Pittsburgh on Sunday. He took all of the snaps with the first
team offense on Friday with no real problems. This game could be a real
defensive battle, so you may want to consider reserving Alexander if your
roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Rob Konrad, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Konrad (ankle) will be back in the Dolphins' starting lineup on Sunday
against the Jets. Konrad has minimal value as a Fantasy player, so his
return has little significance Fantasy-wise. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Matthews has been released by the Chicago Bears, but he's expected to be
re-signed sometime next week. The Bears needed an emergency long snapper
due to an ankle injury suffered by starter Patrick Mannelly, so they signed
Ryan Benjamin as insurance. Matthews' was released to make room for
Benjamin. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, will start on Sunday
for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some
short-yardage packages. Chandler has looked good thus far, and is worth
starting in deeper leagues. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/13/01
After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing shoulder,
Griese was a full participant in Friday's workout and was expected to start
on Sunday in Seattle. The Broncos added Griese to their injury report
Friday morning, listing him as questionable. An hour later, however, Griese
had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute workout. Coach Mike Shanahan
said he was confident that, barring any setbacks, Griese will play against
the Seahawks. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Stewart to help your Fantasy team this week. The Steelers had
success running the ball last week, using a two-pronged attack, and will
stick to that strategy. Besides, Stewart won't be too effective when he
finally does throw the ball. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three
games this season. 

Troy Edwards, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Edwards will catch a few passes this week but he won't be productive enough
to help a Fantasy team. The Steelers will run the ball for most of the
game. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Amos might become famous soon enough if he continues to run like he did
last week. Look for him to continue to run well this week against the
Chiefs and score a touchdown. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Burress' struggles will continue again this week, but it won't be solely
because of his effort. The Steelers will implement a strict running game.
They were extremely successful running the ball last week. Also, Burress
won't get open enough to be productive.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Dunn tested his sprained right foot in practice Friday and could return to
Tampa Bay's lineup against the Tennessee Titans. His status for this week
was upgraded from questionable to probable Friday, though a decision on
whether he will play won't be made until Sunday. If he is cleared to play,
Dunn expects to assume his normal workload. But he is a risky Fantasy start
because of his uncertain condition. Dunn won't put up good numbers if he is
less than 100 percent.
