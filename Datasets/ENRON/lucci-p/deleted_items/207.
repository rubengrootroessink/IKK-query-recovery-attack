Latest NFL Player News

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at
Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep
him inactive until he is effective in a game. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a
football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is
dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps
and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game
on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's
secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills
to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend
might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an
injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE
Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency
quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on
the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run,
throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would
just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are
sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no
timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss
the next game because of an injured right knee. "Tyrone Wheatley has a
second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"'
coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for
the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the
injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be
out four weeks. "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play
in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more
serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke
had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert
said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would
start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident
he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness
after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was
aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks
defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his
shoulder. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained
ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is
in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green
would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas
City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised
if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to
play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to
start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's
game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he
may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head
Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday
against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good
choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on
Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues
from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in
the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable
to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was
filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his
swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in
Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become
Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but
his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a
right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis
Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a
right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week,
this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes
completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB
job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup
Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head
Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend
you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to
recommend you start any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too
productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars'
previous. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked
like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well
this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of
couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in
Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is
listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only
has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his
hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is
much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We
believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the
muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes
the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with
a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to
Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the <i>Buffalo News</i> he plans to have minor surgery on both
knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not
affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved
in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy
again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but
he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the
Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would
start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Miami Herald</i> says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he
had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will
return.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning Star</I>, Smith could end up splitting
more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo
believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move
will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which
revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action
due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is
expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against
Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 

Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on
his right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the
<I>Contra Costa Times</I>. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of
that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The
most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in
comparison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be
healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out
for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during
Sunday's game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night
against Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should
be able to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen
has a sprained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at
this point. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Leaf will get his chance to
win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. "If we're going to get an
evaluation on him, this is the open window," coach Dave Campo said. "At
this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than the third
quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity." In any event, Leaf's
value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order
to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his
status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Swinton (hamstring) will not practice this week in order to rest his
injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for
the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Thomas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is now
expected to miss the remainder of the season. Thomas has no real Fantasy
value at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against
Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has
had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever
he has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the <I>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</I>. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter
right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he
is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to
the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. "There's more to it than just a
normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren said Monday. "He's injured, and he won't practice this week."
Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect
him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson
could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the <I>Kansas City Star</I>.
Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he
sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were
expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during
Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the <I>Miami Herald</I>. He
should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in
San Diego, according to the <I>Denver Post</I>. However, An MRI Monday
morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to
his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's
practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to
get the start.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville
despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all
year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't
use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left
knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is
out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets
despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week,"
coach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him
playing completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate
will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a
decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the
situation throughout the week. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle
Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle
Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the
rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined
three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a
kickoff return Sunday.

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told <i>The Akron Plain-Dealer</i> that
Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens.
Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if
you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the
most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will
play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson
in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay
Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw
interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the
fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. "I'm
still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see
if I was alive," he said, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready." 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during
Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the
injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to
Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis.
The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be
in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be
available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a
decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we
expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over
Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble
time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday
night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy
player at this point. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his
hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks
of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact
Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring
any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was
dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo
tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be
determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would
step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from
playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever
bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad
idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay
due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for
the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good
numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I>, Bennett (ankle) is
expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a
protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug
Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/16/01
Muhammad suffered a hip injury during Sunday's loss to the New Orleans
Saints. However, the injury won't keep him from playing in this weekend's
game against Washington. Considering the Redskins' woes, it's a good idea
to start Muhammad Fantasy-wise. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Weinke is dealing with a slight thigh injury, but he is expected to play on
Sunday against Washington. With the state of the Redskins team, Weinke may
be worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/15/01
Moore suffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It
was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy
value is these days. He is listed as day-to-day. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the
<I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't
worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when
Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami
on Oct. 28. "The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,"
Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so
far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played
mistake-free football.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/15/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in
Week Six.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is
not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/15/01
Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The <i>Denver
Post</i> says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday.
"I was able to come back and play this week, and I'm hoping to do the same
next week," Griese said.

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He
injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might
now become Cincinanti's third receiver. 

Terry Jackson, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next
week's game at Chicago. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Johnson (neck) looked good in practice on
Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. ""He threw the ball extremely
well, especially in the wind today," said coach Gregg Williams. "He had a
fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now." 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/15/01
A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is
expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/15/01
Mathis shook off a hip injury and played in Sunday's game. However, a
sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury
isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a
day to day basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left
big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/15/01
The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams
originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral
ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage. Rams
coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three
weeks. "They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to
four weeks," Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes
it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New
Orleans Saints on October 28. "We'll see," Faulk said. "It's kind of early
to say, but you never know." 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/15/01
Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on
Carolina's second possession, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as
he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers
led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for
196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now. 

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether.

Luccis Losers Player News

Charlie Garner, Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Steve McNair, Injured QB Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Cameron Cleeland, Active TE Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter
after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action
after being sidelined for only one play. 

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Alstott will once again be the Bucs' featured back in Warrick Dunn's
absence. He may not post good yardage numbers against Tennessee, but
Alstott does have a good shot at putting up a touchdown against the Titans. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis.
Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Booker has been one of the season's early sleepers Fantasy-wise. He'll have
a great chance at posting bug numbers against a shaky Arizona secondary, so
give him the starting nod this week. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in
Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular
early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Active WR Updated 09/08/01
Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the Rams' season opener
Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potential is limited as a
No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't very high.

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
