Latest NFL Player News

Reidel Anthony <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1860&> , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn't been a main receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don't use him in a Fantasy league. 

Dave Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Moore missed Wednesday's practice with a right ankle sprain, but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Tennessee. He hasn't proven a reliable Fantasy tight end thus far, so don't use him this week. 

Jacquez Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you use him against the tough Titans secondary this week.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice Thursday or Friday, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Provided he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you take your chances, and instead only use Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at running back. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, talk out of Packers practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next few games. We're not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive, but there's a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams this season. Just don't start him against the stifling Ravens defense this week. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. 

Chris Chandler <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some short-yardage packages.

Patrick Jeffers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close to full speed, says the Charlotte Observer. "He's still working his way into being ready," Seifert said. "He's starting to capture my imagination." 

Marcus Robinson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . He isn't on the Bears' injury report, and we think he'll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he doesn't suffer a setback.

Shane Matthews <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don't use him as a Fantasy starter right now. 

Fred Baxter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1355&>, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a hip injury. He's a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.

Damon Washington <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=146364&>, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams. 

Ron Dayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear that he will play against St. Louis.

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams. 

Frank Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His current status is day to day.

Robert Thomas <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=134236&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However, the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday's game against Washington. Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Saints <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=18&>, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday's game against Carolina with a strained left quadriceps. He'll be listed as doubtful, but there is an outside chance that he'll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense and is listed as probable on the Seahawks' injury report. Although no official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get the start over Trent Dilfer this week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01
Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November. "I'm not going to put a target date on it," Davis told the Denver Post. "I'm just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see where I am at the end of this week, and we'll go from there. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday's game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. "It's not structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see why there is some soreness from the MRIs," Dick Vermeil said. "He's just got to work through it." Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander's place. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=235256&>, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as the third receiver. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Wilkins is questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland with a rib injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin at wideout against the Raiders.

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12783&>, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.

Terry Glenn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the weekend. 

John Hall <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1705&>, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day, although there are no plans for an MRI.

Derrick Mason <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1816&>, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. "Eddie was better by the end of practice. He is still sore," head coach Jeff Fisher told The Tennessean. "He is doing more than what I thought he would do considering where he was after the game." Fisher also added that George would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday. The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is inactive. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Hines Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Ward was held out of practice Wednesday to let a toe injury heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in Week Two.
