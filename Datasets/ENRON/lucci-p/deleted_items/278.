Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, an MRI on Faulk's right knee revelead a bone bruise, and no cartilage or ligament damage. He is expected to miss at least one game before being re-evaluated.

Eddie Kennison <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1296&> , WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,

Shaun Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler <http://football215.fa! nt! asy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12363&>, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 




Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187742&>Vinny Testaverde <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1221&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
M! il! burn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch <http://football21! 5.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187388&>, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1790&>,! W! R NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.

Travis Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187399&>, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.

Terry Glenn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receivers. 

Jason Brookins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD agai! ns! t Green Bay. The young, strong back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears on. 

Troy Brown <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1253&>, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117 yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1212&>, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1204&>, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1663&>, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson <http://fo! ot! ball215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=133324&>, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy player.

Tom Brady <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187741&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235220&>, R! B ! CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235249&>, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12375&>, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a s! ol! id game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week, but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1174&> , RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after offseason toe surgery.
