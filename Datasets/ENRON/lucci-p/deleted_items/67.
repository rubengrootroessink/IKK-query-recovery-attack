Thanks.  That Kennedy Oil deal still needs to be in Sitara b/c it is causing an imbalance in my positions.  If the deal is in Tagg, it needs to be in Sitara. Does that make sense?  Let me know.

No don't worry about shoving work off on us.  And we will work through the Kennedy Oil deal later.  It doesn't start until Dec.

O.k.  Not trying to shove off work on you guys!  Also, there was that Kennedy Oil (Glenrock) deal done last week.  We still do not have a Sitara # for that deal. Any news on that?

Quick question...in regards to this EJW Family deal that I just received across the fax....there is a note that says "Please enter 92 mmbtu/day @ GDP-CIG/RKYMTN.  Do I need to enter this as an additional deal?   Let me know.  I need to book this deal before 4 p.m.  Thank you!

Paul,

I will definitely do some more investigative work on this.  I need to load our curves right now.  Can I get back to you about this tomorrow?  I am pretty swamped today.  Thanks.

Please look these over to see if these are all the fixed price financial deals Sinclair has with us.  


Thanks
