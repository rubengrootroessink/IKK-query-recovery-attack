Scouting Report Special Edition---Where technology hits home.

Every year, the worlds most innovative electronics companies meet in Las Ve=
gas to unveil their newest creations. The Consumer Electronics Show feature=
s thousands of new products and is attended by every major retailer in the =
world. Unfortunately, most of these retailers are limited by a lack of shel=
f space and convoluted distribution systems. By the time the newest technol=
ogy makes it to their stores, it is not so new. That is not the case at Tec=
hnoScout.com, where you can find the latest, greatest, neatest and coolest =
products, often before they are available in stores. Here is one of our fav=
orite products from this years show.=20

Your radio just got 5,000 new stations=20

The iRhythm Wireless Remote Tuner makes it easy to listen to the best progr=
ams in the world in high fidelity without hard-wired connections.

If you believe you have been missing something great from your PC and Inter=
net connection, you may be right. It is radio from stations throughout Nort=
h America and around the world in high fidelity. If you know about Net radi=
o, you realize that hundreds of radio stations from everywhere in the world=
 are broadcast over the Internet. The trouble is, you have to surf the Web =
to find them (that can take hours). Then you have to listen to them in fron=
t of your PC over small speakers. The iRhythm Wireless Internet Remote Tune=
r from Sonicbox solves both of these problems effortlessly. The system give=
s you the software and components to turn your stereo into a high fidelity =
receiver of Best of Planet TM Internet radio stations. Even more, you do no=
t need a high-speed Internet connection, and there is no wiring necessary b=
etween your PC and stereo. Once you set up the iRhythm Remote Tuner you can=
 dial up any station on the Internet without touching your computer as long=
 as it is turn! ed on. A handheld RF remote control lets you switch station=
s from anywhere in your house up to 100 feet away from your computer (throu=
gh walls and floors), using the same kind of 900 MHz frequency used on cord=
less telephones.=20
