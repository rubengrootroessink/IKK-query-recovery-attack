Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Trent Dilfer will start at quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks for one
more week while Hasselbeck recovers from a groin injury, coach Mike
Holmgren said Thursday. Hasselbeck, who has a pulled left groin, practiced
Wednesday, but sat out Thursday's practice. 

Reidel Anthony, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is
expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn't been a main
receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don't use him in a Fantasy
league.

Dave Moore, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Moore missed Wednesday's practice with a right ankle sprain, but is
expected to play in Sunday's game at Tennessee. He hasn't proven a reliable
Fantasy tight end thus far, so don't use him this week.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is
expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you use him
against the tough Titans secondary this week.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice
Thursday or Friday, according to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. Provided
he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in
Tennessee. We don't recommend you take your chances, and instead only use
Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at
running back.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
According to the <I>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</I>, talk out of Packers
practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next
few games. We're not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority
of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive,
but there's a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams
this season. Just don't start him against the stifling Ravens defense this
week.

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned
to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on
a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start
this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in
some short-yardage packages.

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close
to full speed, says the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>. "He's still working his
way into being ready," Seifert said. "He's starting to capture my
imagination."

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired
back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to
the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He isn't on the Bears' injury report, and we
think he'll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he
doesn't suffer a setback.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona
with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don't
use him as a Fantasy starter right now.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a
hip injury. He's a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks
like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear
that he will play against St. Louis.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for
Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His
current status is day to day.

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However,
the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday's game against Washington.
Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

 Saints, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday's game against Carolina with a
strained left quadriceps. He'll be listed as doubtful, but there is an
outside chance that he'll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the
Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense
Fantasy-wise. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense
and is listed as probable on the Seahawks' injury report. Although no
official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get
the start over Trent Dilfer this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01
Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making
cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November.
"I'm not going to put a target date on it," Davis told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. "I'm just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see
where I am at the end of this week, and we'll go from there. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
The <i>Kansas City Star</i> says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday's
game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. "It's not
structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see
why there is some soreness from the MRIs," Dick Vermeil said. "He's just
got to work through it." Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander's
place.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon
is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is
questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as
the third receiver.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Wilkins is questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland with a rib
injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin
at wideout against the Raiders.

Mike Vanderjagt, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he
is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be
ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the
weekend.

John Hall, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day,
although there are no plans for an MRI.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was
so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's
game. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. "Eddie was
better by the end of practice. He is still sore," head coach Jeff Fisher
told <i>The Tennessean</i>. "He is doing more than what I thought he would
do considering where he was after the game." Fisher also added that George
would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday.
The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is
inactive. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal.
He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Ward was held out of practice Wednesday to let a toe injury heal. He is
expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on
October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in
Week Two. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury and did not practice Wednesday.
However he is listed as probable for this week's game and might resume
practicing on Thursday. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Heap's condition is more doubtful than questionable for Sunday's game,
according to <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. Heap is still recovering from an
ankle injury and missed practice for the second consecutive day Wednesday.
Shannon Sharpe will get most of the looks at tight end if Heap is inactive. 

R.Jay Soward, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars got official notice Wednesday that Soward will be out another
six weeks because of a suspension. Soward, the team's first-round draft
pick in 2000, missed the first four games for his first violation. He could
have returned this week, but now won't be eligible to return until Nov. 26
-- if the Jaguars want him back at all. "He obviously is a young man who
has outstanding talent, but he also has a cross to bear," Coughlin said.
"For him to ever play again, he's got to do something about it." Soward
could have been Jacksonville's third receiver this season, but now his
career with the team is in jeopardy. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Batch has reclaimed the starting quarterback job with the Lions. While he
can't be any worse than Ty Detmer, we don't recommend you expect either QB
to provide your team with good Fantasy stats.

Daimon Shelton, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
The Bears signed Leon Johnson to the 53-man roster on Tuesday. He would
help fill the void created by Shelton's four-game suspension, which is
under appeal. Johnson isn't an impact Fantasy player, so don't pick him up.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/10/01
Wycheck is expected to play in this week's game against the Buccaneers. He
was forced out of the team's previous game after suffering a strained neck. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/10/01
An MRI on George's ankle revealed Tuesday that his ankle injury is not a
high ankle sparin. George is expected to play in Sunday's game against
Tampa Bay and will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Bettis is expected to play in this week's game against Kansas City but will
be listed as probable. He is recovering from a minor knee injury. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Ward will be listed as probable for this week's game but is expected to
play. He is recovering from a toe injury. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Dawkins left Sunday's game in the third quarter with a rib injury and did
not return. His status for this week's game is in doubt. Alvis Whitted will
get more playing time in his absence. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Santiago is expected to replace Rickey Dudley as the starting tight end.
Santiago hasn't caught a pass this season but will be a reasonable pickup
given the lack of talent at tight end. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Heap is still recovering from an ankle injury but might resume practicing
on Wednesday. He missed Sunday's game because of the injury. 

Sebastian Janikowski, K OAK - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/10/01
Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that was suffered
during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and should play
against the Colts this week.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/10/01
Alexander is questionable for Week Five with a back problem. Chris Thomas
will start in his place if Alexander can't play.

Tony Simmons, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Simmons was signed by the Colts. He will not play often enough to help
Fantasy owners.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/10/01
The bye week should give Johnson sufficient time to heal from a pinched
nerve in his neck. He is expected to play in Week Six against Jacksonville.

Bert Emanuel, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Emanuel was released by the Patriots, who needed to clear roster space for
Terry Glenn. The move, however, does not necessarily mean Glenn will be
available to play in Week Five.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/10/01
Williams (shoulder) is expected to practice on Wednesday. The stud running
back has a sprained AC joint in his shoulder, but it didn't seem to effect
him on Sunday against Minnesota. Barring a major setback, Williams will be
fine for this weekend's game against Carolina. 

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Washington suffered a sprained shoulder during Sunday's game against the
Redskins. His status is questionable for this weekend's game against St.
Louis. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/10/01
Dayne (neck) was still sore on Tuesday, so his availability for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is uncertain. An MRI revealed no serious damage, and
X-rays on his neck were negative. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was "fairly hopeful" that Dayne would be ready. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Barber (hamstring) resumed running on Tuesday, but his status for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is still uncertain. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was "reasonably hopeful" that Barber would be
available, but no definitive decision has been made. 

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury,
officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. "It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,"
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. "People don't know how bad
this is hurting." The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is now expected to miss four-to-six weeks due to a hamstring injury.
Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much
Fantasy value at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interested in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. "I said it before and I'll say it
again," Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. "Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback." Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. "It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it," Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. "People
don't know how bad this is hurting." Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.
