+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. He threw very little in practice and is still
suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is
unable to play. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to
<i>The Pioneer Press</i>. Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to
play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on
November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a
broken collarbone but the <i>Atlanta Journal-constitution</i> reports that
he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier
this season. McGarity has minimal value now, but he might eventually work
his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he
will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The
injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve
Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly
as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and
other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be really
ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated,"
Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons
and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley,
who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate
at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he
expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The <i>Detroit
Free Press</i> reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a
bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at
Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams'
defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of
dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked
Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second
half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as
"post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the
injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was
given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie
Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and
could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to
play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year
and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has
been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained
on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game
against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the
weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be
limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of
fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo
said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to
play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move.
Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL.
He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards
and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and
coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to
have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a
final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game
until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf
if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance
that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been
with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week.
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the <i>Denver Post</i>, but Davis'
leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If
Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe
Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer
caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a
reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last
season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach
Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and
said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet
passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced
by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League
and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40
straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after
receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.

Bert Emanuel, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are
looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending
injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job.
Don't bother picking him up.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for
Monday's game against Tennessee.

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn
patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The New York <i>Daily News</i> says there is still a noticeable hitch in
Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect
him to return is Dec. 2.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on
the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting
lineup. But the <i>Kansas City Star</i> notes Chris Thomas is still working
with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player
will start on Thursday against the Colts.

Larry Foster, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Foster is expected to start in
Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an
inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right
now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments
in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play
in a keeper league.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
According to the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, the Bengals worked out three
kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is
a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress
in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to
the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's
absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a
chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer.
Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside
Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for
Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on
Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will
be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib
Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the
Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He
is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice
tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it
will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach
Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game
against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any
problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. "It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said.
"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day," Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, White will start in place of the
injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching
abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper
leagues. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus
Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. <I>The Chicago Sun-Times</I> is now
reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell
being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The
team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game
against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular
season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring
injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see
him by now, McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "That's why we both
handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning
to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he
can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him." If Moore is still
on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday
night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron
Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge
of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week
Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here's a golden
opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks
to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep
him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice
this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye
on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"
Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. "Warrick
pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who
it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured,
so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week
Seven.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at
Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he
should have time to recover. "It'll be OK," Favre told the <I>Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel</I>. "Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that
will help."

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a
sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren
finished the game in his absence.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> reports that the Bears will continue to use an
alternating system with him and James Allen. "We will continue to use them
both," said offensive coordinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job
today, though." As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard
to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe
Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not
believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some
carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a
one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's
still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.

Robert Wilson, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard
reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be
evaluated on a daily basis. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/22/01
Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in
Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider
adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards
on Sunday.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with
Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss
next week's game against Detroit.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/22/01
Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week's game
is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/22/01
Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating
Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated
on a daily basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also
burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength,
but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on
November 4. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the
Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again
until November 4. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't
necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball
successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for
Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the
patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the
second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry
Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field
with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will
be the primary receiver in his absence.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in
goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards.
He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has
clearly emerged as a featured back.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21
carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the
second half. "We couldn't do anything in the second half," Williams said.
"We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made
plays." Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams
this Sunday. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and
39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to
be an adequate starter for the rest of the season. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/22/01
Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is
out for the season. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week.

Luccis Losers Player News

Steve McNair, Injured QB Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Active WR Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Duce Staley, Reserve RB Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Ravens, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in
Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular
early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
