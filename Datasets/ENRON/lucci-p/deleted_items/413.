HopeFUL Romantic... 
I sometimes think I'm a walking contradiction: I'm feminine but like
being "one of the guys", cynical but trusting, opinionated but

Down to earth vet seeking new people and friendships 
I am 29, average build with good looks. I am conservative and cautious
when it comes to dating, especially on an internet site, but am open to
