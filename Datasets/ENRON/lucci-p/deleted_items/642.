Why in the world would I want a picture of you at one of your gay bars?????    So did you crop out your backdoor man?
Really quit trying to hit on me. I'm not bi.  

Or is that a picture of you at the new Vail condo? If it's at the Vail condo then it's ok that you're gay.  

So what's up with you? I see the ski trip is starting to take form. You know we have to go meet the All Girl Ski team.
So are you getting ready for them? Damn they about killed me last time. Those steep, tight tree trails. And then the last run of the day - the ski run from hell.    

I was just thinking. Have you ever been to my place? (reminder to Pual: Donnie is not gay) One of these days if you're in town maybe a group of us could go out to eat or something.  

Later  
Heavy D
