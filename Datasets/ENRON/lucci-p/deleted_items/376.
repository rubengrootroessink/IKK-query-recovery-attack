Latest NFL Player News

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team."

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury." 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place. 

Tim Dwight, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not
produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time
in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most
Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current
status is day to day.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is
day to day. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to
play this week. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on
Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected
to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will
be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He
might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained
73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week.
Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday
against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a
groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's
playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His
health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will
likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more
work over the final three games of the season, according to the
<I>Nashville Tennessean</I>. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said.
"We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played
[Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This
development will limit George's production over the final three weeks,
making him a risky start.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back
which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is
unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he
should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next
couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against
Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear,
but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a
separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably
start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his
backup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the
remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable
weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay
and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time
the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this
week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't
reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on
the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's
strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether
Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth
starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury
Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to
reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will
probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we
don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati
after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10
carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three
after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy
starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie
Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not
expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale
against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs,
especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at
any time.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a
sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game
against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you
consider using him this week.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/18/01
Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against
Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine his true status
for the game. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past few weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Davis suffered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. "He's
sore today, but he has indicated he'll be fine," Coach Marty Schottenheimer
told the <I>Washington Post</I>. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to
start against Chicago in Week 15. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Banks will remain the Redskins'
starting quarterback. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach
Marty Schottemheimer is expected to stick with him rather than go with
backup Kent Graham. 

Frank Murphy, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Murphy suffered a severely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago.
The injury will likely keep him out of this weekend's game against New
Orleans. 

 Buccaneers, DT TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured
during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this
week, but should be available for Week 15. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Bouman strained a ligament on the palm side of the thumb during the
Vikings' 27-24 loss Sunday at Detroit. He will be listed as probable for
Week 15, but Bouman said he isn't sure he'll be ready in time for Sunday's
game vs. Jacksonville. Third-stringer Spergon Wynn would get the start if
Bouman is unable to play. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star Tribune</I>, Culpepper will have
surgery on his left knee this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. There
is an outside chance that he could play in Minnesota's season finale
against Baltimore, but that seems unlikely at this point. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Franks suffered a mild ankle sprain during Sunday's loss to Tennessee. The
injury isn't serious, however, so Franks will be in the starting lineup in
Week 15 against Cleveland. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Foster suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Minnesota. The
extent of the injury is still unclear, so the team doesn't expect to know
his status for Week 15 until Wednesday. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/18/01
Stewart suffered a slight hip pointer during Sunday's game against
Minnesota. The injury isn't considered serious, so look for Stewart to be
in the starting lineup on Sunday against Pittsburgh. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/18/01
Walls missed practice on Monday due to an ankle injury. However, Head Coach
George Seifert expects his veteran tight end to be available for Sunday's
game against St. Louis. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Muhammad is dealing with a slight case of turf toe, which caused him to
miss practice on Monday. However, Coach George Seifert expects his veteran
wideout to start this weekend against St. Louis. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Jenkins suffered a sprained ankle in the second half of Saturday's game
against the N.Y. Giants. He was still very sore on Monday, so his status
for Sunday's game vs. Dallas won't be known until later in the week. 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage
in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday
against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick
Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the
team's placekicker. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
Price's ankle is still stiff and sore. Head coach Gregg Williams will
evaluate him on a daily basis, according to published reports. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he shouldn't miss his
next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed no broken bones.
Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some practice before
Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the quarterback to
play. 

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 12/17/01
Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season by the
team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major
disappointment for Fantasy leaguers this year. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man
in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in
the team's final three games. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle
coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren
said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide
whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said.
The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time
of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status
is day to day. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is
day to day.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher
has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some
carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to
day.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day
to day. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing
time. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any
playing time. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not
believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for
the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is
expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated
shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of
the year. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for
Week 15.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his
hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the
severity of his injured right knee. "It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not
sure what's going to happen," Henry said. "It's a part of football. It was
an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went.
Hopefully, it's not too serious." 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and
might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right
now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a
banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the
Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the
team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is
moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from
Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing
yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a
poor performance. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against
Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of
starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks? numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no
touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn?t reliable enough to
be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be
one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and
two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will
be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured
Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in
the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when
Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12
carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries,
but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an
interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any
league. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a
sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit
on Sunday. "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach
Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you
never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting
out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to
doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps
on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was
officially listed as inactive. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/16/01
Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB
has been very inconsistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a
few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Pinkston left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter with a
shoulder injury. He did not return to the contest, and finished with two
catches for 77 yards and a score. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San
Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any
Fantasy team during the playoffs.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an
injured right ankle. He was replaced by Shaun Alexander.

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was
held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Garcia left Sunday's game with sore ribs in the first half, then returned
for a short stint. However, Tim Rattay played much of the second half in
his place. Garcia finished the game with 133 yards passing and a touchdown. 

Scotty Anderson, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/16/01
Anderson caught one pass for 69 yards against Minnesota. He will catch an
occasional long ball, but Anderson is not producing enough to be useful for
most Fantasy teams right now. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
McMahon threw for 241 yards and rushed for 74 yards and a TD against
Minnesota. He will be a sevicable backup during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Really Rottens Updated 12/16/01
Bennett rushed for only 40 yards on 10 carries at Detroit. The rookie back
is too inconsistent to rely on during the Fantasy postseason. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Price caught four passes for 67 yards against New England. He appears to be
Buffalo's most reliable Fantasy player at this time. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
The Bills held Glenn to 27 yards on three catches. Glenn has missed too
much time this year to regularly post good numbers for New England. 

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 12/16/01
Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an
interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be
a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 12/16/01
Rhodes rushed for 177 yards and two TDs against Atlanta. The Colts are out
of the playoff hunt, yet Rhodes will keep many Fantasy teams in the running
for a title. 

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 12/16/01
Manning got back on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an
interception against the Colts. He remains a must-start player in all
Fantasy leagues.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver.
He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alexander is still a risky
play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Martin caught seven passes for 84 yards and a TD at Indianapolis. Don't
expect consistently good numbers from him during the Fantasy postseason.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Holmes had another solid game, posting 121 yards rushing and a touchdown
against Denver. He's a must-start every week during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 12/16/01
Smith had a huge game against Kansas City, posting eight catches for 100
yards and a score. His injured ankles didn't seem to hamper him in the
contest, which is good news for owners depending on Smith during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Chandler threw for 249 yards, two TDs and no interceptions at Indianapolis.
If he remains healthy, Chandler will continue to be a reliable QB during
the Fantasy playoffs.

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Garner had 113 scrimmage yards against San Diego on Saturday. He was held
out of the end zone for the third straight week, however, and has only
scored two touchdowns the entire season. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine
numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night
Football. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 12/14/01
McKnight has not been a reliable Fantasy receiver this year. Don't expect
much from him on the road at San Francisco.

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be
able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to
Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland.
His current status is day to day.

Mike Alstott, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Alstott rushed for 66 yards and a TD and caught four passes for 34 yards
against Detroit. The Tampa Bay fullback will be a regular scoring threat
during the Fantasy postseason.

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 12/09/01
Cleeland is expected to play on Sunday against Atlanta. According to the
<I>Times Picayune</I>, however, Cleeland will be the No. 3 tight end behind
Boo Williams and Lamont Hall. Cleeland will be used in certain goal-line
situations, which makes him worth considering in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Booker was completely held in check on Sunday by Green Bay. He caught only
two passes for 14 yards in the game, which was easily his worst outing of
the season. 

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
The Chargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught
five passes for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to
utilize Staley as the NFL regular season winds down.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Hayes has been too unreliable this season to warrant a starting spot in
most Fantasy leagues. The return of Muhsin Muhammad may help his numbers in
Week 13, but he's still far too risky to start. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17
loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
