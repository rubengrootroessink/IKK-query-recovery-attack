Latest NFL Player News

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is
one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will
likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games.
Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be
allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until
Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in
Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner
will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in
goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of
Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a
Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati
due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills
Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not
being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing
two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said
after Friday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of
the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't
recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if
you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,
Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth
considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of
consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better
quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in
your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good
to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the
Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to
an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that
has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347
yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his
potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially
against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11
catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis
squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this
week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's
averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again
emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10
against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three
games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can
be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep
Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this
weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is
worth considering. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your
Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a
tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of
deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored
only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary
this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on
his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one
of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the
formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on
his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is
somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will
have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting
either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.
He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a
real gamble. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one
of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San
Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75
yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this
week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this
season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable
secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in
eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better
option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on
a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected
to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against
Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green
Bay. 

Reuben Droughns, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield
this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy
value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble. 

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday
against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth
starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Batch will again lose playing time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will
be the No. 2 QB again, but will see playing time as the Lions continue to
use two quarterbacks. As a result, you may want to look for another
signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. 

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sloan is an unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for
minus-2 yard performance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league,
starting Sloan isn't advisable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week
against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards
passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is
worth taking a chance on in Week 10. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games this
season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous
Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy
leagues. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed
as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if
he plays. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three games, so starting
him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable
at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. The
Vikings sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starting
Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/16/01
Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in
Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary
would start in his place.

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Bennett is expected to return to action after missing three game with a
high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Doug Chapman on Monday
night against the Giants, making him a risky start on your Fantasy team. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Pathon (foot) is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie
Wayne should start in his place.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Alexander (ankle) did not practice on Friday, and is out for Sunday's game
against Denver. William Rasby and Zeron Flemister will likely split time at
tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither player has any real Fantasy
value.

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Linebacker Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday against
Denver. "We wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective,"
Redskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the <I>Washington Post</I>. "I
think he'll be effective." He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle
a few weeks ago. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley has strep throat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now
questionable for Sunday's game as he also makes his way back from a knee
injury.

 Eagles, DT PHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed practice on Wednesday with a quadriceps
injury. He is expected to return to practice, however, and should be ready
in time for Sunday's game against Dallas. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kinney missed practice Thursday and is not expected to play. He has been
hindered by a calf injury for over a month.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Smith (ankle) has missed two consecutive days of practice. He is still
expected to play against the Chargers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Ward has clearly become a fine receiver, however, he doesn't catch TD
passes very often. He is nothing more than a Fantasy reserve right now. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
According to the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I>, Davis' hamstring has
healed to the point where he is almost ready to return to action. "This
week I really let it go," Davis said. "I opened it up. I think I'm ready
right now. It's not easy to get back into football shape, but it's coming.
If called upon, I could play." Davis could return as early as Thanksgiving,
when Green Bay faces the Detroit Lions at the Silverdome. With Bubba Franks
playing well, however, Davis likely won't make a huge Fantasy impact. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Bettis has overcome a wrist injury in recent weeks and remains a top-notch
Fantasy RB. Look for him to play well against Jacksonville this week. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Zereoue practiced Thursday and is expected to play Thursday. He has been
sidelined for over a month because of a shoulder injury. Zereoue should get
some carries this week and will be used periodically to spell Jerome
Bettis. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Brady has been ineffective all season. Don't expect him to be too
productive against Pittsburgh. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith has been consistent all season. He is one of the top receivers in
Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to <I>footballinjuries.com</I>, Weinke practiced on Thursday
without incident, but he's still hasn't been named the starter for Sunday's
game against San Francisco. "To be quite frank with you, I don't know if
Chris will start," said coach George Seifert. "I would not stand here right
now and say that is what is going to happen. Quite seriously, I am not
playing any coaching games. I just don't know if it's the best thing right
now or if he's totally ready. I haven't come to a conclusion yet watching
practice." Matt Lytle will likely start his second straight game if Weinke
is unable to play. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Taylor remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will likely be used on a
limited basis if he does play. Taylor has been sidelined for over a month
with a groin injury. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Hambrick practiced on Thursday, but his shoulder is still a bit sore. He'll
start at tailback if Emmitt Smith is unable to play Sunday, but he would
not play fullback if Smith starts. Hambrick's shoulder is too sore to block
effectively, so unless he is Dallas' featured back, he's not worth starting
on your Fantasy team this week. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Joseph will get some carries this week in the absence of Fred Taylor, but
will be used primarily on third-down situations. Don't expect him to be
productive. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith (knee) returned to practice on Thursday, and felt pretty good after
the workout. According to <I>footballinjuries.com</I>, if Smith practices
without incident on Friday, he'll have an excellent chance at starting in
Sunday's game against Philadelphia. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Couch has been consistent all season despite a lack of overall talent at
wideout. Look for him to be a productive starter once again this week. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, the Lions will continue to give McMahon
some snaps during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but
this development means that Charlie Batch will lose some playing time, and
could be an endorsement for McMahon in the future. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Jackson is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Baltimore
because of a sore ankle. Don't expect him to be too productive if he does
play. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dillon has been a consistent runner all season and remains worthy of No. 1
RB status on many Fantasy teams. Even if opponents limit his yardage
numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Kitna should be a solid Fantasy QB. Expect him to throw for at least 200
yards and a touchdown.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Warrick will catch some passes but don't expect him to score. He has one TD
reception this season. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Look for Sharpe to catch a few passes this week and accumulate an adequate
amount of receiving yards. He has been one of best tight ends this season. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Taylor has been a disappointment this season catching just two TD passes.
Don't expect him to be productive this week. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Ismail had 85 receiving yards and a TD reception in the first game against
Cleveland this year. Expect him to play well once again this week. Ismail
has been productive all season. 

Obafemi Ayanbadejo, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Ayanbadejo will get carries in short yardage and goal-line situations.
However, he won't gain enough yards to be a productive Fantasy starter. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Brookins will get a lot of carries this week in the absence of Terry Allen.
However, FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo will probably be used more in goal-line
situations. Nevertheless, Brookins should be an adequate No. 2 back. 

Moe Williams, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Williams will get some playing time Sunday in the absence of Terry allen,
but will likely be used on third down situations. "Femi [Obafemi
Ayanbadejo] and Brook [Jason Brookins] are going to carry most of it,"
Williams told <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. "I'll just try and get in when I
can." 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair watched practice Thursday with ice wrapped around his sore and
swollen thumb. McNair injured the thumb on his throwing hand during the
first half of Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He couldn't grip a
ball Wednesday and didn't throw one Thursday. The Titans play at Cincinnati
on Sunday. "There's a chance he may throw the ball a little bit tomorrow
[Friday]," coach Jeff Fisher said. A splint that had been on his hand
Wednesday was gone, replaced by tape on the thumb and index finger.
Swelling around the base of the thumb is the biggest problem. McNair is
still listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He probably won't be able
to throw the ball too well if he does play. Consider starting another QB. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against Green Bay. He may
see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him virtaully
worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper league,
continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting nod. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kelly is doubtful for Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury.
He'll be replaced by Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from
Kelly from this point on. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't
change this weekend against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass
defense, so starting Martin isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starting
spot this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike
Anderson. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday.
There is still no offical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/15/01
Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game against the Cardinals, so be sure to reserve him again this
week. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, it has been confirmed that James will miss
the rest of the season with a knee injury. He will need surgery to repair a
torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for the rest of the year, and
Kevin McDougal should be his backup. Shyrone Stith may also see some work
if needed. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Graham may post good numbers at Oakland. San Diego will look to the air
often if the Raiders concentrate on stopping the run.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/15/01
Tomlinson may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will
be fired up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Rice has not helped his Fantasy owners much in recent weeks. But he is
still worth a start against the inconsistent San Diego secondary.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/15/01
Brown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his
best in intradivisional matchups.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/15/01
Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. He might not do much
against a tough San Diego run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/15/01
Wheatley is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He
is a risky start because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the
San Diego defense.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Gannon should rebound from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an
important home game with San Diego.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/15/01
Gary was inactive for the last two games, but he will now see carries again
because Terrell Davis is injured. He still may not play enough to help most
Fantasy teams.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Clark will continue to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB
will now lean heavily on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have
crippled the Broncos at wideout.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Expect Carswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries
at WR will make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/15/01
McNabb had a huge game against Minnesota last weekend, and should have more
success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a top-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of
a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Freddie Mitchell, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Mitchell sprained his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this
weekend against Dallas. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with
a few more good outings, and is worth stashing away on your roster. 

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/15/01
Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for the Broncos this week.
Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole into extra playing
time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in the past, so don't
use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's passing game.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/15/01
Pinkston has fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start
to the season. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't
even worth a roster spot at this point. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/15/01
Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one of
the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dallas
earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/15/01
Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in his last two games, and is worth
starting this week against Dallas. He may be inconsistent at times, but
when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by
injuries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers
downfield.

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Galloway was terrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan
Leaf's inability to get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in
a deeper league, Galloway isn't worth starting in Week 10. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown last weekend, but
he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league,
Harris isn't worth a roster spot.
