Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. "We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore," Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes." Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. "If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,"
he said. "I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated." Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. "I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes," Mike Riley. "But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "It's a
coincidence," Barlow said. "It was my turn in the rotation to be in there."
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. "We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday," Dennis Green said. "I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective."

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team."

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury." 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place.
