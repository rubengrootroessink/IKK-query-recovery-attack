What parties are you going to.  I've got two parties and a band I want to see.  Cabs are too expensive.  Figure out where you guys want to go and then let's talk.  What are you going as, hopefully cat woman in a skin-tight cat suit.  So you better pad your bra!

Update!  Jeff the DUI guy wants to party, so no go on the driving.  Like I guessed, Nat and Lorena are going to pass on the limo.  So, taxi is probably the best bet.  We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to "get ready" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?
