Hey you!  I had a great time also.  I  have been on the phone all morning.  As soon as I turn up the stereo the phone rings.  Use this email address in the future, it's easier for me. plucci@enron.com  I know that address may not be around very long.  I talked to my boss this morning about moving our group to another company.  It seems one of the larger natural gas producers wants to start a group like ours.  We interview soon!  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk soon.

Paul

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your
