> There was a preacher whose wife was expecting a baby.  So he went to
> the congregation and asked for a raise.  After much consideration and
> discussion, they passed a rule that when the preacher's family
> expanded, so would his paycheck.
>
> Well, after 6 children, this started to get expensive so the congregation
> decided to hold a meeting again to discuss the preacher's pay situation.
> As you can imagine, there was much yelling and bickering.  Finally, the
> preacher got up and spoke to the crowd.  "Having children is an act of
> God!"
> he said.
>
> In the back of the room, a little old man stood up and in his frail voice
> said,
> "Snow and rain are also acts of God but when we get too much of it,
> we wear rubbers."
