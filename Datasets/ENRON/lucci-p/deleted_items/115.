 Pilot Humor...
 During taxi, the crew of a US Air departure flight to Ft.Lauderdale made a
wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727. The irate ground
controller (a female) lashed out at the US Air crew screaming "US Air 2771,
where are you going? I told you to turn right on Charlie taxi way; you
turned right on Delta. Stop right there. I know it's difficult to tell the
difference between C's and D's but get it right". Continuing her lashing to
the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically, "God, you've
screwed everything up; it'll take forever to sort this out. You stay right
there and don't move until I tell you to. You can expect progressive taxi
instructions in about a half hour and I want you to go exactly where tell
you, when I tell you, and how I tell you. You got that, USAir 2771??"

 The humbled crew responded: "Yes Ma'am". Naturally, the ground control
frequency went terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air Flight
2771. No one wanted to engage the irate ground controller in her current
state. Tension in every cockpit at LGA was running high.

 Shortly after the controller finished her admonishment of the U.S. Air
crew, an unknown male pilot broke the silence and asked: "Wasn't I married
to you once?"
