Back up your hard drive RIGHT NOW!

*For a limited time, we are offering free shipping and handling when you place your order on this new breakthrough product!!*

With the Pockey Portable Drive, up to 20 GB of files are easy to store and carry - and even easier to afford.

The Pockey Portable Drive is small enough to fit in your shirt pocket, plugs into (and is powered by) your computers USB port, and delivers more capacity for the money than any other similar device. Up to 20 GB of storage, at a cost that is far less than other devices! Save files from your desktop computer in your Pockey drive and take them to business meetings along with your laptop. Even data-rich files like sales presentations, engineering drawings, spreadsheets, and customer databases are no problem. And by accessing files from your Pockey drive, you keep your notebook free of data you do not need to store. Maybe you do not have the problems of a road warrior, but you want an external drive to store and carry digital photos, mp3 files, or even games and movies. Again, Pockey is the answer. 

Save your files with Pockey Portable Hard Drive <http://offer.technoscout.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hLoF0CL8Se0Ev70Nx40AJ>!
