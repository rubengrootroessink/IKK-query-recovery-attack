Latest NFL Player News

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/27/01
Bledsoe will dress for Sunday's game against the Broncos but he won't play.
He is expected to be listed as the No. 3 QB but is still another 2-3 weeks
away from returning. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/27/01
James could miss the Indianapolis Colts game next week at Buffalo because
of a sprained left knee. James injured the knee with about 4:30 left in
Thursday's 35-28 victory at Kansas City. Colts coach Jim Mora said James
had an MRI exam Friday confirmed he had a sprained knee -- but no
structural damage. Mora listed James as questionable, meaning there's a
50-50 chance he would play Nov. 4 against the Bills. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Horn will have another disappointing game this week. Rams CB Aeneas
Williams will probably draw him in coverage and nuetralize him for long
periods.

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Brooks won't post huge yardage totals against the Rams. The St. Louis
secondary will use its good speed to take away the deep pass.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Davis won't be a major factor against the Giants. New York will look to
stuff the run early on, and will force Tony Banks to the air, as the
Giants' defense dictates the flow of the game.

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Holt should have a good second half against the Saints. He should
eventually wear CB Fred Thomas out, and Holt will be a key receiver late in
the game.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Canidate will start in place of the injured Marshall Faulk again this week.
His numbers won't be overwhelming against the solid Saints defense.

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Warner is always a good start, but he may feel some extra pressure this
week. New Orleans' front seven will try to disrupt his timing as often as
possible.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Ismail has developed into a good all-around receiver. He is definitely
worth a start against the inconsistent Jaguars secondary.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Taylor has been inconsistent this year, yet he has a good matchup this
week. Jacksonville's pass defense is erratic and may let Taylor get in the
end zone for a score.

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Walls will get a lot of important looks this week. The Panthers should move
the ball rather well against the Jets, and Walls may be open for TD catches
near the goal line.

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Hayes will definitely be a TD threat this week. The Jets' defense gives up
a lot of yardage, and Hayes will certainly get chances to score in the red
zone.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Muhammad should have a good game againt the Jets. New York's defense is
definitely vulnerable to big-play wideouts.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should be good for at least one TD this week. The Patriots should
move the ball well against Denver.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brady may have another good game this week. Denver's pass defense is very
vulnerable, and Brady is looking good at the helm of the New England
offense.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Gannon will have trouble moving the ball against a tough Eagles defense but
should still find a way to score a touchdown. Look for him to either throw
a TD pass or get a rushing score. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Rice will catch some passes this week but don't expect him to score a
touchdown. The Eagles have one of the top pass defenses in the NFL and have
only allowed five TD passes all season. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brown faces a formidable Eagles secondary but should have a good game. He
has done well against NFC opponents recently. Brown has 20 receptions and
three touchdowns in his last four games against the NFC. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Howard will have a major role in the passing attack now that receivers
Herman Moore and Germane Crowell are out for the season. Howard might not
catch a lot of passes this week but should score a touchdown. He has
exceptional breakaway speed. We still wouldn't advise starting him yet.
Howard must first prove that he can be a reliable wideout.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Stewart is expected to play on Sunday. His ankle injury was originally
diagnosed as a sprain, but is now being classified as a bruise. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Morton should have a solid game against the Bengals this week. The
Cincinnati secondary has been adequate at best this season and has given up
eight touchdown passes.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Martin had scored a touchdown in each of his first five games until the
Jets shut him out Sunday. Look for Martin to rebound and have a good game
this week against the Panthers. Carolina has one of the worst run defenses
in the NFL. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Coles will be the primary receiver this week, replacing the injured Wayne
Chrebet. Coles has played well in recent weeks. Expect him to catch a lot
of passes and score a touchdown. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Robinson won't challenge the Miami secondary this week. The rookie receiver
has been a Fantasy disappointment so far.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Brunell has been an adequate starter but will have a tough matchup against
the Ravens. Baltimore has struggled against the pass in recent weeks but we
wouldn't advise using Brunell. He doesn't have enough talent at receiver to
post good numbers against Baltimore. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Jackson won't do much against the Dolphins. CB Sam Madison will keep him
quiet throughout Sunday's game.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Alexander may have his first disappointing outing of the year. Miami's
defense will be geared to stopping the run, and will strive to contain
Alexander and force Matt Hasselbeck to throw often.

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
McCardell struggled in the first few games as he made his way back from
injury, but has begun to look like his old self in the previous game.
Expect McCardell to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Stewart may throw a TD pass against the vulnerable Tennessee secondary, but
he may also see a lot of blitzes. Turnovers and rushed passes may hurt his
overall numbers.

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Brady has been a disappointment so far this season. He didn't have high
expectations coming into the season, but many expected him to have more
than the eight receptions and a touchdown this season. Don't expect him to
be productive this week. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Mason has been a disappointment so far because of injuries. He might get
deep once or twice against Pittsburgh, but his overall numbers won't be
impressive.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Look for Smith to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He has struggled to
score in recent games. Smith has caught a lot of passes this season but
hasn't had a touchdown since Week One. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Chamberlain won't have a very productive day against the Buccaneers. He
won't see a lot of receiving room over the middle.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Carter should be good for at least one TD catch against Tampa Bay. He will
give CB Donnie Abraham a lot of trouble.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Culpepper might have to carry the offense against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers
will crack down on the run early, and Culpepper will have to scramble or
throw into tight coverages. He may turn the ball over more than once.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Barber will likely be used mostly on third downs. He has taken a lesser
role in the running game this season and is not worth starting right now. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Expect Dayne to have a big game this week against the Redskins. Washington
has one of the worst run defenses in football. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season but should throw at least one
touchdown pass this week against the Redskins. Washington has one of the
worst defenses in the NFL. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Staley is recovering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Raiders, despite being listed as probable. Don't
expect him to gain a lot of yards. The Raiders have one of the best run
defenses.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Expect McNabb to have another good game this week. The Raiders have had
trouble containing mobile quarterbacks in the past few years. McNabb should
score with either a touchdown run or pass. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Lewis should catch an adequate amount of passes this week. The Raiders will
have good coverage on the Philadelphia receivers but Lewis will manage to
slip through the coverage. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Thrash to be too productive this week. He has been
inconsistent this season and faces one of the top secondaries. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
managed to practice Thursday after sitting out Wednesday's practice. Look
for Pinkston to be an adequate second Fantasy receiver this week. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Smith has a leg injury but is expected to play this week. He is listed as
probable on the injury report. Expect Smith to overcome his injury and be a
solid Fantasy back this week. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Fiedler has thrown a decent amount of TD passes this season, but he has
also thrown a lot of interceptions. Look for him to throw a TD pass and at
least one interception this week. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
McKnight has been inconsistent this season but should catch some passes
against the Seahawks. Expect him to be an adequate No. 2 receiver for your
squad. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Gadsden should catch a few passes this week. The Seahawks have had trouble
stopping the pass this season. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should have some success against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has
allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. Expect Smith to gain at least
85 yards and score a touchdown. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Tomlinson should have a big game this week against an inadequate Buffalo
run defense. Tomlinson has been an effective runner so far while the Bills
have allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Fluite will be productive but don't expect him to throw a lot of touchdown
passes Sunday against the Bills. San Diego will have so much success
running the ball that they won't need Flutie to throw. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Conway to be too productive this week. He has been mediocre as
the Chargers' primary receiver scoring two touchdowns and catching 20
passes in six games. He will be a good No. 2 receiver at best. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Graham should catch some passes against the Bills this week but don't
expect him to score a touchdown. He's still not reliable enough to start on
a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Pittman had 95 yards rushing last week against the Chiefs. The Cowboys'
defense is a bit tougher than the Chiefs, but Pittman should still be
productive. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Plummer has been an adequate passer all season. He should continue that
trend this week against the Cowboys, who have a mediocre pass rush. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Sanders has struggled this season but should play better against Dallas
this week. The Arizona offensive line will give QB Jake Plummer good
protection and allow Sanders a lot of time to get open. Expect him to catch
some passes and score a touchdown. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Look for Boston to play well against the Cowboys Sunday. Dallas has an
inexperinced secondary while Boston is emerging as a premier receiver. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Expect Johnson to be accurate this week but he will probably have a hard
time throwing TD passes. Johnson has played better in recent weeks but his
top two receivers are suffering from injuries. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Anderson has struggled lately but should rebound against the Patriots this
week. Expect him to gain at least 80 yards this week and run for a
touchdown. The Patriots have given up five rushing TDs this season. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Griese is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Patriots because
of a lingering shoulder injury. Look for him to play through the injury and
throw at least one touchdown pass. Griese won't dominate but he will be a
solid starting QB this week. 

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Kennison to do well this week. He only has 13 catches and a
touchdown in five starts this season.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Dillon was limited to just 30 yards rushing by the Bears last week but
should be more productive this week. He is facing a Lions defense that has
allowed an average of 131.8 yards in five games. Look for Dillon to gain a
good amount of yards and score a touchdown. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Kitna failed to throw a TD pass last week but expect him to toss a few
against the Lions this week. Detroit has given up 10 TD passes in five
games this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Warrick should catch a lot of passes this week but don't expect him to
score a touchdown. He has just one TD reception in six games.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Scott has struggled this season, but look for him to catch some passes this
week against a struggling Lions secondary. He should be an adequate No. 3
wideout this week in leagues that start three receivers. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Terrell had a breakthrough performance last week catching a season-high
seven passes for 91 yards. Look for him to continue to catch passes this
week against the 49ers and possibly score his first touchdown. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Miller's pass protection will give him an adequate amount of time to throw
the ball this week against the mediocre San Francisco pass rush. Look for
Miller to unleash passes all over the field and accumulate Fantasy points. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Booker should once again be a good starting receiver this week. He is the
Bears' top receiving option now that Marcus Robinson is out for the season
and faces a 49ers defense that has allowed six TD receptions in five games. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Garcia will find it difficult to move the ball against the Bears' defense
but he should still find a way to be productive. Look for him to score a
touchdown either by running it in or throwing the ball.

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Hearst has been effective this season, but not very explosive. Look for him
to struggle against the stingy Bears defense this week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Owens set the record for most receptions in a game the last time he played
the Bears. He won't be as effective this week, but will be a productive
receiver. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Stokes has been nursing sore legs and might not be at full strength for
Sunday's game. He has struggled when healthy so don't expect him to score a
lot of points this week.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Henry should be able to gain between 70-90 yards against the Chargers but
he will have a tough time scoring a touchdown. San Diego has only allowed
two rushing TDs this season. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Johnson has not thrown a lot of TD passes this season, totaling just three
in five games. It will be difficult for him to throw the ball effectively
against the Chargers so don't rely on him for a lot of Fantasy points.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Look for Centers to have a big game this season. He is the Bills leading
receiver this season with 35 receptions. Expect him to catch a lot of
passes this week and be a solid No. 2 back. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Price to be too productive this week. He only has nine catches
this season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Riemersma should catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score
a TD. He lacks the speed to break away for a long reception and hasn't been
getting too many looks inside the red zone. 

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Moulds suffered a minor leg injury in practice Thursday but is expected to
play Sunday. Look for Moulds to catch several passes and score a touchdown.
He has caught a TD pass in each of the last two games. 

Terry Kirby, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Kirby might be activated for the first time this season, according to
<i>The Contra Costa Times</i>. The Raiders plan to use him if Tyrone
Wheatley is unable to play. But don't expect Kirby to get a lot of touches.
Oakland will likely rely on Charlie Garner instead. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Wheatley missed practice again on Thursday because of wrist and knee
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Terry Kirby will
replace him in the rotation if he is unable to play. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Jones, recovering from a shoulder injury, returned to practice Thursday. He
might remains questionable for this week's game but might see some action. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Sharpe has been downgraded on the injury report from probable to
questionable. He has been limited in practice all week because of a leg
injury. Rookie Todd Heap might get a lot of looks on offense but he is also
recovering from injury. The Ravens may be forced to use tight end John
Jones. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Wilkins missed Thursday's game at Kansas City. He was held out of the
lineup because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Pathon missed his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. He was replaced by rookie Reggie Wayne in the starting
lineup. 

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
It doesn't appear that Bledsoe will be used as an emergency QB Sunday, but
<i>The Boston Herald</i> reports that doctors will make a decision on
whether on not to increase his workload. Bledsoe has thrown 75 passes in
the past two days without experiencing any adverse affects. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Joseph might replace Stacey Mack as the starting back this Sunday,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. Mack has made two critical
mistakes in the past two games. Joseph has been getting a lot of carries
this week and has already been slated to be the third-down back. We
wouldn't advise using either player this week if you already have two solid
backs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Mack might be replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Elvis Joseph,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. The Jaguars are reportedly
looking to use Joseph because of the mistakes Mack has made in the past two
games. Consider reserving Mack this week. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Galloway was limited in practice once again Thursday because of a foot
injury. <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> reports that he will be a gametime
decision. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Swinton practiced Thursday an is expected to play Sunday, according to
<i>The Dallas Morning News</i>. Swinton had been limited for most of the
week because of a hamstring injury. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Bennett to return to the starting lineup soon. He is listed as
questionable on the injury report but probably won't return until after the
Vikings' bye in Week Eight. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Green was limited in practice Thursday because of a groin injury. He
remains questionable for Sunday's game and will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Dunn was limited in practice Thursday because of his hamstring injury and
remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Johnson was upgraded from questionable to probable Thursday. He is
suffering from hip and thigh injuries but was able to run for the second
consecutive day. Johnson is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Ward (ankle) was limited in practice Thursday, according to <i>The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>. He is still expected to play in Monday's game
against Tennessee. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
The Patriots will reportedly bench Glenn once again this week if he doesn't
show any improvement in practice Friday. Glenn is suffering from a
hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Smith is listed as probable on the injury report. He is suffering from an
ankle injury but is expected to start Sunday's game against New England. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Weinke is suffering from a hip injury but is expected to start Sunday's
game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Matthews is suffering from sore ribs but is expected to be the No. 2 QB
Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but was too sore to work out Thursday. He remains
questionable for Sunday's game but <i>The Washington Post</i> claims that
it is almost certain Allen will be replaced by Jason Brookins. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Not only is Wright out for the season, he might need season-ending surgery
to repair his damaged knee. An MRI showed that he damaged the same ACL that
was repaired in five years ago. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Head coach Mike Martz has ruled Faulk out for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. Faulk is still recovering from a
bruised knee so Trung Canidate will replace him as the starting running
back once again.
