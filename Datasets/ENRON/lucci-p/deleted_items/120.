Joe Nedney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01

Erron Kinney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson!  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12753&>, RB! J! AC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10! /! 23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular se! as! on game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in! W! eek Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in," Bucs Head Coac! h ! Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times . "Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

Brett Favre <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. "It'll be OK," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help."

James Stewart <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1116&>, RB DE! T! - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
