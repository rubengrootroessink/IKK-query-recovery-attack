OK that whole bra comment...MEAN!  You know I'm sensitive about my little breasts!  I've been working on the girls about the limo.  I think they're coming around.  It would be much less expensive to go the limo way in my opinion.  Plus, I'm not crazy about running around in the cold since I  won't be wearing much!

What parties are you going to.  I've got two parties and a band I want tos ee.  Cabs are too expensive.  Figure out where you guys want to go and then let's talk.  What are you going as, hopefully cat woman in as kin-tight cat suit.  So you better pad your bra!

Update!  Jeff the DUI guy wants to party, so no go on the driving.  Like I guessed, Nat and Lorena are going to pass on the limo.  So, taxi is probably the best bet.  We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to "get ready" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?
