Sean,

I am hoping you can make a similar change to the included deal number.  I have yet to hear from Paul on this deal.  Can you confirm the correct counterparty as CMS Field Services?

Thanks,
Scott

Paul,

We have the above Sep-01 production deal on WIC pipeline in the system under CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company.  However, the counterparty is billing us under CMS Field Services, Inc.  These two counterparties settle differently.  Please confirm the correct counterparty name if possible.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
