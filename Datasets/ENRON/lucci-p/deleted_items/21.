Paul,

Just thought that I would let you know that the Red Rock deal which we were discussing yesterday does have an offsetting deal with OneOK, the supplier correct?  Anyways, the P&L impact on those two deals taken together is 0.  So, I am still looking into finding an offsetting Burlington Wic deal for Grigsby's WIC position.
