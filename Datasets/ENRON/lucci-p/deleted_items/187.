I DO like to go out on Halloween.  Maybe we can all hook up.  Do you guys dress up?  I'm out for the rest of the day.  My boss is riding with me for the day.  Talk to you later.

We got crazy at Cool River.  Smokin Cigars, drinking heavily...there was even a little spanking going on!  You missed it, man.  Still up in the air about Halloween.  What's the fun single thing to do?

This is the beginning of the busy season for my industry, so things have been hoppin at work.  Celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend.  Very fun!  Been wanting to get some golfing in before it gets too cold.  What about you?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.
