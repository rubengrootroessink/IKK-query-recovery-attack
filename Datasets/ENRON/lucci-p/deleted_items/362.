Mike I think this deal makes alot of since for producers in the San Juan.  It gives you exposure to California Border pricing, firm takes, the Right of First Refusal in 2006 and the ability to sell at the wellhead.  We are flexible on the volumes, I chose 30 MM/d as an example.

Take a look at it and let me know what you think.

P.S. Thanks for the Winter business!

Mark
