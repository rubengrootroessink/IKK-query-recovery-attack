Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. Consider
reserving Pathon this week. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. "It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,"
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. "People don't know how bad
this is hurting." The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is expected to miss two weeks due to a hamstring injury. Anthony
Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much Fantasy value
at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. "I said it before and I'll say it
again," Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. "Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback." Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. "It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it," Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. "People
don't know how bad this is hurting." Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Alexander rushed for 176 yards on 31 carries and scored two TDs against
Jacksonville. He will continue to be a good Fantasy starter while Ricky
Watters is out, and Alexander seems to be more of a TD threat than Watters
can be right now.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Mack was benched at Seattle on Sunday in the second quarter after rushing
for only 17 yards on eight carries. On his final attempt of the day, he
lost a fumble, and was replaced by rookie Elvis Joseph. The first-year back
rushed for only 39 yards and fumbled as well, but he caught an 18-yard TD
pass. Now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game
at RB for the Jaguars if Fred Taylor is not ready to return from a groin
injury after the bye week.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Wheatley scored two TDs against Dallas on Sunday. His rushing totals (33
yards) were modest, however, and it's still tough to start him on a weekly
basis due to the presence of Charlie Garner. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught seven passes for 114 yards in Oakland's win over Dallas. He
continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Dallas tried to open up their offense against Oakland, and Galloway's
numbers improved slightly as a result. He had his best game of the season,
posting 59 yards receiving and a TD. Those are modest numbers, however, so
don't think of starting him on a weekly basis. 

Aaron Stecker, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against Green Bay. He does
not appear to be a viable option for the Buccaneers while Warrick Dunn is
out. Tampa Bay apparently still has faith in Mike Alstott.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith was held in check once again, posting only 46 yards of total offense
against Oakland. Without an effective passing game, Smith is going to have
a long season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Wright took over at QB for Dallas after Quincy Carter left in the first
quarter with a strained hamstring. He completed 14-of-22 for 126 yards and
two TDs against Oakland, but still has very little value as a Fantasy
player. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/07/01
Alstott rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries and a TD against the Packers. The
big fullback proved he can still be a dependable Fantasy RB.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Wycheck left Sunday's game against Baltimore with a neck strain. He did not
return to the game, and will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards at Tampa Bay. With the emergence
of Bill Schroeder, Freeman has become the less desirable option of Green
Bay's starting wideouts.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Gary carried the ball only nine times for 28 yards in Denver's 20-6 win
over Kansas City. He may have slipped to No. 2 on the depth chart behind
Mike Anderson. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson posted 155 yards rushing and a score against Kansas City on
Sunday. He received much more of the workload in the Denver backfield than
Olandis Gary, and may be emerging as the team's No. 1 back. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 119 yards and a TD at Tampa Bay. The Green
Bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense, proving he has
indeed become a quality Fantasy player.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Smith had another huge outing, posting eight receptions for 110 yards and a
score against Kansas City. Smith is establishing himself as one of the best
wideouts in the league this season, and should be in your starting lineup
on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Griese struggled for the second consecutive week, posting only 121 yards
passing and a TD against Kansas City. Griese's numbers are being hurt
somewhat by the loss of Ed McCaffrey, but he still warrants a weekly
starting spot in most leagues Fantasy-wise.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Holmes put up decent numbers against Denver, posting seven receptions and
100 yards of total offense. He's not worthy of a starting spot every week,
but he could be useful when the matchup is right. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Green came back to earth after a solid performance last weekend against
Washington. Green was picked off four times by the Denver defense and was
held without a TD pass in the Chiefs' 20-6 loss. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Johnson left Sunday's game vs. Green Bay for a brief period in the third
quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. He returned to the game after an
examination on the sidelines.

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 71 yards on 17 carries against the Bears. Smith lacks the
speed and burst to be a solid Fantasy RB for the rest of the year. Don't
count on him as anything more than a reserve, despite the respectable look
of his final Week Four numbers.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Robinson caught nine passes for 114 yards and a TD against the Falcons.
Robinson has reclaimed his spot among Fantasy Football's top wideouts now
that he is healthy again.

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Jenkins caught six passes for 119 yards and a TD against the Eagles. Don't
expect such totals from Jenkins on a regular basis. He might draw more
defensive attention in the coming weeks, and has never proved he can put up
good numbers in the past.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Pinkston caught four passes for 90 yards and two TDs against the Cardinals.
The young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality Fantasy player because
of his good hands, concentration and leaping ability.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Buckhalter rushed for 134 yards on 21 carries against Arizona. The rookie
has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the
injured Duce Staley.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Plummer threw for 238 yards, two TDs and an interception in a win over
Philadelphia. His respectable performance against the Eagles' strong
defense should convince many Fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a
backup.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Fiedler threw for only 87 yards and a TD and was intercepted once by the
Patriots. Don't depend on Fiedler for quality Fantasy numbers on a weekly
basis.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
McKnight caught two passes for just 17 yards against the Patriots. The
veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable Fantasy production.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught five passes for 47 yards at Miami. His numbers may suffer
until Drew Bledsoe is healthy again. Tom Brady does not have the arm
strength to take advantage of Brown's deep gears on a regular basis.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Minnis (concussion) was in the starting lineup for Kansas City on Sunday.
He was originally listed as questionable for the game, but was able to go.
The rookie posted five receptions for 56 yards in the game. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 47 yards and a TD at Miami. While he may not post
consistently good yardage numbers the rest of the year, Smith will continue
to be a TD threat.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Johnson was taken to the locker room in the first half of Sunday's game
with a pinched nerve in his neck. He was replaced by Alex Van Pelt and did
not return.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson has received most of the carries in the first half of Sunday's
game against Kansas City. In fact, he has already rushed for 106 yards and
a score midway through the first half. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Carter left Sunday's game against Oakland in the first quarter due to a
strained left hamstring. He did not return to the game, and will be
re-evaluared on Monday. Anthony Wright replaced the rookie QB in the lineup
for Dallas. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Taylor had his second consecutive good outing on Sunday, posting five
receptions and a touchdown in Baltimore's 26-7 victory over Tennessee. If
he continues to produce, Taylor may warrant a starting role from a Fantasy
perspective on a more regular basis. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Warrick caught four passes for just 39 yards against the Steelers. Jon
Kitna has been working more exclusively with Darnay Scott, and Warrick
hasn't put up good Fantasy numbers yet this season.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brookins saw an increase in his carries on Sunday against Tennessee, and
his numbers really reflected it. He posted 68 yards and a touchdown in
Baltimore's 26-7 victory, and could see more playing time in the Ravens'
offense from now on. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Ward caught eight passes 68 yards against the Bengals. He continues to be
Pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver, and now qualifies as a solid
Fantasy reserve.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Allen finally had a productive game, posting 108 yards rushing and a
touchdown against Tennessee. However, he still isn't a player that Fantasy
owners should depend on for consistent production. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Kinney had a solid game against Baltimore, posting seven catches for 75
yards. He is putting a dent into Frank Wycheck's numbers early in the year,
and will likely play a more prominent role in the Titans' offense this
season. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Bettis rushed for 153 yards on 24 carries against Cincinnati. He will
continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective, but the
Pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Despite a slight shoulder injury, Williams was impressive on Sunday against
Minnesota. He posted 178 yards of total offense and a touchdown in the
Saints' 28-15 win. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Jackson led New Orleans with six catches for 95 yards against Minnesota on
Sunday. He has become QB Aaron Brooks' favorite target and is slowly
becoming a more consistent Fantasy player. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Bennett was held in check once again, posting only 36 yards of total
offense against New Orleans. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may
want to consider dropping Bennett altogether. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Brunell started Sunday's game at Seattle. He had been listed as
questionable with recurring headaches.

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Washington was impressive after replacing the injured Ron Dayne on Sunday,
posting 106 scrimmage yards against the Redskins. He did fumbled twice,
however, and probably won't get the opportunity to see extensive playing
time again unless both Dayne and Tiki Barber are unable to go next week. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Chandler sustained a mild concussion in the second quarter of Sunday's game
against the Chicago Bears. Michael Vick played the entire second half at QB
for Atlanta.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Davis had another rough outing, posting just 39 yards rushing on Sunday
against the N.Y. Giants. With Washington's offense struggling, Fantasy
owners may want to consider dealing Davis within the next few weeks. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Banks was horrible against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only
151 yards and two interceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a
roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Johnson fractured his clavicle during Sunday's game against Tennessee. He
will likely miss a few weeks of action due to the injury. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Jackson (ribs) was in the starting lineup for Cleveland on Sunday. He
rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown in the Browns' 20-16 victory over San
Diego. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Tomlinson had another huge game, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown
against Cleveland. The rookie from TCU is quickly becoming one of the best
RBs in the entire league, and is worthy of a starting spot on your Fantasy
team on weekly basis. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
George left Sunday's game against Baltimore in the second half due an ankle
injury. He was replaced in the backfield by Mike Green. George did not
return to the game, but he was seen testing the ankle on the sidelines and
will likely be available for next week's game against Tampa Bay. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Vick opened the second half at QB for Atlanta. Chris Chandler left the game
against Chicago with a concussion.
