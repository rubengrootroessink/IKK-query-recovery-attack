We are sorry to hear that you have experienced difficulties signing             
into our website.                                                               
                                                                                
Please follow the steps below for a successful log in.                          
                                                                                
1) Go to our website at http://www.bmgmusicservice.com.                         
                                                                                
2) If you are a member visiting our site for the first time, click on           
the "Members visiting for the first time" link.  If you have visited            
the site previously, click on the "I forgot my Password" link.                  
                                                                                
3) Submit the requested information exactly as shown:                           
                                                                                
              Account Number: 8570262256           Zip Code: 80020              
                                                                                
Please note that your account number contains only ten digits.  Your            
account number may have additional numbers or letters following it when         
it is printed on Club correspondence.  Any extra characters should be           
disregarded, as they are for use in our office only.  Also, if you have         
moved recently, you should try to log in with your previous Zip Code            
first.                                                                          
                                                                                
4) If you are a first time member and wish to use a Member Name and             
Password, fill in the required information and click on "Enter."                
(Please remember that the Member Name and Password are case-sensitive.)         
                                                                                
New website users cannot sign on to the site as a member for the first          
time when the Real Time Link (which verifies account information) is            
down around 1:00 AM Monday - Saturday and from 4:30 PM - 8:30 PM                
Sunday.  Therefore, if you are not yet a registered website user, it            
will be necessary to enter as a guest during these hours.                       
                                                                                
If you continue to experience problems, please let us know.  When               
corresponding with us, it is important to include your account number           
or full name and complete mailing address.  Also, be sure to include a          
detailed description of the problem you are experiencing.                       
                                                                                
We hope this information has been helpful.
