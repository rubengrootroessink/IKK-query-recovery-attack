Dear Colleague,

GasTrader would like to offer you a  COMPLIMENTARY trial subscription to 
GasTrader - the only natural gas industry publication that deals with today's 
critical issue of where natural gas prices are headed, and not where they 
have been. 

GasTrader features weekly analysis and commentary from the industry's leading 
forecasters, observers, and traders.

GasTrader brings you short and long term weather predictions, useful for 
planning load and power requirements, as well as price trends, market 
outlook, and economic analysis. 

In addition GasTrader in its' Market Outlook section brings you no-nonsense 
trading recommendations for the wild and volatile natural gas futures. A key 
feature for those doing deals tied to the Nymex futures contract.

Check out GasTrader's market recommendations from long time Commodity Trading 
Advisor and analyst Bill Burson. See if those recommendations help you do 
better deals and expand the razor thin margins so prevalent today in natural 
gas marketing.

If you would like to receive your FIVE WEEK COMPLIMENTARY SUBSCRIPTION to 
GasTrader, please vistit our website, GasTrader.net and click "subscribe" or 
reply to this e-mail and include your name, company and address and

Monday.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Bill Burson,
Editor
