Ok.....here's the deal. 

EVERYONE lost this week which means we all split 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
money. ($740 divided by 13)

We have a couple of options. 

1.  Receive $56.92 now.  (Maybe Bob W. will throw in the extra 8 cents for
everyone so we can round our winnings up to $57.00).  Game over.
2.  Let everything ride.  No coming back to collect later though!  This also
means that the pot of dollars will be smaller by the number of players
electing to take their winnings now. 

Please let me know your intentions by noon tomorrow:  Roll the dice and
continue to play or collect your money now.  

Thanks,
Larry Bevans
