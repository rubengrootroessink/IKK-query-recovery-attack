Quick question...in regards to this EJW Family deal that I just received across the fax....there is a note that says "Please enter 92 mmbtu/day @ GDP-CIG/RKYMTN.  Do I need to enter this as an additional deal?   Let me know.  I need to book this deal before 4 p.m.  Thank you!

Carole

Paul,

I will definitely do some more investigative work on this.  I need to load our curves right now.  Can I get back to you about this tomorrow?  I am pretty swamped today.  Thanks.

Please look these over to see if these are all the fixed price financial deals Sinclair has with us.  


Thanks
