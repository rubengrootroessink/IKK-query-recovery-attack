Latest NFL Player News

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. "There are
concerns," coach Jeff Fisher said. "He hasn't responded like we'd hoped.
He's still pretty stiff." McNair first experienced some stiffness in his
lower back late last week. In the first quarter of Sunday's game against
Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened up. However, he stayed in the game
and led the Titans to a 26-20 victory. Even McNair is unsure of his status
for Saturday night. "If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do
it," he said. "I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this
time the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated." Avoid using McNair
this week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him
a major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns on Thursday put Jackson, on injured reserve. Jackson,
a rookie, who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of
the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the
first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left
the game with two carries for 6 yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. "I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes," Mike Riley. "But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "It's a
coincidence," Barlow said. "It was my turn in the rotation to be in there."
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. "We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday," Dennis Green said. "I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective."

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. "I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent," Allen said. "My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team."

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury." 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place. 

Tim Dwight, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not
produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time
in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most
Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current
status is day to day.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is
day to day. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to
play this week. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on
Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected
to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will
be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He
might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained
73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week.
Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday
against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a
groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's
playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His
health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will
likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more
work over the final three games of the season, according to the
<I>Nashville Tennessean</I>. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said.
"We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played
[Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This
development will limit George's production over the final three weeks,
making him a risky start.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back
which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is
unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he
should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next
couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against
Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear,
but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a
separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably
start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his
backup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the
remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable
weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay
and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time
the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this
week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't
reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on
the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's
strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether
Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth
starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury
Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to
reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will
probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we
don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati
after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10
carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three
after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy
starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie
Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not
expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale
against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs,
especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at
any time.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a
sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game
against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you
consider using him this week.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/18/01
Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against
Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine his true status
for the game. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past few weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Davis suffered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. "He's
sore today, but he has indicated he'll be fine," Coach Marty Schottenheimer
told the <I>Washington Post</I>. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to
start against Chicago in Week 15. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Banks will remain the Redskins'
starting quarterback. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach
Marty Schottemheimer is expected to stick with him rather than go with
backup Kent Graham. 

Frank Murphy, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Murphy suffered a severely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago.
The injury will likely keep him out of this weekend's game against New
Orleans. 

 Buccaneers, DT TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured
during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this
week, but should be available for Week 15. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Bouman strained a ligament on the palm side of the thumb during the
Vikings' 27-24 loss Sunday at Detroit. He will be listed as probable for
Week 15, but Bouman said he isn't sure he'll be ready in time for Sunday's
game vs. Jacksonville. Third-stringer Spergon Wynn would get the start if
Bouman is unable to play. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star Tribune</I>, Culpepper will have
surgery on his left knee this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. There
is an outside chance that he could play in Minnesota's season finale
against Baltimore, but that seems unlikely at this point. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Franks suffered a mild ankle sprain during Sunday's loss to Tennessee. The
injury isn't serious, however, so Franks will be in the starting lineup in
Week 15 against Cleveland. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Foster suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Minnesota. The
extent of the injury is still unclear, so the team doesn't expect to know
his status for Week 15 until Wednesday. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/18/01
Stewart suffered a slight hip pointer during Sunday's game against
Minnesota. The injury isn't considered serious, so look for Stewart to be
in the starting lineup on Sunday against Pittsburgh. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/18/01
Walls missed practice on Monday due to an ankle injury. However, Head Coach
George Seifert expects his veteran tight end to be available for Sunday's
game against St. Louis. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Muhammad is dealing with a slight case of turf toe, which caused him to
miss practice on Monday. However, Coach George Seifert expects his veteran
wideout to start this weekend against St. Louis. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Jenkins suffered a sprained ankle in the second half of Saturday's game
against the N.Y. Giants. He was still very sore on Monday, so his status
for Sunday's game vs. Dallas won't be known until later in the week. 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage
in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday
against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick
Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the
team's placekicker. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
Price's ankle is still stiff and sore. Head coach Gregg Williams will
evaluate him on a daily basis, according to published reports. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he shouldn't miss his
next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed no broken bones.
Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some practice before
Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the quarterback to
play. 

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 12/17/01
Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season by the
team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major
disappointment for Fantasy leaguers this year. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man
in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in
the team's final three games. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle
coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren
said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide
whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said.
The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time
of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status
is day to day. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is
day to day.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher
has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some
carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to
day.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day
to day. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing
time. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any
playing time. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not
believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for
the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is
expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated
shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of
the year. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for
Week 15.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his
hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the
severity of his injured right knee. "It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not
sure what's going to happen," Henry said. "It's a part of football. It was
an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went.
Hopefully, it's not too serious." 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and
might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right
now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a
banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the
Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the
team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is
moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from
Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing
yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a
poor performance. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against
Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of
starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks? numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no
touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn?t reliable enough to
be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be
one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and
two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will
be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured
Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in
the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when
Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12
carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries,
but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.
