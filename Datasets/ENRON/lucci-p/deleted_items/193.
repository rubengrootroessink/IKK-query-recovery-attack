Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But
the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore.
Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this
week.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once
again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New
England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this
week.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the
second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in
your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned
Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against
New England.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was
intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against
them at home this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle.
He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green
Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether
he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving
treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding
whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might
have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff
didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts
this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in
his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good
week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky
start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his
downfield speed.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets
will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but
he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible
offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting
Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18
passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't
even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a
decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers
in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can
be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first
interception of the year.

Walter Rasby, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen
Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at
this point. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary
on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the
questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this
season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more
reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back
this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams'
offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the
majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid
will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the
more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth
starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and
around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this
season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit
suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley
will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for
Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on
Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a
consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout
unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been
relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix,
we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have
a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth
starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Barber (hamstring) is listed as probable for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. He'll be used in the same capacity he was prior to the
injury, splitting time with Ron Dayne. We'd avoid using Barber if possible
as a result, especially in smaller leagues. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Richardson (shoulder) has returned to practice, and is expected to play
against Arizona. He might take away some carries from Priest Holmes, but
Holmes has clearly become Kansas City's top ground option.

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his numbers against
Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best option
Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterback. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Minnis has been replaced in Kansas City's starting lineup by Chris Thomas.
The rookie wideout has been having trouble with his route running and
communication with QB Trent Green.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Hilliard will continue his role as the Giants' third receiver on Monday
against Philadelphia. His decreased playing time makes it tough to
recommend starting him, but don't be surprised if Hilliard finds the end
zone against the Eagles. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Toomer will face a tough matchup on Monday night, facing CB Bobby Taylor
and the aggressive Philadelphia secondary. He's worth starting in deeper
leagues, however, but you may want to sit him should you have the advantage
of a deep group of wideouts. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Williams is silencing his critics this season and has established himself
as a top Fantasy back. He's a must-start every week Fantasy-wise,
especially against lesser defenses like Atlanta. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against
the pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Pathon (foot) did not practice on Wednesday. He is not expected to play
against New England, and Reggie Wayne will probably start in his place for
the second consecutive week.

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary
is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble putting up solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Jackson had a down week against Carolina, but don't be surprised to see him
bounce back against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary is one of the league's
worst, and is easily vulnerable to a big game. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Biakabutuka will be Carolina's starting tailback this weekend against
Washington. Based on the matchup, Biakabutuka is well worth starting
Fantasy-wise against a horrible Redskins' run defense. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league
Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start
against Washington. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Vick will backup Chris Chandler this weekend, and whether or not he gets
some looks in certain situations is in question. In any event, he's not
worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Smith could have a tough time against New Orleans' tough run defense on
Sunday. He should be good for a touchdown, however, but don't expect big
yardage numbers. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Chandler is quietly have a solid season, and has once again become a
productive Fantasy player. He's had some success in the past against New
Orleans, and is worth starting this week Fantasy-wise. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Martin (shoulder) is listed as out for Sunday's game against New Orleans.
His return to action is still unclear at this time, so keep him on reserve
if he's on your roster. 

Thomas Jones, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Jones will continue his backup role this weekend against Kansas City. He
doesn't get enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration,
so avoid using him. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Pittman seems to be okay after sustaining a concussion last weekend. He's
expected to start against Kansas City, and is worth considering
Fantasy-wise due to the Chiefs' vulnerable run defense. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Plummer has put up decent numbers over the first five weeks of the season,
but he's still throwing far too many interceptions. Kansas City has a solid
pass defense, so try to avoid using Plummer if at all possible. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Sanders scored his first touchdown of the year against Chicago last
weekend, but he's not a very reliable Fantasy player. Avoid using him
outside of deeper leagues. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Hardy has done nothing since catching two touchdowns in the first two weeks
of the season. He's unreliable Fantasy-wise, and should be used as a last
resort only. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Boston continues to be a reliable Fantasy player, and he'll produce good
numbers this weekend against Kansas City. Unless you have a very deep group
of receivers, Boston should be in your starting lineup. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at
Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep
him inactive until he is effective in a game. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a
football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is
dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps
and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game
on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's
secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills
to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend
might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an
injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE
Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency
quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on
the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run,
throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would
just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are
sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no
timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss
the next game because of an injured right knee. "Tyrone Wheatley has a
second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"'
coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for
the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the
injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be
out four weeks. "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play
in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more
serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke
had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert
said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would
start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident
he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness
after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was
aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks
defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his
shoulder. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained
ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is
in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green
would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas
City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised
if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to
play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to
start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's
game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he
may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head
Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday
against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good
choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on
Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues
from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in
the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable
to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was
filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his
swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in
Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become
Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but
his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a
right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis
Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a
right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week,
this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes
completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB
job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup
Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head
Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend
you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to
recommend you start any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too
productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars'
previous. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked
like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well
this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of
couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in
Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is
listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only
has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his
hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is
much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We
believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the
muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes
the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with
a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to
Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the <i>Buffalo News</i> he plans to have minor surgery on both
knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not
affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved
in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy
again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but
he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the
Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would
start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Miami Herald</i> says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he
had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will
return.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning Star</I>, Smith could end up splitting
more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo
believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move
will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which
revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action
due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is
expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against
Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 

Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on
his right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the
<I>Contra Costa Times</I>. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of
that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The
most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in
comparison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be
healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out
for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during
Sunday's game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night
against Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should
be able to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen
has a sprained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Leaf will get his chance to
win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. "If we're going to get an
evaluation on him, this is the open window," coach Dave Campo said. "At
this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than the third
quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity." In any event, Leaf's
value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order
to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his
status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Swinton (hamstring) will not practice this week in order to rest his
injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for
the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Thomas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is now
expected to miss the remainder of the season. Thomas has no real Fantasy
value at this point.
