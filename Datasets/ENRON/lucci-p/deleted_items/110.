Robert,

I have forwarded this email on to Gerald he has passed it on to the contracts folks.  I think we should get a response back ASAP.  And hopefully the contracts will be sent out this week.  I'll keep you posted, notify me if you receive them.

Paul

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost
over and we still do not have any contracts executed.  Hope you can get this
thing unstruck and moving forward again.


Robert
