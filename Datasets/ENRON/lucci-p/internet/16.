Hello,

Thanks for the email.  I'll try and answer some of your questions.  I've only been using this servic since last weekend, and so far it's been a kick.  I think as long as you use it for amusement it stays fun.  I don't know really, if it starts getting weird I'll just turn it off.

I live up in Broomfield and work downtown.  I really haven't found anything worthwhile up in our area.  I spend most of my spare time downtown and elsewhere.

We'll have to meet for a drink sometime and all show you around the city!

Paul

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.
