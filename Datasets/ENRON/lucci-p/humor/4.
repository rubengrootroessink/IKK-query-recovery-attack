> really like drinking tequila." Finally the Mexican says, "I wish to drink
> tequila whenever I want, so make me piss tequila........"
> The Genie grants him his wish. When the Mexican gets home he gets a

> So, he takes a taste and it is the best tequila he has ever
> tasted.............
> The Mexican yells to his wife,"Consuelo, Consuelo, come quickly!"
> She comes running down the hall and the Mexican takes another glass

> The two drink and party all night. The next night the Mexican comes
