Ok,Y'all, Texas has given all those complainers plenty of time to get used
to the results. After seeing the whiners along the inauguration route, We
Texicans have decided that we might just take matters into our own hands.
Here is a solution:

#1: Let Al Gore become President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of
Texas.

So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic?

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it). The term "Don't mess
with
Texas," will take on a whole new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of ! Texas will
need
for the next 300 years.
Yankee states? Sorry about that.

Natural Gas - Again we have all we need and it's too bad about
those
northern states. Al Gore will figure a way to keep them warm....

Computer Industry - we currently lead the nation in producing
computer chips and communications: Small places like Texas
Instruments,
Dell Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola,
Intel,
AMD, Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas
Semiconductor,
Delphi, Nortel, Alcatel, Etc,Etc.

The list goes on and on.

Health Centers - We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the
world, and
other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going: UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
SMU,
University of Houston, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University,<B! Retc.
Ivy grows better in the south anyway.

We h! ave a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we
need
some more).

We have control of the paper industry, toilet paper, plastics,
insurance, etc.

In case of a foreign invasion; we have the Texas National Guard
and
the Texas Air National Guard. We don't have an army but since
everybody
down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammunition, we
can raise
an army in 24 hours if we need it. If the situation really gets
bad, we can
always call Department of Public Safety and ask them to send
over a couple
Texas Rangers. As a last resort we can always raise an army of
Mexicans.

We are totally self sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs and
vegetable
produce and everybody down here knows how to cook them so that
they taste
good.

Don't need any food.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic
of
Texas in good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need
a! nd don't
have.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore: Since
you
won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore
will be able to drive around in his 9 mile per gallon SUV. The
rest of the
United States will have to walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut
off
your communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your
homes
but since Mr. Gore has predicted global warming, you will not
need the gas.

Just a few notes on REAL election results:

Total Counties won by Bush: 2,434
Total Counties won by Gore: 677

Population of counties won by Bush: 143 million.
Population of counties won by Gore: 127 million

Square miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000
Square miles of country won by Gore: 580,000

States won by Bush: 29
States won by Gore: 19

And an even more remarkable finding....

Avera! ge Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush:<BR!0.1
Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore:
13.2

Researchers found one more interesting fact that might help
explain
these disparate murder rates. Gun ownership in the counties won
by Mr.
Bush is much higher than in the counties won by Mr. Gore.

Signed, A Proud and Humble Texan
