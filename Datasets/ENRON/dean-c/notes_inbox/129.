Mike,

1.  Please see attached spreadsheet.
2.  Ditto.
3.  Attached spreadsheets have some info.  I am working on more detail for 
you.
4.  I am seeking response from TPS engineering.
5.  I am seeking additional info from TPS environmental.
6.  See spreadsheets.  No duct firing.

- Frank

P.S.  On the Heat Rate Spreadsheet, look@ the 2x1 and 1x1 tabs (it is a work 
in progress).

What about the 'operational tools' you referred to that you may have on the 
shelf and can provide to me?

Frank, here is the list of operational info that I think would be
helpful to our team:

1) Ramp Rates for plant (ramp up and down)
 - zero to 139 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 140 to 230 MW
 - 231 to 280 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 281 to 460 MW

2) Heat Rate Curves
 - vs. output
 - vs. Temp. / Rel. Humidity

3) Start charge (in MMBtu) -  please define each, i.e. cold start means
plant has been down x hours
 - cold start
 - warm start
 - hot start

4) Is there a maximum number of starts per year?

5) Is there any permit limitations other than below?
 - In 1x1 must operate only between 140 MW and 230MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - In 2x1 must operate only between 280 MW and 460MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - Annual limit on run time or tons of emission?
 - What is a violation, is it any deviation or must the deviation
occur for a min. amount of time?

6) Operational limits
 - In 1x1 operates between 140 MW and 230MW approx.
 - In 2x1 operates between 280 MW and 460MW approx.
 - Any other level that can be operated?  Any duct firing?

Thanks for your assistance with these, - Mike
