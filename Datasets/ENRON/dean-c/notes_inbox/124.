Water consumption/make-up at Austin is as follows:

Water Make-up rate from the water plant into the demin tank is 120 gpm
Water Usage Rate of the plant at full load is 234.4 gpm

Therefor, when the plant is not running, the tank (300,000 gallon capacity) 
is filled at the rate of 120 gpm;
when the plant is running flat out, the net drawdown on the tank is 114.4 gpm 
(234.4-120=114.4).

If you do the math, if you start out Monday morning at 6 am and run the plant 
for 5 days a week for 15 hours a day, then come Friday evening at 9 pm, there 
will
be 44,400 gallons in the tank.  It will then take you 35.5 hours to fill the 
tank again which is Sunday at 8:30 am.  If you do the math, you could 
potentially run the plant for a full 15 hours on Saturday, but at the end of 
the day you would only have 6,240 gallons left in the tank and you could not 
fill it in time for Monday morning.

GE's performance program states that the LM6000 without water injection has a 
NOx level of about 200 ppm.  Our SCR reduces NOx about 80% (down to 5 ppm) 
WITH water injection.  WIthout water injection and starting at 200 ppm the 
SCR is probably not going to give you 80% effectiveness, but it might keep us 
under the instantaneous NOx limit set out in our permit (~100 ppm).  I will 
have to do a little more research on this one.

Based on some initial calculations that we did early on, with a constant 
pipeline pressure, heat rate improves by approximately 50 btu/kwh (HHV) for 
every 10oF of drop in ambient temperature.  When we run the plant this 
summer, we can obviously get some better data.

Hope this helps,

Eric
