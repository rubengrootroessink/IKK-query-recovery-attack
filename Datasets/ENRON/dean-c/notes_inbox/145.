Doug -- Following up on our discussion, attached is the single definition of 
ERCOT Unplanned B product currently traded on EOL.  Although a different 
transition can be arranged with EOL, they ordinarily show a 'banner' on the 
day that the product change is instituted and for a couple days afterwards, 
stating that the product definition has changed and very briefly summarizing 
the change.  Let's talk about what should be done to the definition below.  
My understanding is that new Operating Guides are not being published at or 
before the June 1 market transition.
