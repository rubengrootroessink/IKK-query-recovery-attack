I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.  I hope it wasn't because I called
you last night-although I'm sure that it didn't help.  It rained really
hard here too, but I was so tired that it didn't wake me up much.

It'll be nice to see you on Saturday.  I probably will party on Friday
too!  I can't wait!

3 and a half more days.....

Love you,
Jenn
