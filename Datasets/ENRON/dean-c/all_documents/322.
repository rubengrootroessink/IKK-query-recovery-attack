I'm sorry to hear that, but it's better to figure that out now rather than 
after you get married.

Nothing really wrong, but Jenn and I decided to go our separate ways.? I 
still talk to her, and I think she's a great girl.? Its just that something 
wasn't there.? I don't really know what my deal is, but I guess when we got 
to the same city finally, we didn't quite have the same passion anymore.
It is actually very sad.? Like I said, she is a great girl, and I still 
care about her a lot.? She is in Laredo right now for work, and I think we 
are going to Galveston together on Sunday.

I'm still on a leave of absence.? I will probably go back to work in August 
or September.

I had a feeling something was wrong because we hadn't heard from you in so 
long. 

I hope to talk to you soon. 




Monica :-)
