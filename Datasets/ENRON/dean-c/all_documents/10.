Part 3 of 3

Offensive Line Coach Interview

Offensive line coach Tim Nunez says he went into spring football with twin
goals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac=
e
All-American Leonard Davis, who was the second player chosen in the first
round of the NFL draft Saturday.
In an interview last week, he told me he is pleased about the progress his
players made in both areas.
He said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were
outstanding this spring in every area, including run blocking.
"Mike Williams had a great spring," Nunez said. "He had as good a spring as
any offensive linemen has had since we've been here. He's really light on h=
is
feet for such a big man, and that helps him, whether he's pass blocking or
run blocking.
"Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring," he said. "That infection
he had last season really sapped his strength all season. He fought through
it and played as hard as he could, but this spring he was flying around and
doing things he couldn't do last year. He was just a different guy this
spring and he really did a good job. He and Mike really gave us a strong
right side this spring."
He said center Matt Anderson "played well this spring. He's a steady hand i=
n
there." He also said backup Jason Glynn "had a very good spring. He is real=
ly
athletic. We just need to get him some snaps."
Junior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said, "I
think Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us. He needs t=
o
have a great summer and get stronger in his upper body. He really wants to =
be
a good player and he'll work hard this summer to get there."
He said Doane "has great technique. He really knows what to do. He's just g=
ot
to get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis."
Nunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during
the spring "was that he was going against a great player. (Defensive end)
Kalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody he'll see during the season.
He's special."
But the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle. Blinn Junior
College star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t=
o
graduate in time to join the team in August, and Dockery also worked some a=
t
left tackle in the spring and did very well, Nunez said.
Two top guards missed the spring. Senior Antwan Kirk-Hughes, a two year
starter, was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa=
y
sprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills.
When they return, Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack=
le
if the need arises. He said both of them should be totally recovered in
plenty of time for the season.
How about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle?
"Bo Baker had a good spring at guard," he said. "We'll continue to work him
some at center, but he gives us another good guard. He's really fast. If we
had a race, he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen."
Nunez said players like Williams, Dockery and Kirk-Hughes have had to play
earlier than they should have, since none of them redshirted, but he said
those painful early learning experiences should pay off this year.
"Mike Williams really improved during last season," Nunez said. "He was
playing really well by the end of the season, and he carried that over into
this spring."
He said Kirk-Hughes' shoulder and Dockery's infection hampered their play
last season, but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu=
ch
better this season because of their experiences last season.
Dockery made great strides this spring, he said, adding that he expects
Kirk-Hughes to again be one of the team's top linemen when he returns with
his surgically-repaired shoulder.
Holloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to
Dockery's health problems, and Nunez said he "had to grow up during the
season. It's tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi=
s
league, but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by
the end of the season."
"I'm excited about this group," Nunez said. "They've worked hard to get
better and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas=
on
if they can stay healthy."
Head coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were
running the ball better than they have the last two seasons. Since he also
says he isn't that happy with any of the tailbacks, he obviously feels the
line is doing a better job of run blocking.
"We worked on it more this spring," Nunez said, "and I think that will pay
off this season."
One thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams
usually don't start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors, whic=
h
means they are in their fourth year.
Exceptional linemen can start earlier, but even they usually spend two year=
s
backing up before starting in their third year.
This coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over, but other than=
 a
talented bunch of seniors, the offensive line talent was pretty bare.
Even first-round draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before
the new staff switched him to the offensive line.
Texas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi=
s
season, but the coaches haven't had that luxury until now.
Why? Because, despite their great overall recruiting success, they have bee=
n
able to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the
jackpot with six in their last recruiting class.

Basketball Aide Moves Up
Rob Lanier, 32, the Longhorns' top assistant basketball coach and lead
recruiter for the last two years, was named head coach at Siena College in
Loudonville, N.Y., last week
UT head coach Rick Barnes  said he will  try to hire a new assistant soon,
adding that he plans to hire another bright young coach who is on his way u=
p
the coaching ladder.
Six of Barnes' former assistants have become college head coaches and that =
is
because he always hires a bright, young assistant on the way up who also
happens to be an outstanding recruiter.
Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns, including
most of last season's top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T. J.
Ford.
