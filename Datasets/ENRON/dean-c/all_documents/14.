Texas Women Sign Center

UT women's basketball coach Jody Conradt already had a lot of tall recruits
in her nationally ranked recruiting class, but she didn't have a true cente=
r
until last week when she won a long battle to sign 6-2 Spring Westfield
center Mercedes Williams.
Williams averaged 16 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.7 steals per game in leadin=
g
Westfield to a 33-3 record and a berth in the state Class 5A finals.
She was on the All-State team and was the Houston Chronicle's Player of the
Year.
She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play
around the basket. She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens
and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns.
"With the addition of Mercedes, we now have five newcomers who immediately
raise the overall talent level of our program," Conradt said, adding that a=
ll
five players "are considered among the very best players coming out of thei=
r
respective states."
The other four signees are:
* 6-2 forward Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., the Oklahoma Player of the Ye=
ar
* 6-2 Heather Schreiber of Windthorst,  the top player in Texas and a Parad=
e
All-American
* 5-11 guard-forward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village
* Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from
Chestermere High School  in Alberta.
The Longhorns had a top 10 recruiting class nationally before signing
Williams.

Women's Tennis in Sweet 16

The No. 13-ranked Texas women's tennis team beat No. 19 TCU, 4-1, Sunday in
Austin in the second round of the NCAA regional playoffs.
Texas, 21-8, advances to the NCAA round of 16 and will play No. 2 Duke
Thursday in Stone Mountain, Ga.
The Longhorns played Duke earlier this season, losing 4-3 in Austin.
TCU finished 21-4.

Men's Tennis Team Falls to LSU

The No. 22-ranked Longhorn men's tennis team fell to LSU, 4-2, Sunday in
Baton Rouge in the second round of the NCAA playoffs.
The Longhorns end the season 18-6, while LSU advances to the Round of 16.

Longhorn Golfers in Regional

The No. 5-ranked Longhorn golf team will compete in the NCAA Central Region=
al
Championships in Stillwater Oklahoma Thursday through Saturday.
Texas finished third in the Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore, Okla., last
weekend, shooting a 16-over par 853 to finish five strokes behind tourney
champ Tulsa.

UT Basketball Recruits Honored

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes' two recruits both ranked among the
nation's elite players at their positions.
Good national basketball ratings are hard to find, but Student Sports
Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top 25 players at each
position for a national top 125 overall.
Point guard T. J. Ford, 5-11, of Fort Bend Willowridge, ranked No. 8 at his
position and 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No. 25 among the b=
ig
guys in the middle.
Most rating services had Ford much higher, but it is a great tribute to
Wright's potential that he made the list of the top 25 centers because he
missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery.
Ford's 39-0 Willowridge team also was ranked No. 2 in the nation by Student
Sports, and the Eagles were the top-ranked public school team.
Mouth of Wilson, Va., which gives scholarships and recruits all over the
nation, was ranked No. 1, but the Warriors are an all-star team with player=
s
from several states and countries.
Ford also made the magazine's 10-man first team senior All-American list,
which was surprising since he was rated only No. 8 in the point-guard
category.
I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards. I g=
o
along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards becaus=
e
every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three poi=
nt
guards in the nation.

Evans Testing Pro Waters

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has declared himself
eligible for June 27 NBA draft.
Evans, who led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average, has not
hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesn't
elect to turn pro.
While Evans is a fine college player, he lacks great dribbling skills at th=
is
point and probably won't be drafted. He could benefit from another year und=
er
coach Rick Barnes' tutelage.

Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard

The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard.
Terrell Ross, 6-4, a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC i=
n=20
Meadville, Md, visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to
Texas, Mississippi State and Michigan State.
Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball, so he
will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he
shows up on a college campus to start classes.
He led Allegany to a 31-3 record and the National JC championship game.
He averaged only 8.9 points a game for a loaded team that features four oth=
er
Division I signees, but he hit 60% of his shots from the field and 74.3% of
his free throws. He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder.
