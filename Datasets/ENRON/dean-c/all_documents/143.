Longhorns Facing Last Breather Before Tough Stretch Run

The Longhorns need to use Saturday's game with Baylor to jump start their
offense because the Bears might be the worst team in the Big 12, but the
Horns finish the regular season with risky road trips to Texas Tech and
Kansas and then a home game with Texas A&M.
A slow start offensively in any of those last three game could be fatal,
just
like it was against Stanford and Oklahoma. The offense finally scored an
offensive touchdown in the first quarter Saturday, and it was their first
in
the first quarter since the Texas Tech game last year.
Let's hope they get out to a fast start Saturday and it carries over into
the
last three games.

Freshman TE Brock Edwards is a talented young man who should be able to
step
up and do the job now that the team's top two tight ends (Bo Scaife and
Mike
Jones) are injured, UT tight end coach Tim Brewster said Tuesday.
"We're going to expect him to step up and play well," Brewster said. "We're
not going to put any limitations on him because he's a freshman. We've told
all the freshmen who have been playing that they aren't freshmen anymore.
We'll try to do everything we would normally do with the tight end."
Coach Mack Brown said Edwards, who was a tailback his senior year in high
school, has worked hard to improve his blocking. "He's doing much better
with
hjis blocking" Brown said. "That was his problem early, because he hadn't
done it before, but he's picking it up pretty good."
Brown said Jones is out this week and for the forseeable future. He said FB
Chad Stevens worked at TE Tuesday and will continue to practice at both
positions.
With Edwards starting at TE, the Longhorns will have true freshmen starting
at their three primary pass-catching positions because Roy Williams and B.
J.
Johnson are the starting WRs. Another true freshman WR, Sloan Thomas,
caught
two touchdown passes against Missouri.
DT Marcus Tubbs appeared to be recovered from his sore shoulder, and
starting
DT Shaun Rogers said his sprained ankle is feeling much better. He was
moving
better than he has since he injured it four weeks ago.
OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes probably will start Saturday and play until and
unless
his shoulder injury flares up again, offensive coordinator Greg Davis said.
Brown also said WR Artie Ellis is questionable for the Baylor game with a
sore shin.

Former Auburn Heisman Trophy winner and former pro star Bo Jackson talked
to
the team after practice Tuesday. Brown said Jackson told the players to
make
the most of their days playing for the Longhorns because they will always
be
known as Texas Longhorns. He said Jackson still identifies with Auburn more
than the NFL.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla.,
picked
Florida State over Texas and Boston College Tuesday. The decision was
expected. . . Folks, in talking to the top recruits who are still out
there,
I think DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., is the only
out-of-state prospect left who  is a strong Longhorn lean. I also think
there
is a good chance Jakes, Galena Park North Shore's dynamic duo of TE James
Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson and Waco's super linebacker Derrick Johnson
are
all future Longhorns. I hope Tommie Harris is, too, but that one is still
up
in the air.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Some of the freshmen who are being redshirted are
impressing
the first-team guys with their work on the  scout team. Six who draw
consistent praise from the starters are LB Austin Sendlein, QB Chance Mock,
TB Sneezy Beltran, FB Will Matthews, WR Tony Jeffery and OT Lionel Garr.

My next fax will be whenever events warrant. Please note that is Fax No.
101.
I don't start a new series until Dec. 1, so it looks like I will be doing
about 110 to 120 during this 12-month series. I promise at least 99 and I
have never done less than 104. I do them when I think they are needed and a
lot have been needed this year.
