Missouri Game Set for 1:30, No TV; Baylor Game Gets TV at 11:30

After doing some on-air promos on the Texas-Missouri game, ABC opted
instead
to televise the Texas A&M-Iowa State game, so the Saturday game in Austin
between Texas and Missouri will start at 1:30 p.m. and will NOT  be
televised.
The Baylor game in Austin the following week will be televised by the Fox
Network and will begin at 11:30 a.m.
No pay per view will be available on Texas-Missouri because ABC's contract
with the Big 12 prohibits members of the Big 12 from televising a game in
the
same time frame with the ABC network game. Texas set the time at 1:30 p.m.,
which would conflict with the telecast of the A&M-Iowa State game.
The next road game is at Texas Tech on Nov. 4, and it should be televised,
but we won't know for sure until next Monday (the infamous 12-day window
the
networks require).

Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorns will fare better now
that the coaches have simplified the offense and settled on a starting
quarterback.
"When I was at North Carolina and used two quarterbacks, we had more
experienced people around them," he said. "I think we just need to simplify
as much as we can and just let them play."
He said that was the game plan at Colorado and he said that is the way the
coaches will prepare the team for the Missouri game.
Brown said he also thinks the two-back offense is better for Texas for
several reasons. He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves
the
pass protection. When teams rush eight defenders, he  said the five
linemen,
the tight end and one running back have one more rusher than there are
blockers. When two backs are there, he said there are enough people to
block
everyone, even in a maximum blitz. Oklahoma kept two backs in early against
Texas to protect Josh Heupel from the Texas rush. It obviously worked
pretty
well for the Sooners, and it worked for the Longhorns Saturday in Boulder.
It also is a better power-running formation because of the extra blocker,
he
said, adding that success in the running game causes the other team's
safeties to creep up to help stop the run. He said that causes "one-on-one
coverage on the wide receivers and also lets the tight end slip out
easier."
He said the Longhorns' running success at Colorado was a major reason for
all
the long completions to wide receivers and to TE Mike Jones having such
success.
"When you can run and pass, it creates some problems for the defense," he
said. "We plan to keep working on being able to do both."
True freshman WR B. J. Johnson went along with the simplification idea,
while
having some fun with the rerporters on hand. Johnson said when he first got
to Texas and "heard the coaches talking about cover 6 . . . I didn't even
know they had six coverages.
When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now, he said,
"I don't even know all the plays, to tell you to truth. You should see our
playbook."
He was asked if life was simpler back when he first starting playing
football. "In pee-wee ball, we might have had 10 plays, and they all
worked,"
he said. Everybody, including B. J., laughed.

BASKETBALL RECRUITING: T. J. Ford, the 5-11, 160-pound point guard at
defending state 5A champion Fort Bend Willowridge, has made his college
choice, but he won't reveal it until a  5:45 p.m. Wednesday press
conference
at Harlem Elementary School in Baytown. The Longhorns have a great shot,
but
he also has taken visits to Louisville, Memphis State and Houston and could
wind up picking one of them. The Longhorns have only two scholarships to
award this year and Chris Wright, a  6-10 center at Redwater, committed
last
year. So, if Ford comes aboard, the Longhorns would sign Wright and Ford on
November  8, the first day of the early signing period, and that would wrap
up their class.

My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant and no later than
Wednesday, October 18.
