Very suspenseful.  Yes, I was asleep when you called.  Since I had stayed up 
until 4:30 yesterday morning, I was a little tired.  I'm glad you had a good 
weekend with your family.  I'm finally done with all my travelling weekends.  
I haven't been here since Easter.  So now I'm looking for someone to go out 
with (hint, hint).

just keeping you in suspense, was i right?  10:30pm ringer off, fast asleep?  
j/j  my weekend was good.  stayed home friday (believe it or not) saturday, 
went to a graduation party, then went to a church concert, (it was really 
different, a rapping priest from Brooklyn) and then sunday me and the 
fam/grandparents/aunt and uncle all went to eat lunch....then back to church 
...that is all, was full as usual.
