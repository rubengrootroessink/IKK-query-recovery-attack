Horns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd
Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short, but spirited scrimmage
Wednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT
officials estimated at about 7,500.
With the first-team defense sitting out most of the scrimmage, the offenses
dominated most of the way. Chris Simms hit 5 of 8 passes for 144 yards,
including a 5-yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams, who
had
set up the score with a great catch of a  50-yard Simms' throw, and a
67-yard
TD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse.
The first-team offense also scored on a two-yard run by TB Victor Ike,
after
starting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a 50-yard gallop.
But QB Major Applewhite led the second-team offense to two touchdowns,
hitting 10 of 13 for 173 yards, including scoring tosses of 70 yards to the
other sensational freshman WR, B. J. Johnson, and 15 yards to senior
Brandon
Healy. Applewhite's TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and
Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit. Starting safety Greg Brown
intercepted one of Applewhite's throws on the second-team's first
possession.
Brown still wouldn't give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the
season opener next week, but did say both QBs played well. Brown also said,
"I was really pleased with the wide receivers. I thought they made some
steps
in running better routes and making the tough catches."
He also said Ike is clearly the No. 2 TB behind Mitchell at this point.
Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring, but has not been
dominating during the current practices. He also has had some nagging
injuries. Brown said Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been doing well
in practice. "Victor has been doing the best since he's been here," Brown
said. "He is doing much better without the ball (blocking) than he has in
the
past."

Defensive coordinator Carl Reese, who has nine starters back, says he is
feeling better about his new defensive ends. "I've got four guys I think
can
play," Reese said. "Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters, and
Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job. He just keeps getting
better, so he'll be the first backup for Anderson, and Cole Pittman has had
three solid scrimmages in a row, so  he'll be the guy behind Redding. I
think
all four of them will play a lot, and they're the four main ones right
now."
Thornton, a true freshman, is one of the larger DEs at about 6-3, 270, but
Reese  said he is "pretty quick out there. He gets a good rush from the
edge,
and that's what we like. He also is learning to do a better job against the
run."
He said Pittman, who was moved over from tackle to provide better run
support, "has been doing a good job against the run, and he's a pretty good
pass rusher, too. I think we'll be okay with those four guys as soon as
they
get a little more experience."

Brown said the team will have one more open practice and it will be
Thursday
at 3:30 at Denius Field. Then he plans to give the team three days off to
try
to let the players recover from the grueling two-a-day workouts. The team
will go back to work Monday to get ready for the Saturday opener at 11:30
a.m. against Louisiana-Lafayette.

INJURY UPDATE: Brown said OT Mike Williams suffered a twisted leg in the
scrimmage, but he said he didn't think it was serious.

RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorns still have 13 commitments. DE Eric Hall,
6-3, 225, 4.5, of Clarksville, Tenn., who will take his official visit to
Texas the Sept, 9 weekend, rushed 10 times for 102 yards and completed 5 of
7
passes for 106 yards and two TDs to lead his team to a 34-0 victory over
Springfield  Friday in the season opener for both teams. He plays QB and
safety, but said he didn't play any defense after the first half. . . DT
Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, says Texas is still his top team, and he
said he will come to the Louisiana-Lafayette game Dec. 9. "I really like
what
Mack Brown has been doing since he came to Texas," Harris said.
