Brown Says Horns Ready For Big Game; Nordgren Visits Practice

Coach Mack Brown said Thursday the Longhorns "have worked really hard all
week" and appear ready for the big game with Oklahoma in Dallas Saturday.
"It
has been a good week of practice," he said.
Brown also said DT Shaun Rogers (sprained ankle) is still questionable for
the game. He said Rogers will suit up and a decision will be made at game
time. "If we can get 20 plays from Shaun, that would be really good," Brown
said.
LB O. J. McClintock, who missed the OSU game with a bruised knee, appears
to
be completely recovered. He is an outstanding pass defender and probably
will
see a lot of action against the Sooners.
Major Applewhite took most of the snaps with the first team this week and
appears likely to be the starter against Oklahoma. He looked very sharp
last
week against Oklahoma State. He underwent off-season knee surgery, and
Brown
said Applewhite looked "like the old Major" against OSU.
Sophomore TB Kenny Hayter also got a lot work with the first team this week
after rushing for 122 yards against OSU.

This game is always a difficult one to figure because strange things happen
a
lot when the Longhorns and Sooners do battle. But I think the Longhorns
will
win if they can avoid getting any punts blocked because the two teams are
comparable in terms of offensive efficiency, but Texas appears to have a
much
better defense.
Oklahoma has outstanding linebackers and a good secondary, but the Sooner
line has not been a great run-stopping unit. The Longhorns should be able
to
run the ball better than the Sooners and that should be the difference in
the
game. Under Mack Brown, the Longhorns are 17-0 when they outrush their
opponents.

RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas
practice Thursday and spend a lot of time after practice talking to Brown
and
offensive coordinator Greg Davis. He was not due to get back into Dallas
until late tonight, but his father said he did not commit to the Horns and
probably will take some more time before making a decision. . . LB/DE
Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is being recruited by most
colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are wanting DEs with
great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 at a summer camp.
That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville,
Tenn., is still a likely future Longhorn. If Texas can corral Jackson and
Hall, that would give them two outstanding speed rushers from the corner if
they both wind up at end. The Longhorns have a great chance to get both of
them.

KICKOFF WEATHER FORECAST: If you are going to the game, the Weather Bureau
is
forecasting temperatures in the low 60s with a possible 30% chance of rain
at
11 a.m. Saturday when the game is scheduled to begin. If  rain does occur,
it
is expected to stop in the early afternoon.

BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Two heralded 6-2 stars who are so versatile
that
they have played point guard at times have committed to the Texas women's
basketball team. Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Calgary,
Alberta, Canada, both committed to coach Jody Conradt. Bowers is a national
top 25 player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be
invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team.  She also considered
Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She averaged 15.8 points
and
7.4 rebounds last season. Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for
Chestermere High School in Calgary. She was a member of the Canadiana
junior
national team. She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up
picking
Texas over Arizona State. Both girls played point guard at times last
season
and both are outstanding ball handlers. Conradt also has commitments from
forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of Windthorst, the state's hottest
prospect,
and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village
