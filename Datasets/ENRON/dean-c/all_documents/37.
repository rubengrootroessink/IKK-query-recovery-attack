ok... here is the scoop.  Wedding ceremony at 5:00pm at Grace Presbyterian
Church - Beltway and Westheimer in the Chapel.  Reception following at the
Majestic Metro - a map will be provided at the wedding.  Let me know if you
can make it and... if you are bringing a date.  Hope you can make it....
I'll be sure and save a dance for you - HA!
