As part of your preparation for the RUG meeting on Wednesday and Thursday,
please conduct an individual review of the Protocols Implementation Plan items
e-mailed by Vikki Gates on Sunday.  We will begin our review of the PIP on the
afternoon of the 6th .  In particular, the list below identifies PIP items 
that
require a review by RUG because of a potentially significant change in 
Protocol
language.

Item 103 - Default QSE
Item 107 - Uninstructed Deviation Tolerance Limit
Proposal by Floyd Trefny
Item 108 - Sub QSE (payment process, invoicing, and liability)
Proposal by C. Moseley
Item 109 - DC Tie (Oklaunion exclusion)
Proposal by Richard Ross
Item 120 - Local Balancing Energy Premium
Proposals by Don Blackburn and Manny Munoz
Item 126 - Plant vs. Resource Specific Output in OOME
Items 144 and 200 - LSE/QSE allocation of AS
Proposal by B. Jones
Item 146 - Notification vs. Posting of Loss Factors
Item 187 - TX SET Concurrent Processing Approach
Proposal by B. White
Item 204 - EPS Meter Data Transmittal
Proposal by J Cohea

In addition to to these items, the Protocols may have been changed to correct
unclear language or an inconsistency in the Protocols in an effort to 
reconcile
a gap.  These changes were identified in the PIP Master List as refinements 
and
carried a criticality assessment of 1.  I recommend your attention to these
items as well.

As there are about 100 PIP Items, we will not specifically address each one.
However, all parties are encouraged to raise questions or challenge any of the
reconciliation documents at the RUG meeting.
