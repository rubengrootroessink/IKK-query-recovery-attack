Brown Says Horns Have to Improve Running Game

The Longhorns worked out twice Monday, and coach Mack Brown praised the
players for giving a great effort, but he also voiced concern about the
lack
of a consistent running game.
"We've talked to the line about being more physical and we've talked to the
backs about running tougher, and we'll continue to work on that," he said.
The  lack of a consistent running game hurt the Horns at the end of last
season, and Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said they want to
have
a more balanced offense this season.
While Hodges Mitchell is clearly the No. 1 tailback, speedster Victor Ike
seems to be laying claim to the No. 2 spot behind him. Ike has beefed up to
about 200 pounds without losing any of his great speed, and he he has been
doing a good job of blocking and hanging on to the ball, two areas that
have
posed problems for him in the past.
Brown, meanwhile, isn't giving any hints about who he will start at
quarterback on Sept. 9. He had seemed to be leaning toward sophomore Chris
Simms, in the wake of off-season knee surgery for All-Big 12 QB Major
Applewhite. But then he started saying Applewhite seems to be completely
recovered from the knee injury.
He could have started Simms and blamed it on Applewhite's suspect knee, but
now that he says the knee is no longer suspect, I frankly don't know what
to
think. My gut feeling is that it will be Applewhite, but I sure wouldn't
bet
any money on it.
Tuesday's 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. practices will wrap up two-a-day practices.
School starts Wednesday and the last public workout will be a  6 p.m.
scrimmage Wednesday at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Brown said the players will be given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, then
will return Monday to start getting ready for the season opener Sept. 9
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
"We think it takes them two or three days to get their legs back, so we
always give them three days off just before the first game week of the
season," he said.

Fifth-year senior WR Brandon Healy made several outstanding catches Monday,
and Brown said he is "the most consistent guy we have at wide receiver
right
now."
But true freshmen Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson continue to be impressive
every day. They catch the long balls, the short balls and the in-between
balls, and they have outstanding speed.

Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said cornerbacks Quentin Jammer and
Roderick
Babers are playing well. He also said he is serious about playing more
people
this year. "We have a lot more depth on defense than we have had in our
other
two seasons here," he said.

INJURY UPDATE: Brown said DE Cory Redding has a sore shoulder and knee and
LG
Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst. He said both players will be held out
of Wednesday's scrimmage, but  should be able to resume practicing next
week.
He also said CB Ervis Hill's sore knee will keep him out of practice until
next week. Backup DT Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder, but might return to
workouts Tuesday, Brown said.

RECRUITING  NOTES: Mike Crowe, head coach at Corpus Christi Flour Bluff,
has
a new junior middle linebacker who drew rave reviews in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
last
year as a sophomore before his family moved to Texas. The budding star is
Andy Matakis, 6-3, 220, and fast. He ran a  4.4 40 at a camp in Pittsburgh
in
May. Crowe said Matakis "is a big kid who can really run. We're going to
play
him at middle linebacker and we'll probably try him at running back, too."
A
story in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month said Penn State and Ohio
State had offered Matakis scholarships before he moved to Texas. . . The
Longhorns still have 13 commitments, and they have an outside chance to get
No. 14 when DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., takes his official visit
the
Sept. 9 weekend.
