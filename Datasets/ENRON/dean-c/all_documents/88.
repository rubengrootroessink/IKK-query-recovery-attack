Roy Williams Stars Again; Brown Says Scaife Upbeat

This may sound like a repeat of an earlier fax, but freshman WR Roy
Williams
caught so many long passes Saturday that I lost count. Williams is so big
and
fast and smooth that he makes difficult catches look surprisingly easy.
I talked to one veteran Longhorn coach who told me Williams is easily the
best freshman wide receiver he has ever coached or seen. "He's kind of a
combination of Mike Williams and Lovell Pinkney," the coach said. "He's
even
faster than Mike, he's nearly as tall as Lovell and he catches the ball
better than either of them."
Freshmen receivers normally need some time to adjust to the way DBs jam
them
at the line of scrimmage, but Williams just runs through jams, then outruns
or outjumps whichever veteran DB has the misfortune to be trying to cover
him.
Coach Mack Brown said some of the veteran defensive backs came out to watch
the freshmen practice before the varsity checked in and saw Williams
running
wild, and some of the other freshman WRs looking very good, too. "Some of
those defensive guys said things were going to change when they get with
us,"
Brown said, then added with a chuckle, "but it hasn't changed much. They
(the
freshmen WRs) still look pretty good."
Sloan Thomas, B. J. Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen
WRs, and they also are making strong bids for playing time, but there is no
question that, right now, Williams is the brightest of the young star
receivers.
In addition to outstanding size, speed and body control, he makes quick
adjustment while the ball is in the air to get in just the right position
to
make the catch. If you haven't been to a Longhorn practice, you should come
to one just to see Williams in action.
Brown said there is a very good chance that all four of the freshmen WRs
will
play this year. "The thing we are going to try to do is win," he said. "If
they can help us win, they'll play, and they are looking pretty good right
now."

Brown said sophomore TE Bo Scaife is reasonably upbeat about the
season-ending knee injury he suffered Friday about one hour deep into the
first varsity practice. "He said it was great that he played last year, so
he
can count this as his redshirt year," Brown said.
Brown also said the doctors said the injury is not as severe as the one
Scaife suffered to his other knee in high school.

FOOTBALL NOTES: Kris Stockton is the starting punter and place kicker right
now. . . Brown said the team goal is to average 38 yards in net punting
this
season, which would be about nine yards better than the average last
season.
. . QB Major Applewhite still isn't showing any ill effects of off-season
knee surgery. . . Backup LB O. J. McClintock has intercepted two passes
during the two days of varsity practices. . . Freshman Stevie Lee and
redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are backing up star senior DTs Casey Hampton
and Shaun Rogers, and defensive coordinator Carl Reese says he expects big
things out of the two youngsters this season. . . Brown said Chad Stevens,
a
former tight end, will stay at fullback "because we're going to move our
fullback up to a tight end spot at times to have a two-tight-end look."

RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns' 12 early commitments include two players
who
are on almost all of the national top 100 lists

- OLs Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village
- and another who
was on all the lists two years ago
- OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC. UT also is
in great shape with  five other players who are on most national top 100
lists
- QB Brett Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, RB Cedric Benson of Midland, DT
Tommie Harris of Killeen Elllison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco and S DeWayne
Brandon of Temple. DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., is on several
national
top 100 lists, and he is a strong Texas lean.
