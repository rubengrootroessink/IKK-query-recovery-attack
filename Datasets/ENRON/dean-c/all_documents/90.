Scaife Injures Knee, Out for Season; Roy Williams Tears Up Varsity DBs

Sophomore TE Bo Scaife, the guy I figured the offense could least afford to
lose because of his blitz-breaking capabilities, tore the ACL in his left
knee during the Longhorns' first varsity workout Friday morning and he will
be out for the season.
Scaife, a sure-handed tight end with great speed, had surgery on his right
knee as a senior in high school. He was slowed by that injury last season,
but regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills.
Coach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire
season. The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt
season, since he did play some last season. That means he will have three
years of eligibility remaining, beginning in 2001.
"Now, he will have had them both fixed, they'll be stronger and maybe he
can
have three good years," Brown said.
Brown said Mike Jones, the starter last season at tight end, is a
sure-handed
receiver and outstanding blockers, but he said the Horns will miss Scaife's
speed. He said freshman Brock Edwards, who also has speed, but not as much
as
Scaife, will get a lot of work, starting Saturday, to see if he can help
take
up some of the slack left by Scaife's injury. He also said walk-on TE
Cullen
Loeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he
can contribute.
This was a major blow to the Texas offense, but there is some good news.
The
Longhorns probably have their best secondary since 1991, but freshman WR
Roy
Williams, 6-3, 208, long-armed and fast, fast, fast, treated the starting
cornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout,
catching
two long touchdown passes and tight-roping the sideline for two other big
catches. He dropped only one pass all day, and it was when he ran over an
obstacle. The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the
afternoon workout, so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the
afternoon.
All of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good, but Williams is looking
sensational. I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he
is the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian. There just
aren't a lot of people his size who can run 100 meters in 10.03, high jump
seven feet and broad jump a state record 26-5.
Even defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams. "I tell
you
what, he didn't look like a freshman to me," Reese said. "He looked pretty
good out there."
Sloan Thomas, B. J. Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen
WRs, and they all had their moments Friday. Thomas made some acrobatic
catches on balls that appeared to be overthrown, Johnson and Jeffery, a
high
school QB star who is making the switch to WR, both used their quickness to
get off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs.
The Longhorns are loaded at QB, with All-Big 12 Major Applewhite battling
budding star Chris Simms for the starting job. Both looked very sharp
throwing
long and short Friday, but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker
O. J. McClintock picked off two of Simms' passes and both might have scored
if it had been in a game-type scrimmage.
Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, appeared to be back to
normal. He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or
left, and his passes were on target. Simms also had a good day, except for
the two interceptions.

RECRUITING NOTES:  Don't be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric
Hall
of Clarksville, Tenn., is moved from the scheduled Sept. 9 date. Hall has a
game Friday night, Sept. 8, and UT's game on Saturday, Sept. 9, starts at
11:30 a.m. UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it
can
fly him to Austin, but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin,
too.
But NCAA rues don't allow schools to transport parents. So, the parents
would
have to fly commercially, which means they would either have to leave
before
his high school game that Friday, or come in Saturday, in which case they
would be too late for the Texas' season opener against Louisiana-
Lafayette.
. . The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen.
Look for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen,
including some big ends who might grow into tackles.
