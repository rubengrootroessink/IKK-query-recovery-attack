Part 2 of 3

3 Big Horns Drafted High

All-American OT Leonard Davis was the second player chosen in the NFL draft
Friday and Longhorn All-American teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the
first round.
Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first
choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick.
Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 19th pick in the fir=
st
round.
The Horns' other outstanding DT, Shaun Rogers, was picked in the second rou=
nd
by the Detroit Lions. He was the 61st pick overall.
The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in 1982=
.
Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme=
r
coach John Mackovic and his staff, and said he is hoping it starts a trend
that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year.
There might be a little fall off next year, but Longhorns should be very
popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in 2003.
Football Notes, Observations . .
UT QB Chris Simms says he is 100% sure he will stay at Texas for his senior
year.
There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season=
,
but he said he will stick around for his senior year.
Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference
include:
* More weapons to pick up those short-yardage plays to keep drives alive,
like a bigger, stronger running back, a more experienced offensive line and
don't forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a two-TE
set.
* More misdirection plays, particularly reverses and quick pitches to the
outside.
* More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns'
swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains.
Bears Maul Longhorns
The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in
Austin, but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games
of their series Saturday and Sunday.
Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out 10 Friday night to giv=
e
the Horns a 5-1 triumph in the first game of the crucial series.
Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense.
But the Bears got to apply the "mercy rule" twice in Waco, throttling the
Horns 14-4 in seven innings and 16-6 in eight innings.
Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that, coupled with
spotty pitching and very little hitting, turned the two games into routs.
Nebraska (15-4)  is running away with the regular season championship, and
Baylor (14-7) and Texas (16-8) are tied for second place. Texas Tech is
fourth (14-9) and OSU is fifth (12-9).

Offensive Coordinator Interview
Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses
on in spring practice.
The first is replacing the seniors, and the second  "is schematics, what we
did last season and what changes we need to make, what we should try to do
better."
All-American LT Leonard Davis and All-Big 12 RB Hodges Mitchell were the on=
ly
senior starters on last year's offense, and he said he feels a lot better a=
bo
ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell.
"Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle," Davis said. "We also
worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because we've got three really
good guards. Alfeo Randall (incoming JC transfer) also is a left tackle.
Considering all the possibilities, I think we'll be okay at left tackle."
"But I don't think we solved anything this spring at tailback," he said. "A=
ll
five guys did some good things, and we could play all five of them, but we
wanted somebody to step up and nobody did."
The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter, sophomores Bret=
t
Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran.
Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring, but he said none of t=
he
five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach.
Davis concurred, saying, "We're going into the pre-season practices with an
unsettled situation at tailback."
"Obviously, we're going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets
here," he added.
The youngster, of course, needs no identification. He is Cedric Benson, the
super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading
the Rebels to three straight state 5A championships.
As for a changing some things in the overall scheme, Davis said, "We wanted
to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that. It's an area
where we think we can add some things that will help us."
He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick
dashes to the outside. "Those things are not greased yet," he said, but I'm
glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them. It gives us some more
avenues to attack."
Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running
game to pick up short-yardage situations.
"We're not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount
of yardage," he said. "We want to do whatever it takes to win the game, but
there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage,
particularly for first downs, on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh=
en
we're trying to protect a lead."
Other than the uncertainty at tailback, Davis liked what he saw this spring=
.
"Our linemen had a good spring," he said. "Mike Williams at right tackle ha=
d
a great spring. I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso=
n.
"Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard," Davis said, "Mat=
t
Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps
behind Matt. I'm really pleased with Jason Glynn's development."
Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan Kirk-Hughes and
Tillman Holloway, who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries, retur=
n
for pre-season practice.
"Tight end will be a really solid position," he said. "Bo Scaife was able t=
o
get back into things (after knee surgery) and he had a really solid spring.
Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and we'll get Mike Jones (knee
surgery) back for the season."
"Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better," Davis
said. "Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well =
as
true freshmen and now they're a year older and more experienced."
He also said walk-on Kyle Shanahan, redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni=
or
Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action.
Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos' head coach and was a starter on =
a
scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus=
e
he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade.
After sitting out last season, Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball
as well as anybody on the team.
"This is a really solid group, with very good players and quality depth,"
Davis said. "We're really pleased with our wide receivers."
"At quarterback," he said, "you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h=
as
two like we do."
They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite, who
shattered most of Texas' passing records before severe injuries to both kne=
es
sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job.
Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma=
n
QB Chance Mock.
"Chance Mock is really talented," Davis said. "He has really good skills."
Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm. He also has =
a
very quick release.
"He needs to get some experience, but he has all the tools," Davis said.
So, looking at everything, how good can this Longhorn offense be?
"I think this group has a chance to be really good," he said. "We have a lo=
t
of talented players. We just need to solidify the running game, and we're
working on that."

UT Hires Volleyball Coach

Jerritt Elliott, 32, former interim head women's volleyball coach at the
University of Southern California, is the new head women's volleyball coach
at Texas.
He was the interim coach at USC for two years while former UT and current U=
SC
coach Mick Haley was coaching the U. S. Olympic Team.
Elliott replaces Jim Moore, who resigned.
A highly personable coach who is an outstanding recruiter, Elliott had the
top-rated recruiting classes in the nation both years he was at USC.
Last season, he led USC to its first final four appearance in 15 years and =
to
USC's first-ever share of the Pac-10 title.
USC also finished the year ranked No. 4 nationally by both the AVCA and
Volleyball Magazine.
USC compiled a 50-12 record under Elliott in these two years, going 29-3 la=
st
fall en route to the NCAA Final Four, and 21-9 in 1999.
In both years, Elliott was honored as the Pac-10 Conference Coach of the Ye=
ar
and was the 2000 Pacific Region Coach of the Year.
Elliott spent the last six years at USC (1995-2001), the last two years as
interim head coach and a four-year term prior to that as assistant coach.
Elliott accepted the interim head position in 1999 and 2000 in the absence =
of
Haley, who was serving as the USA National Team head coach through the  200=
0
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
Elliott also was named the USA Junior National Team Head Coach for the summ=
er
of 2001, but will relinquish that role with USA Volleyball due to his
appointment at UT.
"It is with tremendous pleasure that I accept the University of Texas
volleyball  head coach position," he said. "I am extremely enthusiastic abo=
ut
coming to Texas, which is considered one of the prominent volleyball progra=
ms
in the country."
