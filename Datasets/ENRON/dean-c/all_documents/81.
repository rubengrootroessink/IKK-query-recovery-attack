The state's top QB prospect, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas
Bishop
Lynch, visited Texas A&M last weekend and plans to fly to Boulder with his
father this weekend to take a look at Colorado.
But he said his heart still belongs to the Longhorns. "I really like
Texas,"
he said. "I had a nice time at A&M, but I don't think anyone is going to
beat
Texas."
He said he probably will be ready to announce his college choice shortly
after returning from Colorado, and he said he is almost positive that
choice
will be Texas.

James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota, Fla., is
generally considered to be the nation's top fullback. He took an unofficial
visit to Texas last month and said UT was one of his leaders. Now, he says
his big three are Texas, Florida State and Miami and he said he hopes to
make
decision later this month. He is a tremendous blocker and a very tough
inside
power runner.
