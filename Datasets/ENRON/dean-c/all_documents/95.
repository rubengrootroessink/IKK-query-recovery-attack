just a little propaganda.  some of this might be old, but it's still fun to 
read.

from a friend in Austin....
The uncut version.

i went to both the am and the pm practices yesterday, and let me
re-re-re-iterate that we have a great group of receivers and that the stud
dog bad ass mofo of the group is roy williams.  he is physically way beyond
not only vasher and the walkon CBs trying to cover him, but the rest of the
college ranks.  ahmad brooks was standing by him in street clothes, and
there ain't a chance he could stop roy.  roy flies past people and gets way
the fuck up there and takes the ball out of the clouds.  he's a fucking
randy moss, but you know what?  he's bigger than randy moss and as fast as
randy moss and probably has as good a vertical as randy moss:

Moss
height: 6'4"
weight:  198 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
vertical: ?

Roy
height: 6'5"
weight: 210 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
100 speed: 10.38
high jump: 6'10"
long jump: 24'

we may just have the next superhuman WR on our team.  pray for no injuries.
i'm going to the pm practice today, too.  got a hard-on just thinking about
roy.  probably will see a few NFL GMs there.

and the other WRs are spectacular, too.  sloan is 6'2" and does well at
establishing and holding position vs. the cover man.  BJ is 6'1" and has
really soft hands.  i watched BJ, vasher and jeffrey field 12-15 punts each
at 60 yds with a cross wind in the pm session.  vasher and jeffrey had
technical problems and bobbled or dropped almost half.  BJ never bobbled or
dropped one.  as soon as it's close, he just sucks it in and takes off.  and
that's how he catches balls on the crossing routes.  vacuum hands.

it's going to be unfuckingreal a year or two down the road when these guys
have experience and simms gets to throw to them on the field three at a
time.  you can't doubleteam them all.

put simply, i think the days of our using white 5'7" WRs are over.
