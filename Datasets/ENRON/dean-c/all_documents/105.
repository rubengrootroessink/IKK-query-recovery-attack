The State of the Longhorns: Good and Getting Better

My faxes are normally about hot breaking news, but this  one is about the
big
picture, as I see it, on the state of the current Longhorn football team
and
on the recruiting front.
First, let's look at the 2000 season prospects. The Longhorns are better
equipped to handle all comers this year than they have been in a long, long
time. The 2000 Texas defense is the best since 1991, when the defense was
great, but the offense and kicking game were so bad that it resulted in a
losing season and a new coaching staff.
The Longhorn defense won't allow many teams to run the ball at all. The
tackles, linebackers and defensive backs are killers against the run, and
the
young ends are getting better every practice. Sophomore DE Cory Redding is
going to be a great one, and true freshman Kalen Thornton looks like he is
going to be a quick developer on the other side.
The offense has two great quarterbacks in Major Applewhite and Chris Simms,
and, for those who say a two-quarterback system can't work, coach Mack
Brown
is quick to point out that he used a two-QB system twice at North Carolina
and won 11 games one time and 10 the other.
It also has some freshmen wide receivers who don't play like freshmen. Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson are ready for prime time already, and Sloan
Thomas
is getting there. They are all big and fast. Last year, Texas had one big
wide receiver last year, but he wasn't very fast. Redshirt freshman Artie
Ellis also is big and he's pretty fast, too.
The Longhorns also have some capable running backs and an offensive line
that
definitely is a lot better than it was late last season. The only big cloud
hovering over the offense is the question about whether they will be able
to
grind out yardage when they need to control the clock. I think they will be
able to score and score quite a bit on everybody they play, but they
probably
will have to do it with big plays, rather than 16-play drives.
After attending every practice during 2-a-days, I predict a 10-1 or 11-0
regular season record.

Now, let's talk recruiting. I went to San Antonio to see the triple header
in
the Alamodome and am happy to report that Cedric Benson, the great Midland
Lee running back who is the Longhorns' most recent commitment, is even
better
than he was last year.
He's about 10 pounds bigger at around 198, and his coach, John Parchman,
says
he has lowered his time in the 40 from the high 4.5s to a consistent 4.4.
He
looked quicker than last year, and he was fast enough last year to shatter
all the Class 5A rushing and scoring records.
Running behind an all-new offensive line, he carried 14 times for 140
yards,
including a 52-yard scoring run on his third carry of the game. He also had
a
pass reception for 36 yards.
Lee beat a good Victoria Memorial team, 40-12. Memorial is a combination of
the two Class 5A schools in Victoria, one of which went 8-3 last year.
Fred Thrweatt, the 6-2, 300-pound Midland Lee defensive tackle who was a
dominant force in the Class 5A championship game last year, was at it again
Saturday. He was a tremendous run-stopper, who also harassed the Memorial
QBs
when they tried to pass. He says Texas has offered him, and I hope he
accepts
because, next to Killeen's awesome Tommie Harris, he is as good as any I
have
seen in Texas this year. DE Dwight Washington, 6-4, 232, is another Lee
standout who will get a lot of Division I offers. He is an outstanding pass
rusher.
For your future's book, put down QB Chad Schroeder, 6-1, 170, 4.5, of
Austin
Westlake. He's the son of highly successful Westlake coach Ron Schroeder
and
he's only a junior. He has a good arm and really quick feet. But he broke a
collarbone in the Chaps' hard-earned 17-10 victory over a tough San Antonio
MacArthur team in the first game of that tripleheader.
In the second game, which pitted the two undefeated Class 4A champions from
last year, Texas City struck quickly and outlasted Stephenville, 39-33.

FOOTBALL  NOTES: The team returns to practice Monday after getting three
days
off to rest the players' tired legs. . . Derrick Curry, a fifth-year senior
reserve defensive tackle, has quit the team.
