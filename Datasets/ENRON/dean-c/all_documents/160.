At the TAC meeting in October, TAC formed the
Protocol Implementation Work Group (PIWG).  The
timeline for the work group's activities included
a milestone of ERCOT staff delivering a summary of
the Protocol/System gaps on November 15th.  This
message is the delivery of that summary.

The Consortium conducted a reconciliation of the
November 1 Protocols to the system design.  ERCOT
staff reviewed the reconciliation provided by the
Consortium.  There were a number of issues
included in the reconciliation that are still
under review with the vendors.  The finalization
of that review is being completed as quickly as
possible.  Based on the decisions during the
review, there may be some more issues that will
need to be added to the Protocol Implementation
Plan (PIP).

There were a number of issues that relate to
things that are in the November 1 Protocols that
are not in the current system design and will not
be available on June 1, 2001.  ERCOT staff worked
very hard over the last few days to prepare those
issues to be sent to the PIWG for review and
criticality analysis.  ERCOT staff used the
November 1 Protocols as a baseline.  We boxed the
language that related to things that would not be
available and in effect on June 1, 2001.  The box
includes a PIP Issue number, explanation of the
reason the Nov. 1 language is in the box, and an
explanation of the restoration process for the
November 1 language.  In the body of the Protocol
document, we drafted redline language which
reflects what will be in place on June 1, 2001.

The attached files contain:

(1)   PIP Master List - This is a master list of
all the Protocol Implementation Plan (PIP) issues
that have been identified to date.  It contains an
issue name, Protocol subsection reference, summary
of the issue, status, and ERCOT author.

(2)  A file for each PIP issue which contains an
excerpt from the Nov. 1 Protocol reflecting the
boxes and redlined language.

(3)  Reconciliation documents for PIP issues that
the PIWG has already discussed.

All of these issues will be discussed at PIWG
meetings.  We will be working with Brad Jones,
PIWG Chair, to set up the meeting days and the
agenda for reviewing each of these issues.  The
agenda will be published prior to the meetings so
that organizations have the opportunity to
identify the appropriate persons to attend.  In
addition, ERCOT staff will be working with the
PIWG during the discussions of each issue.

The PIWG has a lot to accomplish in a short amount
of time.  ERCOT staff has prepared the issues to
help expedite the process and contribute to the
process.  We look forward to completing the PIP.
