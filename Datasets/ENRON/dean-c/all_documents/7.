Top UT Basketball Assistant Gets Head Job at Siena

Rob Lanier, 32, the Longhorns' top assistant basketball coach and lead=20
recruiter for the last two years, was named head coach at Siena College
in=20
Loudonville, N.Y., Wednesday.
UT head coach Rick Barnes was out of town on a recruiting trip, but he
issue=
d=20
a statement praising Lanier and saying he is as qualified to be a head
coach=
=20
as any assistant coach he has known.
Barnes gave no indication when he will name a new assistant. Six of his=20
former assistants have become college head coaches and that is because
he=20
always hires a bright, young assistant on the way up who also happens to
be=20
an outstanding recruiter. He only has them for a year or two, but they
are=20
very productive during that time, and then he goes out and finds
another=20
bright, young one to take the departed guy's place.
Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns,
including=20
most of last year's top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T. J.
Ford=

QUAN COSBY UPDATE: I talked to Albert Satchell tonight. He is the guardian
o=
f=20
heralded UT recruit Quan Cosby. He told me that Quan Cosby told a TV
reporte=
r=20
he probably would give up football if he is one of the first 10 players=20
chosen in the major league draft. Some callers have told me today that the
T=
V=20
reporter quoted Cosby as saying he would choose baseball if he is drafted
in=
=20
the first 10 rounds. I didn't hear the TV report, but there is a big=20
difference in being one of the first 10 players drafted and being drafted
in=
=20
the first 10 rounds. With 30 major league teams, 300 players will be
chosen=20
in the first 10 rounds. Anyway, after talking to Satchell, my blood
pressure=
=20
has returned to normal because Cosby, while he is a great athlete and=20
undoubtedly is an outstanding baseball player, will not be one of the
first=20
10 players drafted. He probably will be one of the first 300. The
biggest=20
difference in being one of the first 10 guys drafted and being the 300th
guy=
=20
drafted is about $2 million  or $3 million.
* * * *
I've had some calls today saying there are reports on some internet
sites=20
that redshirt freshman LB Rashad Thomas has left the team. He was out
workin=
g=20
out with the rest of them (voluntarily, of course) yesterday, so unless
he=20
quit today, he's still a Longhorn.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: L'Tydrick Riley of Crockett is one of the
state's=
=20
top junior recruits. he plays QB at Crockett, but projects as a WR in=20
college. He's big, fast, athletic and he's an Aggie lean, primarily
because=20
his uncle, Claude Riley, also from Crockett, played basketball at A&M,=20
probably about 20 years ago. But young Riley says he plans to attend camps
a=
t=20
UT and A&M this summer. With our facilities and coaching staff and
city,=20
compared to the Aggies' facilities and coaching staff and city, I like
our=20
chances. . . Texas probably will award about 20 to 22 scholarships in=20
February and as many as six or seven of them could be filled by
defensive=20
linemen. After years of skimpy crops of defensive linemen, there are a lot
o=
f=20
top juniors around and many of them really like the Longhorns. DTs Lyle=20
Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch,=20
Colo., are sons of former Longhorn stars. DE Chase Pittman of
Shreveport=20
Evangel is the brother of Cole Pittman, the popular young Longhorn DT who
wa=
s=20
killed in  a traffic accident about six weeks ago in a tragedy that shook
th=
e=20
UT campus. I like our chances will all three of these fine out-of-state=20
prospects. The Longhorns also are in strong contention for two top DTs
in=20
Texas (Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Earl Anderson of San Marcos)
an=
d=20
also for two top DEs (Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Larry Dibbles
of=20
Lancaster). They also are in the race for several other top prospects in
the=
=20
defensive line, so signs point to UT having a great class of defensive=20
linemen to go along with the great class of offensive linemen who are
coming=
=20
in as freshman this year. . . The Longhorns' first summer camp will begin
on=
=20
June 4, which is just a little more than six weeks away.  That's when
coach=20
Mack Brown and his assistants usually start raking in top commitments,
and=20
they are poised to do it again because many of the top players like
Texas=20
enough to at least consider committing early. Just remember, Jonathan
Scott=20
did it in early June last year.

TRACK RECRUITING NOTE:  Sage Thames of Wolfforth Frenship, the nation's

high school pole vaulter, has signed with Texas. Thames, already a

state Class 4A champion, has vaulted 17-7, which is the seventh highest

in national high school history.
