Jefferson LB Lance McFarland Says He Is Committing to Horns

Linebacker Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, of Jefferson told me tonight
(Tuesday) he is trying to call UT assistant coach Darryl Drake to commit to
the Longhorns.
"I just decided I was ready to get the recruiting process behind me," he
said. "I have always liked Texas and I'm ready to give my commitment."
He said he has scholarship offers from Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Arkansas,
Kansas State and LSU.
McFarland has great speed for a linebacker. He won the so-called "fat boy
100" at an East Texas track meet with an 11.3 clocking after his sophomore
year. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed in the event.
He will be the Longhorns' 14th commitment. The others are super RB Cedric
Benson of Midland Lee, OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of
Jersey Village, Matt Garcia of Galena Park, Will Allen of Cypress Falls,
Roman Reeves of Livingston, Terrance Young of Longview and Alfio Randall of
Blinn JC; LB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, CB Cedric Griffin of San
Antonio Holmes, WR-CB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, DB Braden Johnson of
Euless Trinity and QB/S Kendal Briles of Wolfforth Frenship.
Benson and Scott are national top 25 players and Robinson and Briles also
have made some national top 100 lists.
FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., DE Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and
OL Williams Winston of Houston Madison all say they plan to come to the
UT-Houston game Sept. 23. Buchanon and Jakes will be taking their official
visits to Texas that weekend.
I said I wouldn't have any more faxes this week, and here this one is, but
it
is shorter than usual because I have a very early flight to California
Wednesday and I have to get this going so I can shut everything down before
I
leave. For those of you who normally get late faxes early the nexrt
morning,
I apologize for sending this one so late, but it was either do it now or at
4:30 a.m. tomorrow.
