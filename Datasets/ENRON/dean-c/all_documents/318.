After reading this I am wondering how we modeled Fronterra for testing.  

Anyone know?

Thanks,

See attached EMail from John Adams:

If this approach to Combined Cycle Plants (separate Resource ID's for each GT 
and ST) is of concern to you, please let your client rep  and John Adams 
know. This approach leads to multiple resource id's for plants that are in 
many cases managed at a plant level...not "unit" level as this approach 
implies. The burden to submit resource plans at the component level and the 
possibility of receiving a Unit Specific deployments, along with the 
proliferation of resource id's (many of these plants are owned by multiple 
entities...leading to even more resource id's) points out that different 
solution is needed. Greg Graham ggraham@lcra.org

Robert 

There has been considerable discussion and argument over the need of the 
security applications to have each unit described in the model uniquely to 
allow

the stability applications to work properly. 

Operations has argued strongly that every unit over a size (20 mw) has got to 
be modeled for the stability analysis modules to work.

I understand that every unit modeled in registration MUST have a 
corresponding ( one to one) entry in the network model.? 

As I understant it, this leads to the following chain where the symbol => 
means "requires" 

Operations needs all synchronous units > 20 MW? modeled & telemeter=> 
All units over 20 MW must be registered uniquely (elements of combined cycle 
plants registered uniquely)?? Consequence of Design

All units must be settled matching the registration database => 
??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? Consequence of Design

All resource plans must be submitted for each unit of a Combined Cycle unit 
=> 
Jointly owned Combined Cycle units must submit resource plan items for each 
owner of each unit of a Combined Cycle plant for each scheduling period =>

A combined cycle plant with 6 units and 3 owners results in 6 * 3 * 96 
entries per day. 

I understand many QSE's are balking at this requirement as burdensome and 
un-necessary. (LCRA, OXY,etc) 

We also have a problem with modeling of MANY MANY very small resources to get 
them into the settlement system. 

It occurs to me that the Operations Requirement is NOT that the individual 
units be settled separately, or scheduled separately.? Only that they be 
modeled separately and telemetered separately. 

Why can't we have a single entry in the settlement system map to many units 
in the network model, and conversely have many entries in the settlement 
system (many small units) map to a single, or even NO entry in the network 
model?

Why can't we break the link between unit registration and the network model?? 
or at least modify it?? Or do I mis-understand the situation?

Please let me know if my understanding of the situation is correct or correct 
me if I misunderstand.? I would appreciate suggestions on how to improve the 
situation.

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss the following topics: 
Gen. unit consolidation (generation units of less than 20 mW)
Gen. unit consolidation (generation units of 20mW or greater from PUCT SGC 
certificated resource entity)
Gen. units behind a large industrial meter (PUCT SGC certification)
Network model names for new resources


The meeting will be held at the small conference room in the blue building at 
9:30. 
If you are not able to attend, please send someone in place.?
