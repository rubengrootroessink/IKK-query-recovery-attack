Applewhite Works Out, But Brown Says  Simms Will Start

QB Major Applewhite worked out Tuesday without any obvious problems with
his
sprained knee, but coach Mack Brown said backup QB Chris Simms will start
Friday against Texas A&M.
"If it (the knee) doesn't swell, he has a chance to be available to play if

we need him to win," Brown said, adding that the trainers will check
Applewhite's knee after each practice to see if there is any swelling.
"Major did everything today," he said. "He dropped back, he sprinted out,
and
I was surprised at how well he was moving."
But Brown said Simms will start and Applewhite will be held in reserve in
case he is needed.
"The doctors said Major is between questionable and probable," Brown said.
He
said he isn't sure what that means, but it probably means he can play in a
pinch ? and that means if the coaches feel Simms isn't getting the job done

and the team is in danger of losing the game.
"Chris will start the game for us," Brown said, "and if Major is healthy
enough to go, we will use him to win the ball game if necessary."
Brown said  safety Lee Jackson and TE Brock Edwards, both battling leg
injuries, won't be able to play against A&M.
Brown also encouraged all fans to meet the team two hours before the game
Friday. The team will arrive at the south end of Royal Memorial Stadium at
12:30 p.m. Brown said the team will need a lot of fan support to wind
Friday
and remain unbeaten this year at home.
Defensive coordinator  Carl Reese said he will use a lot of defensive
formations against A&M, but he said the traditional 4-3 probably will be
used
most of the time because of the Aggies' strong running game.
"They really like to use their power running game," he said, "and that's
something we have to stop. They can throw the ball much better than in the
past, but we need to make them one-dimensional."

THE WEATHER: The weather forecast for Friday afternoon calls for
temperatures
in the high 50s, some thunderstorms and possibly some gusting winds.

Senior OT Leonard Davis was the only Longhorn chosen for the Football
Writers
Association of America's All-America team. WR Roy Williams and DE Kalen T
hornton were chosen to the Rivals.com True Freshman All-America team and
WR B. J. Johnson made honorable mention. Williams was chosen as the
offensive
player of the year.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: I missed a Longhorn who committed to A&M in my
fax/e-mail last night. CB Roderick Babers said he committed to A&M "for
about
two hours, and then Mack Brown talked me out of it."  The others who
committed to A&M before switching to Texas are QB Major Applewhite, OT
Leonard Davis and backup TB Victor Ike. Another Longhorn who came close to
being an Aggie is redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock, who was all set to
commit
to A&M last year before taking a trip to Texas "just to be sure." He said
Texas would have "to blow me away" to keep him from committing to A&M. When

he got back home and committed to Texas, he had a simple explanation. "They

blew me away," he said. . . DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and S
Dewayne
Brandon of Temple, two of the state's top players, both plan to come to the

game Friday. Many other top players would have attended, but they are on
playoff teams and have games to play Friday or Saturday. . . Here's my very

early top dozen Texas' recruits for next year: QB Reggie McNeal, 6-3, 180,
4.5, Lufkin; WR J. T. Perry, 6-1, 180, 4.4, Allen; DTs Rodrique Wright,
6-5,
300, 5.0, Alief Hastings; Earl Anderson,  6-4, 270, 4.9, San Marcos, and
Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.7, Mesquite; DE Travis Leitko, 6-5, 255, 4.7, The

Woodlands; LBs Marvin Byrdsong, 6-3, 240, 4.5, Longview; Andy Matakis, 6-3,

220, 4.55, Corpus Christi Flower Bluff, and Archie McDaniel, 6-3, 225, 4.7,

Bay City; S Michael Cuba, 6-3, 190, Taylor, and Athletes Vincent Young,
6-5,
200, 4.5, Houston Madison, and Broderick Thomas, 6-0, 190, 4.5, Longview.
