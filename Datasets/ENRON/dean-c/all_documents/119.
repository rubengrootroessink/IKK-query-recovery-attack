Simms Working as First Team QB; Horns Get Pledge from Tyler DB

Sophomore QB Chris Simms worked with the first team during Tuesday's
practice, and, if past practices mean anything, that is a pretty good sign
that he will start Saturday night against Houston.
Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the
start. Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the
Stanford game and he got the start.
Coach Mack Brown won't say who will start at quarterback, but it doesn't
make
a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team, so it
looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday. Simms is more mobile
than Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, and he also led the
Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford, despite only getting
14
snaps to Applewhite's 58. Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two
touchdowns, but they were both in the fourth quarter.
Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who
are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk
shows
"are hurt. That's the way we feel, too. Our players are hurt and our
coaches
are hurt. None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play
that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times."
But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense
rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a
touchdown
on a blocked punt.
Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its
punter up shorter than usual. "He's 13 yards back, just like every other
team
in the country, and we try to get the punt off in 2.1 seconds or less. He
got
the one that was blocked off in 1.9 seconds, but a kid who blocked it
perfectly on the other 11 punts let his guy come through untouched, and it
got blocked."
The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked, but my sources tell me
Brown
chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make
that same mistake again.
Folks, I guarantee you Brown, his assistants and his players are more upset
than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard
this week to correct things. Remember, the guy the stadium was named after
was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in 20 years at Texas.
Bobby
Bowden is a pretty good coach, too, and his perfect season at Florida State
last year was his first one.
TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford, and
the
coaches have corrected that. Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play
more Saturday than he has been playing, and he said redshirt freshman Kenny
Hayter also might see considerable action. "We're going to play as many as
it
takes," Brown said. "We have to get our running game going better."
He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to full-time duty
Saturday. He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized
for
an infected cyst. "That would help us a lot," he said. "Derrick is one of
our
top offensive linemen."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai
Pearson
will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson, who  has a
pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game.
Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent, but he said Jackson's experience
will
be missed.
Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad
Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns' nickel and dime
packages. He said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a
lot
Saturday "because Houston will throw it about 50 times."

ANOTHER RECRUIT COMMITS: Texas has 16 commitments now after getting a
pledge
from Tyler CB Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42. Ross had offers from Alabama,
Arkansas, Baylor, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M and others, but said he
committed
to Texas "because I've always been a Longhorrn fan, and I really like the
Texas coaches." He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas
coaches who recruited him, and he said Withers, the Texas secondary coach,
came to see him play in his second game this season. He is a big, fast
corner
with long arms, but don't look for him to get many interceptions this year
because he hasn't had a pass thrown in his direction all year because he is
so good at tight man-for-man coverage.
