Horns Favored by 19, but Brown Predicts Close Game Saturday

The Longhorns are 19 points over Oklahoma State Saturday in their Big 12
Conference opener that will kick off at 11 a.m. and will be televised over
much of the nation by ABC, but coach Mack Brown said Wednesday he expects a
close game that won't be decided until the fourth quarter.
He said Oklahoma State has the best defense Texas has faced this year, and
he
said 230-pound RB Reggie White, who is averaging 127 yards per game
rushing,
"is the best running back we've seen."
With All-Big 12 DT Shaun Rogers likely to miss the game with a sprained
ankle
and freshman backup Stevie Lee out for about six weeks with a broken bone
in
his foot that required surgery and the insertion of a pin, Brown said the
Longhorns don't have much depth at defensive tackle.
He said sophomore Cole Pittman, a former tackle who was starting at end,
has
been moved back to tackle. Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs, who played well
against Houston after Rogers was injured, will start alongside All-American
Casey Hampton, with Pittman and little-used junior Miguel McKay as the
backups.
I asked Brown if Lee might get a medical redshirt, since he was hurt so
early
in the season, and he said Lee is eligible for one if he isn't able to play
again this season. If he gets a medical redshirt, he would be a freshman in
eligibility again next year.
For those of you who are curious about what it takes to get a medical
redshirt, Brown said a player is eligible for a medical redshirt if he
incurs
a season-ending injury before the fourth game if he has played in less than
20% of the plays. Lee was injured in the second game and, as a backup
tackle,
had not played in 20% of the plays. Brown said if  Lee does recover in time
to play late this season, he would not be eligible for a medical redshirt.
Brown said the Longhorn defense, which was outstanding in Saturday's 48-0
rout of Houston, had an average day in practice Tuesday, "but they played
better today."
He said he has told the defense "that they need to understand Reggie White
is
the best running back we've seen this year, and, with Stevie Lee out and
we're not sure about Shaun Rogers, it really hurts our depth."
Brown said the team goal is to "get 100 rushing yards and hold them under
100
yards rushing."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Kalen Thornton will start at DE in
place of Pittman. Thornton will be the first true freshman to start for the
Longhorns this season.
Reese also was asked if Tubbs, who had two sacks against Houston in his
first
extended action, is better as a pass rusher than as a run defender. "He's
about the same guy in there," Reese said. "He's a big guy with good
athletic
ability and he played at a high level against Houston. We need to him to
play
at the same high level Saturday."
Because of OSU's running ability, Reese also said his strong-side
linebackers, Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins, will get to play a lot more
Saturday than they have been playing. Reese pulls his strong backers and
plays an extra defensive back against passing teams, but he said the strong
backers "might get to play as much as 70% of the time Saturday."
Of course, Cowboy QB Tony Lindsay is dangerous running and throwing, and,
if
he gets hot through the air, that could change Reese's plans.
