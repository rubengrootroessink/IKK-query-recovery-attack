Freshmen Score 3 TDs in Saturday Scrimmage

The Longhorns scored four touchdowns in their Saturday scrimmage, and three
of them were scored by true freshmen. And, no, Roy Williams was not one of
the TD makers. Williams has been the freshman star of the early practices,
but fellow freshmen B. J. Johnson, Nathan Vasher and Sloan Thomas showed
Saturday they are ready for prime time, too.
Chris Simms connected with senior Brandon Healy for a 63-yard pass-and-run
play to open the scoring, but then the freshmen took over. Major Applewhite
found Johnson just breaking past CB Quentin Jammer for a 75-yard
pass-and-run
touchdown against the first-team defense. It was the first touchdown the
second-team has scored against the defensive starters in their two
scrimmages.
Johnson made a great catch in traffic, then turned on the speed to complete
the long scoring play.
Vasher, however, had the longest scoring jaunt of the day, bolting 79 yards
on a punt return. He made a couple of great moves to get started, then used
his speed to outrun the pursuit.
Beau Trahan, who was moved from safety to quarterback last week, threw a
beautiful pass to Thomas for a 15-yard scoring play.
Simms again took all the snaps for the first team and Applewhite, last
year's
co-Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, again worked with the second team.
Brown said no decision has been made on which QB will be the starter in the
season opener, but he did say no significance should be given to the fact
the
Simms has worked with the first team throughout the first two scrimmages.
He
said the coaches know what Applewhite can do with the first team, and they
want to see what Simms can do with the first team.
Simms, leading the starters against the second-team defense, had only
slightly better statistics than Applewhite, who went against the defensive
starters all day. Simms completed 7 of 17 passes for 142 yards, with the
63-yard touchdown pass to Healy. He also gave up an interception by backup
linebacker O. J. McClintock. Applewhite completed 6 of 18 passes for 119
yards, including the TD pass to Johnson. He also allowed a pick by walk-on
defensive back Chad Davis.
Backup TBs Victor Ike and Ivan Williams led the rushers with 34 and 25
yards,
respectively. Ike had seven carries and Williams had five.
The first-team defense, which was No. 6 in the nation last year in yardage
allowed, has been very stingy against the run throughout the fall drills.
Healy led the receivers with four catches for 102 yards, but Johnson was
close behind with two grabs for 94 yards.
Coach Mack Brown thanked the approximately 2,000 Longhorn fans who attended
the 9:30 a.m. scrimmage, and he said the players were tired, but still gave
a
great effort.
He said Williams hurt his shoulder, but it was not serious and did not
prevent him from going back in the game. He also said Vasher showed "great
quickness" on his scoring punt return, and said he will "probably be used
on
some punt returns this year."
The first-team offense scored on its first possession against the
second-team
defense when Simms found Healy open all alone down the middle, but the
second-team defenders held the starters without another score. The
second-team defense is much more talented this year than it was last year,
and defensive coordinator Carl Reese said that will allow him to rest the
starters more and keep his players fresher.
Fan appreciation day begins at 2 p.m. Sunday at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Brown
urged all Longhorn fans to show up. Players and coaches will be available
for
autographs.

RECRUITING  NOTE: Getting a commitment from Midland Lee running back Cedric
Benson, Texas Football Magazine's first high school cover boy, is going to
help the Longhorns snare some more top players. It may not help with
running
backs, but it always helps to get a super star at a skill position. Since
Benson rushed for 3,526 yards and scored 51 touchdowns in Class 5A last
year,
he definitely qualifies as a  super star.
