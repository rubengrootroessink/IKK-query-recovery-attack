hello, nope I haven't had chance to get my bike from my parents house, 
actually didn't go over there this weekend.  I am felling better, I really 
think I needed that sleep.  I have to get those prc things done and get 
everything ready for the big NO trip.  We'll see how things are going this 
week...  sp

I'm glad you are feeling better.  Did you ever get a chance to get your bike 
from your parents house?  Maybe when can go riding some time soon.  Let me 
know if you want to get together some time this week after work.  I know you 
probably have a lot to do before your weekend coming up.  

Clint
