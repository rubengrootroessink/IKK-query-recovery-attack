No TV for Buffs; Brown Says Horns Need Best Game to Win Saturday

The Texas-Colorado game in Boulder on October 14 has been set for 2:30 p.m.
Austin time, and 1:30 Colorado time and it will not be televised. There is
no
possibility of a pay-per-view live telecast because that would  conflict
with
the ABC Big 12 telecast and the Big 12's contract with ABC does not allow
such conflicts.
Incredibly, one of the games that was chosen over Texas-Colorado was Texas
A&M-Baylor.

Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorns "have to play better than we've
played so far this year to have a chance to win" Saturday's big game with
unbeaten Oklahoma.
"Josh Heupel is as good a quarterback as there is in the country," Brown
said. "They are running the ball much better this year, and they have a lot
of talent on both sides of the ball."
Heupel lit up the Texas defense for 17 points in the first quarter last
year,
but the Longhorns came back for a 38-28 victory. "I went to get a drink of
water and when I got back we were down by 17 last year," Brown quipped.
Brown said SS Lee Jackson should be able to play Saturday, but he said DT
Shaun Rogers is still questionable because of the sprained ankle he
sustained
in the victory over Houston. The Horns will return to practice Tuesday and
Brown said he'll know a lot more about the chances of Rogers being able to
play after he sees what he can do Tuesday.
Brown said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but he  said
sophomore Kenny Hayter played well in gaining 122 yards against Oklahoma
State and will get a lot of playing time.
Hayter is a 215-pound power runner and Brown said "big backs wear the other
team down." Hayter made most of his yards against OSU in the second half,
and
Brown said he hopes the Horns will be able to run with some success
Saturday.
He didn't say who would start at quarterback, but he did say Major
Applewhite
is "looking more like the old Major every week." Applewhite underwent knee
surgery in January and Brown said Applewhite seems to be gaining more
confidence in the knee. "He made some plays off-schedule Saturday," Brown
said, adding that he will need to make some more off-schedule plays
Saturday
to give the Longhorns a chance to win.
Brown said Applewhite's quick recovery has been a surprise. "I wasn't even
sure he would be able to play until mid-season," he said.
He also said the Longhorns are much deeper in the secondary than they have
been, and he said that will help a lot against Oklahoma because of the
Sooners' league-leading passing attack. He said cornerbacks Quentin Jammer
and Roderick Babers "have really improved our secondary." He also noted
that
defensive coordinator Carl Reese can use Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill, last
year's starting cornerbacks, in his nickel and dime packages on obvious
passing downs. Of course, against Oklahoma, any down can be an obvious
passing down.
Brown also said the Longhorn fans were a big factor in the team's comeback
win last year against OU. "They stayed positive when we fell behind," he
said.

RECRUITING NOTES: QB Brent Rawls, 6-5, 195, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel,
said
he really enjoyed his official visit to Texas last weekend, but he said he
wants to take an official visit to Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend before
making a decision. He also has taken an official visit to Purdue and the
Boilermakers are very much in the picture because Rawls says they don't
have
as many young quarterbacks as Texas. . . DE Kevin Everett of  Port Arthur
Jefferson came to the game OSU game on an unofficial visit, and said he had
a
great time.  But he said he wants to make some official visits before
committing to anyone. . . QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch says he
would like to come to a Texas practice this week or next week. He visited
LSU
last weekend and had a great time, but he still says the Longhorns are his
No. 1 choice. He might commit to Texas when he comes to the team practice.
Nordgren is the best QB prospect in Texas and Rawls is the top one in
Louisiana, so the Horns just need to be sure they get one of them. . .
Super
LB Derrick Johnson of Waco had an incredible 30 tackles Friday night in his
team's loss to powerful Tyler John Tyler.
