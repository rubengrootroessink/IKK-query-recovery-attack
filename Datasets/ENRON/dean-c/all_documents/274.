DJ Texas Power Export Capacity Returns To Normal

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Southwestern Electric Power Co. confirmed Monday that a
breaker problem near the 600-megawatt eastern direct-current tie has been
repaired, allowing exports from Texas to return to normal.

The breaker problem, which began last month at the coal-fired Welsh plant
in
Cason, Texas, could have lasted all summer, the utility had warned the
Independent System Operator for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

The breaker problem had limited exports by 100 MW from Ercot into the
adjacent
Southwest Power Pool.

SWEPCO is a unit of American Electric Power (AEP).

The east DC tie connects the transmission network of TXU Electric and
SWEPCO.

The east DC tie is the larger of two devices in the state, which allow a
combined 800 MW of power to be imported or exported from Ercot to SPP.

Ercot's northern DC tie, which connects the West Texas Utilities Co.
system to
Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, is rated at 220 MW.
