Hi Baby,
?
How are you?? How's work?? Instead of  calling you, I rolled over an emailed 
you. :)? I have a lot to do today, so  I've gotta get going.? I just wanted 
to say hi and to tell you that I miss  you.? I know that it's only been 1 
week since I saw you, but I miss you a  lot.? I wish you were coming to see 
just me this weekend.? (If you  know what I mean!)
?
Emily and I had fun last night.? (The whole  time I wish you were 
there-especially at Shakespeare's)? We went  barhopping.? We ended up at the 
library and played pool with these Sooners  for a couple of hours.? (Em's a 
big pool person)
?
I will check my email throughout the  day.
?
Love you,
Jenn
