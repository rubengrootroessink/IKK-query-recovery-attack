FYI -

We have a new tool at our disposal to assist in the transfer of EOL information from Enpower to the Inc sheets. I've saved it as the "EOL Download" in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000/EOL Download.

You can use this workbook to download EOL deals throughout the day. It's fairly self-explanatory, but here are a few suggestions:

1. If necessary, limit your query to one region using the boxes in the upper-left-hand corner.
2. Click "Download Deals," and enter your Enpower password when prompted. Be sure to check that you are downloading for the current day.
3. Once deals have populated the screen (should take no more than 30-45 seconds), filter for the hour and/or delivery point you need.
4. Copy all relevant rows and paste directly into the appropriate Inc sheet.

This sheet has just enough flexibility to make it functional and keep it simple. All it does is download EOL deals from Enpower - nothing more. If you'd like to see this expanded upon, feel free to give me suggestions.

Thanks.
