We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/17/01.  HE1-6, 23-24pdt, we are 13mw short (total of 104mw).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #821995.1

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
