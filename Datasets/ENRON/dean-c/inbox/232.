I believe all the bugs have been worked out of this one. It pulls in inter-desk swaps and includes all the features you guys have requested - sorts by delivery point or hour, able to refresh, etc.

I've saved the download as EOL Download (in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000) and deleted the file called NEW EOL DOWNLOAD. Test is out and let me know what you think.

Thanks.
