On Peak on Wednesday -

STWBOM will be 50 mw short @ NP15. Day-ahead price is $23.67. Please purchase to cover this under STWHOURLY (make all subsequent wheels and transmission deals under STWHOURLY as well), and make an inter-desk swap between the two books. 

Off Peak, sometime between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning -

We need to pay APS for transmission line losses - 3 mw off peak @ PV. Again, please purchase to cover this under the STWHOURLY book and sell @ $0 to Arizona Public Service Co. THIS NEEDS TO BE TAGGED. PLEASE PUT NOTES IN BOTH DEALS AND THE TAG TO INDICATE POWER IS BEING USED TO PAY BACK LINE LOSSES.

As always, please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
