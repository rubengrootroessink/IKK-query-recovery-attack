We are short at PGE system for Thursday and Friday, 9/27-28/01.  HE15-20pdt, we are 25mw short (total of 150mw short each day).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #791433.1 for both days.

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
