Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the second night,
but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a lot of people
had early flights out the next morning.

This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!  Or at least
some sleep.

What was the name of that band you were playing in your car?  I doubt I
can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

Have a great weekend!
Jen

	Jennifer,
	I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet
up the
	second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out
again on
	Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I
missed you.
	Talk to you soon.

	Clint
