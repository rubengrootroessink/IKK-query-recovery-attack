Residuals strike again!   Contributions from ALL have helped to once again throw great memories into the wind.  What a grand way to start Fall!  Thanks for those that sqooshed the beans 'tween their toes, extreme cooks, dessert visionaries, dishwashers, crepe makers, beach walkers, saggers and drivers.  And oh you hill climber/bike riders...   Memory makers all! 

Remember, you can NOT get this kind of service/savings at any HOTEL  6! 

things we learned:  wasps down our shirts are painful!  If your bike is not moving you will fall.  2 wrongs (lefts?) CAN make a right!  Stop to pee on the uphill or at the top!  the 'Draft' can be a good thing.  Shootin' stars, like the truth, 'is out there'.  Ibuprofen is your friend!  Now to take a moment for your own personal thoughts... 

OK---now for the cold hard facts, a drum roll please!  Attached is the spreadsheet as it currently stands.  If there are mistakes, omissions, overages, underages...just plain bad spreadsheetin' please to tell.  If your amount is in red or not in (  ) pay the piper.  If you are in the (black) the check is in the mail!   

some easy ones, Hansel, if you'd give 20 bones to Travis then you can pay me $5 and you are clear!  Todd, 10 bones to Rachel and I'm happy to call it  square.  Cathy and Matt, save your 4 quarters for ball markers when we all walk (stagger) the links at Edgefield!  Chris and Mike, we'll handle ours when rent comes due (ok?)...if spreadsheets are not your thing see below!    

We have much to be thankful for!  Peace and thanks to all for sharing these bounties and each other!      

Honored to be your 'grand poo-bah'            Billy

Tess too     cute   for   words.      On scholarship! 

When fall comes... 
The sun slants in so fine 
And the air's so clear 
You can almost hear the grapes grow on the vine 

The nights are sharp with starlight 
And the days are cool and clean 
And in the blue sky overhead 
The northern geese fly south instead 
And leaves are Irish Setter red 
When fall comes... 

When fall comes... 
And the wind blows off the sea 
Swallows fly in a perfect sky 
And the world was meant to be
