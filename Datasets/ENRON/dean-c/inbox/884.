FYI -

It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved. I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals. (Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand. This worksheet is.)

One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of "place holder." An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat.

If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question. If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes.
