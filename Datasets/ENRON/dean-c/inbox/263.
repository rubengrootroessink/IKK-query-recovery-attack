FYI--

The information below is an excellent overview of the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders.  However, all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have received a hard copy of the guidelines and procedures issued by Oregon Department Administrative Services.  This four-page document has detailed guidelines and instructions for mail/parcel handling.  If you would like to get a copy of these guidelines, ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy.  The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps, powdery substances, unusual written comments on envelopes, etc.  If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office, they will notify us as well as the proper authorities.

If you have any questions or concerns, please see me or Debra Davidson.

Subject:	Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats

We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word "Anthrax."
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.
