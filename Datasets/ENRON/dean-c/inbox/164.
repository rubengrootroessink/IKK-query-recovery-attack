Did anyone take care of Powerex cuts on Friday? 

I've entered a sale to Powerex to bookout for two hours in which they cut a preschedule (deal 795777/tag 16EV) and were unable to resupply the entire 25 mw. Sale is for HE 13 - 13 mw @ $46, and HE 21 - 6 mw @ $31. Prices are EPE's incremental costs for those hours, used per Steve at El Paso.

If any of you have more information about these cuts and how they should have been handled, please let me know.

FYI - Cuts were not handled correctly if Real Time Position Manager is not flat when you leave.
