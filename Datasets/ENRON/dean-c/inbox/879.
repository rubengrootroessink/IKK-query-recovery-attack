A hour ahead 24 has been sent to the ISO for 10.10.01.

HE 13-20

APX1 SP15 purchase increased by 25 MW
STCA SDG1 load decreased by 25MW

This was due to a scheduling problem which occurred with BPs (SC ID APX1) sale to STCA on 10.09.01
They preferred to schedule their sale hour ahead and we have agreed.  This will be a one time arrangement.  Thanks, Serena
