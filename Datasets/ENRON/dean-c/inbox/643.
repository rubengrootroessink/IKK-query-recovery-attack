In just a few days we have collected $400, that equals $1200 after the Enron match!  We will be accepting donations tomorrow at the picnic and again on Monday.

Please see me if you have any questions regarding the match or charities.

Thank you for your generosity.  

Mollie


In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>
NY Police and Fire Widows & Children Benefit Fund,  <http://www.nypfwc.org/>
