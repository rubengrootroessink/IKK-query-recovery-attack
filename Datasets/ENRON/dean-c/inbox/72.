Rahul,
	Per our conversation, please follow up with research and ake the following changes to the current model.  

		1). We want the model to use the desks hourly scalars. We also want to be able to differentiate the scalars for each year.  The current historical data the 		model uses is not applicable to the ERCOT market.

		2). We want to able to control the number of jump hours and days, and control the range of prices for those jumps for positive and negative pricing. We also 		would like to control this and change it for each individual year.

		3). Model must be capable of positive and negative pricing.


	Please get a timeline on when this can be completed.


Doug, if you have anything more that you want to be able to control in the model please let me know and I will make sure it gets done.

Regards,
Greg
