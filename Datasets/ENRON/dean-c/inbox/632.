We are short at PGE system for 9/21/01 and 9/22/01.  HE15-20pdt, we are 25mw short.  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  The sale deal number has not yet been input to the system, but I will send another note when it has.

Also, I failed to send a note for TODAY, 09/20/01.  We are short at Portland System for 8mw HE1-6, 23-34 and 25mw for HE15-20.  I was able to call RT in time for them to cover this morning.  LLH deal number is 781575.1 and Super peak number is 781576.1.  Sorry about the lapse for this one.


Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
