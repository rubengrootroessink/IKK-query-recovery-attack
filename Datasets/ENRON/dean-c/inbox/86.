To All:

Attached is the 2002 zone map that the ERCOT board approved.

Doug,  This one can replace the three zone map that you have on the "white board" on the floor.  I'm not sure of the new traders that have been added, so if you could please forward it to them.

David, I have forwarded this so that you know ERCOT is the original source.

Lance
