	I bought 8mw of SP15 from Gas recovery systems and built the purchase in CAPS with the APX.   It is 8mw HE 9-17 @29 dollars.  We also had Arco come back up and they need to be sold or used to cover a short, it is 26 mw in SP15 and the gen schedule is already built in CAPS for 10/24 and 10/25.  They are up around the clock and need to recieve fair market price for their generation.
