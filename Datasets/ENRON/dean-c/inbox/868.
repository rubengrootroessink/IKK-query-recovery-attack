Tomorrow, Grace begins her vacation to Hawaii (lucky gal!).  She will be out of the office for a little over a week.   During this time, I will also be out of the office for Assoc/Analyst recruiting for several days.  To insure that an HR resource will be available for you, Josie Jarnagin will be in our office for the next two weeks.

Josie worked with me at EBS as our HR Coordinator.  She is familiar with all of the Enron systems including payroll, SAP and Benefits.  Josie will be able to answer questions, problem-solve with you and help support our team.

Please drop by and say "Hello" to Josie.
