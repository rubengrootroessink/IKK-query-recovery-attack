Group,

Wheelabrator Martel (MARTEL_2_AMFOR), NP15, suffered an outage around 0630 PST Monday morning, 10/29.  They are expected to be down for the balance-of-Monday and for most of Tuesday.  They are prescheduled at 10mw for both days.  So please purchase 10mw for them for the remainder of Monday, and for most of Tuesday.  I will talk to whoever is on the Tuesday day shift regarding how long they need power for on Tuesday.

Thanks,
