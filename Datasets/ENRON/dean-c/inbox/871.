Please note - 

Kathy asked that we update our EPE distribution list. Suggestion - create a personal contact folder in Outlook called "El Paso" that includes the following e-mail addresses:

kpeterso@epelectric.com
tsoto@epelectric.com
sburac1@epelectric.com

Please let me know if you need help doing this.
