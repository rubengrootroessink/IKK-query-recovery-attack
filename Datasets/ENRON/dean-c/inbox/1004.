Kearney Recruits Terrific Class
Five of the nation's top prep track and field prospects, including four state
champions and one national high school record-holder, have signed with
Longhorn women's track coach Beverly Kearney.
The class is headed by four of the nation's top sprinters - Ychlindria Spears
of Luling, who also is the national record holder in the triple jump; Ashlee
Williams of Dallas Bishop Dunne, who also had the nation's top high hurdles
clocking last season; state Class 4A 100, 200 and triple jump champ LaToya
Phelps of Greenville; Florida sprint-jump star Sanya Richards of Fort
Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, and relay ace Sheretta Jones of Houston Forest
Brook.
"We are really excited about the class we have coming in for the 2003
season," Kearney said. "The quality of this class is phenomenal and this may
be one of the best we've put together since we've been here."
"Each athlete in this class is an exceptional signee, but together they take
it to a whole other level. They are competitive, mature and focused, and we
are extremely excited about the quality of individuals we are bringing into
the program."
Kearney's class is headlined by Spears, who was the 2001 Gatorade National
High School Girls' Track and Field Athlete of the Year as a junior.
The nation's top prep female jumper and a proven sprinter, Spears set a
national high school record in the triple jump with a 44-2 1/4 mark at the
2001 Texas 3A State Championships last May.
Besides winning the triple at last spring's state meet, Spears claimed gold
in the long jump and swept the 100- and 200-meter dashes on her way to
scoring all 40 of Luling's third-place points.
Her season-best long jump of 20-9 1/4 also led the nation last year, and she
went on to win the USATF Junior Nationals in the event with a wind-aided 20-9
3/4 effort.
She ended her junior season as the state's top performer in all
classifications in the long and triple jumps, No. 2 in the 200 (23.84) and
No. 5 in the 100 (11.64).
Prior to her junior year, Spears qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials
in the long jump where she finished 14th in her flight. Over the last three
years, Spears has won 11 out of a possible 12 gold medals at the state meet
and won over 40 events on the district, regional, state and national levels.
Spears is also an honor student, ranking in the top five percent of her class.
"Ychlindria is a phenomenal athlete who can add quality depth in the long
jump, triple jump and 100 immediately," Kearney said.
"She has all the tools necessary to be successful not only on the collegiate
level, but internationally as well. She is talented and versatile and we
think she is one of the most competitive athletes out there."
Williams is one of the top prep sprinter-hurdler prospects in the country. A
standout for Dallas Bishop Dunne High on the TAPPS 4A level, she has swept
state titles in the 200, 100 hurdles and 4x100 and 4x200 relay the last two
seasons in leading Bishop Dunne to consecutive team titles
Last March, Williams set a state record in the 100 hurdles with a
personal-best 13.23 clocking at the Texas Southern Invitational in Houston.
Last summer, she struck gold in the 100 hurdles at the USATF Junior Nationals
in Richmond, Va., and at the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, Calif.
She closed her junior season as the nation's top prep performer in the 100
hurdles and No. 15 in the 100 (11.67). Williams also posted the state's third
fastest time in the 200 (23.81) and the No. 7 time in the 100.
"Ashlee is one of the fastest hurdlers to come out in several years," Kearney
said. "She has the potential to develop into a great hurdler and sprinter.
She reminds me a lot of (former Longhorn track and field star) Angie Vaughn,
but she is much faster and more seasoned at this point."
Richards has been one of the top all-around track and field performers in the
Florida high school ranks for the past three years, making her mark in the
sprints and jumps. She has led St. Thomas Aquinas to three consecutive
Florida 3A State Championships, the most recent coming last spring when she
grabbed gold in the 100, long jump and 4x100 relay and silver in the 400.
At the 2000 state meet, Richards swept the 100, 200, long jump and 4x100
relay to lead her team to a convincing 110-point win. On the national level
last summer, Richards swept the 100 and 200 at the USATF Junior Olympics and
placed fourth in the 400 at the Adidas Outdoor Championships in Raleigh, N.C.
Indoors, she was second in the 200 and third in the 60 at the New York Armory
NSIC last March.
She finished her season ranked No. 6 nationally  in the 200 (23.57) and long
jump (19-11 1/2), No. 7 in the 400 (53.47) and No. 8 in the 100 (11.59).
"Sanya is the youngest member of this class, but she is a soldier," Kearney
said. "She is a team all wrapped up by herself, because she can do so many
different things."
Phelps , who also a standout basketball player, won the 100 in 11.55, the 200
in 23.8 and the triple jump  with a 42-8 1/4 leapat the 2001 Texas 4A State
Meet.
She won district titles in the 100, 200, 4x200 relay, long jump and triple
jump and regional titles in the 100, 200 and triple jump. Her personal-best
triple jump of 42-8 1/4 ranked No. 2 nationally at the end of her junior
season.
"LaToya may be the sleeper of this class," Kearney said. "She is a phenomenal
athlete and an excellent basketball player. She won three state titles last
year as a junior, and she is one of the top triple jumpers in the country."
Jones has been one of the state's top quarter-milers as a member of perennial
power Houston Forest Brook's track and field teams the past two years. She
won district and regional titles in the 400, with a best time of 55.5, on her
way to finishing fourth in the quarter at the Texas 4A State Championships
last May.
She also helped the school's 4x400 relay squad to the district title and
runner-up finishes at the regional and state meets. As a sophomore, she
finished third in the 400 and 4x400 relay at the state meet.
"Sheretta has done an outstanding job for Forest Brook on the relays and in
the sprints," Kearney said. "I look at her open performances and I think
she'll be able to contribute right away. She reminds me of (current Longhorn)
Raasin McIntosh, and we think she can end up being as good as anyone."

UT Men Sign Great Track Class
Five top high school recruits, headed by Austin Reagan High sprinter Brendan
Christian, plus one All-American transfer from Arkansas, have signed with
Longhorn men's trackcoach Bubba Thornton. The NCAA track and field signing
period started last Wednesday and extends through this Wednesday.
In addition to Christian, the Longhorn track signees include twin brothers
Aaron and Ashton Collins of New Orleans Clark, Nicholas Johnson of Fort Worth
Wyatt, Joe Thorne of Atlanta Lakeview)and the Arkansas transfer - Jason Ward
of Tilgham HS in Paducah, Ky.
Christian is one of the nation's top sprinters in the 100 and 200, where he
holds the state Class 4A record with a 20.56 clocking at the State Meet last
May, and he also has run a 45.5 leg on Reagan's 1,600-meter relay team.
Johnson, the younger brother of Longhorn senior sprinter Amar Johnson, is
another top sprinter with a 10.33 100 meters clocking. The Collins brothers
are outstanding in the longer sprints, Thorne is one of nation's top
performers in the distance races and the steeplechase, and Ward is already
established as one of the top triple jumpers at the collegiate level.
"In our minds, this is one of the top classes in the nation," Thornton said.
"Each athlete has an immediate chance to contribute to our program next year.
They can have a national impact for us right away, not just in their
performances but as leaders as well."
"Each individual has great qualities, and we're excited about this class as a
whole," he said. "They all are aware of the national scene and are looking
forward to competing against NCAA-caliber athletes."
Christian, one of the top three or four sprinters in the country, is the
defending Texas Class 4A state champion and record holder in the 200-meter
dash, as well as anchoring  Reagan's regional champion 4x100 and 4x400 relay
teams.
Christian also won 100-meter title last summer at the Adidas Outdoor Track &
Field Championships in Raleigh, N.C., and Golden West Invitational in
Sacramento, Calif. He set the national high school indoor record in the 200
(21.02) at the New York Armory NSIC in March. He  also won the 60 at that
meet and swept the 55 and 200 at the Arkansas National High School
Invitational in January. Christian enters his senior season ranked No. 2
nationally in the 200 (20.56) and No. 4 in the 100 (10.40).
Johnson is a Texas 4A district and regional 100-meter champion for perennial
track power Fort Worth Wyatt. In addition to finishing fourth at last year's
state track meet in the 100, Johnson also ran legs on the Chaparrals'
district champion and state runner-up 4x100-meter relay squad which ended the
season with the second-fastest time in the country (40.39). He ranks in the
national top 10 in the 100 (10.33w) as he enters the 2002  season.
The Collins twins have been stars on the Louisiana track and field scene for
the last three years for New Orleans Clark High. Ashton was a five-time 4A
state champion last year, winning titles in the 400 (indoor and outdoor),
800, 4x200 and 4x400 relay.
He also placed fourth in the quarter at the Golden West Invitational last
summer, and is the No. 2-ranked returning quarter-miler in the nation
(46.29). Aaron won three state crowns last year in the 200, 4x200 and 4x400
relay.
Thorne won the Georgia 5A individual cross country title in leading his
Lakeside High team to a fourth-place finish at the state meet on Nov. 3. He
also posted the second-fastest 5k time in the country this season with a time
of 14:41 at the Alexander Invitational on Oct. 6.
Thorne is the defending state champion in the 1,600 and 3,200, posting the
state's top times in both events last season. Against some of the top runners
in the country, he finished fourth in his first-ever 2,000-meter steeplechase
at the 2001 Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships.
He also placed 12th at the 2000 Foot Locker National Cross Country
Championship in Raleigh, and is one of the favorites to challenge for the
South Regional and National crowns this year.
Ward, the sophomore transfer from Arkansas, was an All-American and All-SEC
performer in the triple jump as a freshman. He skipped to a personal-best
mark of 54-6 to become the national runner-up at the 2000 NCAA Indoor
Championships in Fayetteville, Ark.
He also finished fourth at the SEC Championships with a 52-2 3/4 effort. At
Paducah Tilgham High, Ward was a five-time All-American in track and field.
He also won the triple jump at the USATF Junior Nationals in 1999.
