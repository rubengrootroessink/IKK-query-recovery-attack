As you know, announcements about the change to our Savings Plan Administrator (401k) have been populating your in-box.  Here's another one!

If you would like to make changes to your allocations or move funds within the Plan, you will need to make these changes TODAY before 1:00 PM (Pacific), 3:00 PM (Central). If you have any questions, you may contact Karla Dobbs, at 713) 345-7880, our contact for the savings plan.  

Let me us if you have any other questions.

Thanks!
