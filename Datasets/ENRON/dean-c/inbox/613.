We are short at PGE system for 9/19/01.  HE15-18pdt, we are 25mw short.  HE 19-20pdt, we are 26mw short.  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  The sale deal number is 779466.1.

Also, Sean Crandall indictated he would be providing Bill Williams III with more information.

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
