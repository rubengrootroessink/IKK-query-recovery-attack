Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture 
Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of "impeccable creditworthiness" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.
