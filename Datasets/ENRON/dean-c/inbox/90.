Recruiting Roundup

The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky
at this time.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas, but is setting up
visits to Oklahoma (he was once committed to the Sooners) and several other
schools.
WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael
Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week, but then they both
decommitted.
Williams attended Texas A&M's game Saturday and plans to come to take an
official visit to Texas the December 14 weekend.
* * * *
The Longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or
more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year. However, he injured a
knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a
lot of academic ground to cover to graduate.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,
5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
The Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of
them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent
Young of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of
Houston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony
Wright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of
Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,
Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey
Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and
Lindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool
of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
If the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four
top players on my 25-man "difference-maker" list.
They already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.
1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.
If Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the
leader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.
The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at
kicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the
best I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five
yards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.
* * * *
INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many
years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. Consider this item
in last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50
national  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled "8
Players to watch:
"Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something
special."

Game Quotes . .

"We were able to spread the field today because (tight end) Bo Scaife made
some great catches and that opened things up. I think Bo gives us the ability
to stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the
defense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris
(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half."
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on
the ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting
some three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it
up. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai
Pearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin
Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we
decided to give him the primary coverage on him."
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our
offensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told
me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep
running and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the
record book."
- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he
is the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at
Texas
* * * *
"I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was
getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and
our wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to
them."
- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones
for 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns
* * * *
"We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA
(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day."
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
"When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the
Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game
came as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS."
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams
* * * *
"He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen
this year."
- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin
Jammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards

Key Statistics

Missouri had 10 possessions and five of them were three-and-out series, while
another gained only four yards in four plays and ended with an interception.
The Tigers also started both halves with terrible offensive statistics,
making zero first downs in the first quarter and one first down in the third
quarter.

Scouting Baylor

Texas will play at Baylor at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a game that will be
televised by Fox Syndication.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 5  in both polls, are 7-1, while the Bears are 2-5.
Texas is a 34-point favorite.
Baylor has lost five straight after opening the season with a 24-3 victory
over Arkansas State and a 16-13 win over New Mexico.
The Bears then lost to Iowa State, 41-0; Texas A&M 16-10; Nebraska, 48-7;
Oklahoma, 33-17, and Texas Tech, 63-19.
QB Greg Cicero, a former Longhorn, is the Bears' main offensive threat
As you can see from the teams' respective national rankings below, Baylor has
had trouble running the ball. There are 115 Division 1 teams playing football
and the Bears are 113th in rushing and also 113th in total offense and 112th
in scoring.
The Baylor defense has been tough at times, particulary in the 16-10 loss to
A&M.
But this is a game the Longhorns should win easily. Look for RB Cedric Benson
to extend his UT true freshman record of three straight 100-yard rushing
games to four and look for QB Chris Simms to have a great day.
It also should be a good day for the Longhorn defense to get back in the top
10 nationally.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                    Baylor

Longhorn Notes . .
