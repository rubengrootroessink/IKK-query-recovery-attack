FYI -

We will be paying back line losses to APS tomorrow @ 4C - 1 mw @ HE 6, 1 mw @ HE 11. I've gone ahead and prescheduled this payback to ensure that it gets tagged. All you have to do is make sure this makes it into the El Paso model (EPE is the source). Following are the deal and tag numbers, just in case.....

Deals - 800427/800467
Tag - 34307

Again, no need to do anything for this. Just put in in the model. And let me know if you have questions.
