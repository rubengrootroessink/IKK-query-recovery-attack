This confirms that EPMI Real Time will be selling 4 MW at NP-15 to Wheelabrator Martell and reducing the generation pre-schedule from 13 MW to 9 MW effective HE 17 on 9/25 through HE12 on 9/26.  We expect that Martell might need to continue this purchase through at least HE 17 on 9/26, but Dave Ferguson will call Stan or me tomorrow to clarify exactly which hours are needed.  After this event Dave can call Stan  to obtain info on the price paid.

Thanks
