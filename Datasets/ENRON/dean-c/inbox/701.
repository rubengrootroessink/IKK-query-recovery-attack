RT Traders,

As of Oct. 1, 2001 Grays Harbor Paper is no longer available for merchant sales as they are now under a long term contract with Grays Harbor PUD.

Over the weekend 9/28 - 9/30 Morrow Power may call to have the RT group sell hourly between 22 - 25 Mw's. This is a new Gas fired unit located in Boardman. I've put a sheet in the Services book showing the account numbers for transmission. Morrow needs to sell at the best price but their costs are between $21 - $23.00.

Morrow Power is a valid conterparty in Enpower.

Feel free to call me if there are any questions.

Regards,

Les Rawson
