How was your Thanksgiving in Dallas?  I had a great time in San Antonio!
Especially Friday after Texas won!  Not the best game played, but we
beat them!  How is the new building?  Glad to hear the rumors have
stopped.  That can be so stressful.  Hope all is well with you.  I work
nights this week (imagine that?).  Coming back after two weeks off is
always so HARD!

Jen

What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has
happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the
rumors
have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not
sure
how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger
will
get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So
there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As
far
as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they
bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little
better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are
supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will
be
interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.

   Hey there!  How are things down in Houston?  I can't imagine the
rumors
   that are going on there.  We were so busy here last week.  I am ready
   for my two weeks off.  I am going to S.A. for Thanksgiving (did I
   already mention that?).  I am not sure if I want to fly with what
   happened today?  It's crazy out there, but I have to get home to
Texas.
   I hope you have a great time in Dallas and I'll chat with ya when I
get
   back.

      I definitely dressed up for the party.  I looked good!  I was a
   sheriff.
      If you can't find that CD up there, you can always pick it up
   back in
      Texas.  So, I'm trying to remember, does your mom live in
   Houston, and dad
      in S.A.?  Is that right?  I'm going to Dallas for Thanksgiving,
   and I'm
      just glad I don't have to fly.  I can't imagine what the lines
   will be like
      that week.  I'm off work this Friday, so if you get a chance to
   call,
      better make it Thursday.  Glad to hear that you're feeling
   better.  Talk to
      you soon.

         Hey there!  How was your Halloween party?  Did you dress up?
   I hung out
         with some friends, but no costumes.  Dexter Freebish - that's
   it.  I'll
         have to look for it up here.  We went to the APB party, but
   left early
         to get some food.  Things calmed down that last night
   compared to
         Tuesday.

         I'll be back on days at the end of next week and then I'll
   have two
         weeks off.  I cannot wait!  What are your plans for
   Thanksgiving?  I'm
         flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days.  I
   can't decide
         whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas.
   I feel so
         lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

         I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
   lost my
         voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
   Needless
         to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
   everyone was
         happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
   other than
         the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

         Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
   office on
         Thursday.

            I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the
   APB
         party at
            Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those
   days
         about 3
            years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day
   weekend,
         and are
            back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for
   the band
         I was
            playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there,
   but it
         was
            probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from
   Austin.
         You need
            to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a
   Halloween
         party this
            weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you
         planning any
            more trips back to Houston?

            Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the
   second
         night,
            but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a
   lot of
         people
            had early flights out the next morning.

            This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!
   Or
         at least
            some sleep.

            What was the name of that band you were playing in your
   car?  I
         doubt I
            can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

            Have a great weekend!

                 Jennifer,
                 I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't
   get to
         meet
            up the
                 second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you
   go
         out
            again on
                 Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I
   guess
         I
            missed you.
                 Talk to you soon.

                 Clint
