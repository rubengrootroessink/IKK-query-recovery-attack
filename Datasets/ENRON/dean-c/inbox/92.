Hey, just wanted to let you know that Melissa was induced this morning and
baby Lauren should be here sometime later this afternoon.  I'm not sure if
you are on her email list but I will forward any pictures I get on to you.
Hope you had a good weekend, sounds like you're definitely living the high
life with all the single girls!  How fun!  :)
I, on the other hand, am picking out baby furniture & decorations....crazy
isn't it?
Well, take care and I'll talk with you soon.

-Amy
