Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which affected the following deals:

275298	Jan-00			modified option premium
288187		Feb-00			modified option premium
300368	Mar-00			modified option premium
316345		Apr-00			modified option premium
331019		May-00			modified option premium
347153		Jun-00			modified option premium
425790	Dec-00 through Feb-01 modified annuity strips
397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips

What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed through to your systems?  Does everything prior to the current month need to be auto-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?

Thanks!

Andrea
