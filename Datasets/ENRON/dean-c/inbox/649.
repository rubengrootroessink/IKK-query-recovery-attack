As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. 

This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions:

1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.

2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.

3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.

If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help.
