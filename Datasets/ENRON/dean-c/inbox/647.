We are short at PGE system for Tuesday, 9/25/01.  HE1-6 , 15-20, and 23-24pdt, we are 25mw short (total of 350mw short).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #787190.1


Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk
