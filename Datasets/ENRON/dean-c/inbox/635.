FYI -

We'll need to pay APS back for transmission line losses incurred on 9/17. Please send them 3 mw during one heavy load hour tomorrow - losses were incurred HE 8, but may be paid back at anytime on-peak. They need the energy delivered at either PV or 4C. Make purchase and sale under STWHOURLY, and please tag this payback as well. Let me know the relevant deal & tag numbers, and I will convey these to APS.

Thanks.
