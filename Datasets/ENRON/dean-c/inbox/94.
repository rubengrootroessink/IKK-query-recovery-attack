I have taken the email that Connie and Trish forwarded to us and broken
it down into direct questions.  Dave Odle will be preparing the hig
level comparison of Version 1.3 to Version 1.4. (minor, major and new).
If you have time to respond to these items (by company) by 3:00 p.m.,
tomorrow,  I will try to consolidate and have them prepared for display
and discussion.  Thanks.
