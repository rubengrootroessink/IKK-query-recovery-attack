Well, of course we have our get together with my family on Thanksgiving Day
but that's about it.
So, maybe we can go to dinner that Friday or Saturday.  Would that work for
you?  Let's just finalize things closer to time.  Have a good day!

-Amy

Thanks for the pics.  I hope they are doing well.  I will be up there for
Thanksgiving.  I don't know how much y'all have going on that weekend, but
I would like to get together if possible.  Just let me know what you are
thinking.
