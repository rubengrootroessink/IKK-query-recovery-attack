I'm impressed.  I'm starting to get calls/emails asking if we are still on.
Usually you guys don't plan anything until one hour before.  So, I
congratulate you all on this big step.

We are on for December 7 and 8.

In any event, this is the final list of people that are definitely coming.
We are at 15 counting the email list above plus two additional people that
Palmer is bringing.  Paul Park's room-mate may be coming as well.

Remember to get directions for the website below before you head out.  BTW,
the directions are pretty iffy.  So, you will want to look at a map before
you get in your car.  Also, cell phones don't work too well out there, so
don't try to rely on calling us once you get lost.

What to bring:  Bedding is supplied.  But we now have 15 people potentially
in on this thing.  If memory serves, the house can sleep 15 and bedding
should be available.  I think 5 people should plan on bringing the
just-in-case sleeping bag.  I'll bring one.  That leaves 4 others for you
all to decide.  Bring all your booze and ice for the weekend and cups to
drink out of.  It's next to impossible to find this stuff out there.  You
also want to bring your baffroom stuff and warm clothes for drinking outside
at night.   You will also want lighter (not summer) clothes for daytime
stuff.  There's fishing/country golf/hiking available in the area.  So,
bring what equipment you want to.  Each car should bring a cooler with ice
in it.  You also will want your food for the weekend.  Bring what you want,
but popular meals are steaks at night and sandwiches during the day.  I
specifically like to get steak blood all over my face and chase
vegetarian-Summitt around.  Mostly, you shouldn't need to bring too much.

Cost:  Plan on about $40 for the cabin per person.  Plan on another $20 per
person for firewood.  This has gone up because we're buying lots and towing
it down.  Stupid...yes.  Fun...yes.  You may also want to have a little more
just-in-case cash.

When to arrive.  The hills are pretty difficult driving at night, and if you
haven't ever been before, the cabin itself is difficult to find at night.
So, if at all possible, try to get a half-day off or so on Friday to get you
out there by sundown on Friday night.  You may want to call the cabin office
and get specific directions before-hand regardless of what time you plan on
arriving.  We will likely leave somewhat early on Sunday.

Palmer, can you bring lanterns, lantern fuel, etc.  Clint/Koppa, can you
bring a case of Duraflam logs (yes, we cheat)?  Summitt and I will be towing
the trailer down.  Palmer, you may want to grab a little firewood that day
if we are running late.

I hope this answers everything.  Let me know if it does not.  Looking
forward to it.
