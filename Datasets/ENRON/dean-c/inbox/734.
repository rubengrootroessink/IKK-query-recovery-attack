An afternoon of PBR and Pumpkins... how could life get any better?!

To celebrate the passing of summer into fall (and to get rid of this keg
of beer that just doesn't seem to fit on our boat) Nick and I would like
to announce that this weekend we will be hosting our first annual--

                                                SAUVIE ISLAND HARVEST
BBQ!

Please join us in the festivities at Parker's Marina, this Sunday,
October 7, on Sauvie Island.  Weather-pending, the BBQ will begin at 3
pm, but you are most certainly welcome to head to the island earlier to
stock up on pumpkins, corn stalks, and fresh autumn produce.  The
pumpkin patches on Sauvie are open for business...and most are u-pick,
so make sure to dress accordingly. We'll tap the keg at one (for those
of you who think you'd pick a prettier pumpkin while sauced), and
probably be out picking pumpkins ourselves until 2 pm or so.  

We'll provide the brew, the grillables (including veggie options) and
some salads-- but also feel free to bring your favorite potluck dish.
We'd also suggest bringing lawn chairs (of some variety), as seating
otherwise would be on the grass.  If Nick can get the dinghy up and
running before the weekend- free dinghy rides for the kids (and yes,
phil, you too.)  

Getting to our place is easy.  Sea kayakers can paddle to our place up
the Willamette river, then into the Multnomah Channel. Cyclists, from
downtown Portland to the island, can follow Hwy. 30 for a nice and easy
30 mile ride round-trip.  Drivers, directions are listed below.   

Hope everyone can make it.  Spouses, dogs, kids, roommates and
significant others are all welcome!  Please pass this message along to
friends whose email addresses I don't have, and most certainly feel free
to bring new friends too.  The more, the merrier. 

Keeping my fingers crossed for one more weekend of sun.  Hasta pronto--
amy

If coming from I-5, going North or South:   Exit at the St. Helens exit

following signs toward St. Helens and Hwy 30.  Once on Hwy 30, you will
be heading west toward the coast.  Follow Hwy 30 for roughly 10 miles

a sign for Sauvie Island on your right, approximately 1 mile from the
turn-off.  There's a stop light at the turn off. Turn right onto the
island (you can only turn right) cross over the bridge, and follow the
road as it veers left (see map attached).  Keep straight after the veer
in the road and go approx. 2 miles (pass the Cracker Barrel on your
left, and Kruegers on your right.  The road will split and you can
either go straight or follow a bend to the right.  Go straight-
