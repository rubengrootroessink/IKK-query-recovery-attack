Horns Get Great JC Punter; Brown Says Team Will Bounce Back

Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says his punter, Brian Bradford,
"will
punt in the NFL someday. He's the best one I've ever been around."
That's good because Bradford committed to the Longhorns Sunday night.
Langston, who played and later coached at Oklahoma, said, "He's better than
any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there. He averages better than
43 yards and he gets tremendous hang time, in the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 (second)
range, which is really outstanding. He really gets great height and great
distance."
Langston said Bradford "is our team's most valuable player. He's one of the
those guys who  turns the field over. He really changes field position."
Bradford told me he has "always wanted to play for the Longhorns." He was a
full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas
in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns.
He is the Longhorns' 17th commitment, but he can be counted against last
year's class because he will enroll at mid-year.

Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorn coaches are "going to look at
personnel across the board" to try to find players who can help get the
team
back on the winning track.
Brown said the 63-14 loss to Oklahoma  was "my worst day as a coach,"  but
he
said he has to get the team playing well in a hurry to have a chance to
beat
Colorado in Boulder Saturday. He also said he expects the team to bounce
back
strongly.
"My job this week is to be hard, be tough, but to give them some hope," he
said. "This is the wrong week to be going to Boulder. They changed
quarterbacks and he (freshman Craig Ochs) played great at A&M. Colorado
also
has the best offensive line we've played this year. It's going to be a big
challenge."
Brown also said the Longhorns need to develop an identity on offense. He
said
he wants to be able to run the ball better, but said the Horns have done
better from the shotgun with four wideouts than with anything else they
have
tried this year.
He also hinted he might quit using his two-quarterback system, but said the
coaches always talk to the players before making any statement to the
press.
The Buffs are a 1-point favorite, and Brown said the Longhorns, who have
"played well in our stadium and played poorly away from it," need to play
their best game of the season to win.
He said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a sprained
ankle, is much better and probably will be able to play Saturday.
All America DT Casey Hampton said getting Rogers back would really help the
defense. "When Shaun is in there, it makes us a lot better," Hampton said.
Hampton and Rogers draw frequent double-team blocks, which frees the
defensive ends and linebackers to make more plays. With Rogers out, OU was
able to double-team both Hampton and DE Corey Redding at times Saturday by
using a back to help with the block on Redding.

The Longhorns' home game with Missouri next week will be an early afternoon
or night game. The TV networks are allowed to wait six days before a game
to
make their selections three times each year, and they exercised one of
those
options on the Texas-Missouri game. That game is one of three vying for two
TV spots, one at 2:30 p.m. and one at 6 p.,m. If  it isn't picked for TV,
it
probably will start at noon or 1 p.m.

RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch  says he probably
will announce his college choice later this week. He said Texas and LSU are
the main contenders, with Colorado and Tennessee also in the mix. "I'm
going
to call all the coaches and talk to them one last time to hear they have to
say," he said. Nordgren has been a strong Texas lean for several weeks, but
he also is very interested in LSU
