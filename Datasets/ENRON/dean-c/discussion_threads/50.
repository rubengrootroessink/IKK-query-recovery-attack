Brown Says Offensive Line Much Improved, Cites Other Problems Heading into
2-a-Days

Coach Mack Brown says he and his assistant coaches have thoroughly reviewed
the tapes of the Longhorns 15 spring practices and have concluded it was a
very productive period.
The offensive line has received much of the blame for the late-season
Longhorn swoon last year, but Brown says the offensive linemen, as a group,
showed a lot more maturity and perseverance in the spring.
"I think the offensive line improved a lot," he told me in an interview las=
t
week.
Asked what he thought prompted the improvement, he said, "The embarrassment
they felt leaving the Cotton Bowl and the fact that they have been together=
 a
year more."
While he didn't elaborate on the maturity question, it is worth noting that
four of the five offensive linemen who started in the spring have never
redshirted.
The reason they never redshirted is the lack of  depth in the offensive lin=
e
when they got here, which forced Brown to play most of the linemen when the=
y
were true freshmen.
At Nebraska, which has been the top program in the Big 12 year in and year
out, all offensive linemen redshirt and most of them don't start until thei=
r
fourth year when they are redshirt juniors.
Applying that yardstick to the Texas' offensive line, none of the four spri=
ng
starters would have started last year, and only senior LT Leonard Davis and
junior center Matt Anderson would start this year because they are entering
their fourth seasons.
There are exceptions, even at Nebraska, because their center last season wa=
s
a third-year sophomore, but the Huskers =01) and the other teams who seem t=
o
always be in the hunt for the national championship =01) go mostly with
fourth-and-fifth-year players (redshirted juniors and seniors) in their
offensive lines.
The five offensive line starters at Nebraska this spring already have 18
seasons in the Husker program under their belts. The Longhorns' five spring
starters have 11.
The Longhorns should be able to able to overcome their youth to some extent
because four of the spring starters =01) Davis, Anderson, junior RG Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and junior RT Mike Williams =01) all started last season, and
sophomore LG Derrick Dockery played often and well last year as a true
freshman.
That means they know what it takes to win and have the experience to help
them do it.
Brown did say he thinks the Longhorns can redshirt their offensive line
recruits this year "if we can avoid injuries." That bodes well for the futu=
re.
But, when the Horns start 2-a-days in early August, Brown said there are fo=
ur
problem areas where major improvements must be made for the Longhorns to be
able to compete at the highest level =01) and only one of them directly inv=
olves
the offensive line.
"First, he said, "we need to do a better job of net punting."
"Second, we need to do a better job returning punts and kickoffs."
"Third, we need to do a better job of making four-yard plays consistently o=
n
offense. That will help with ball control and will help take the pressure o=
ff
our passing game."
"Fourth, we need to do better job of getting a good pass rush out of our
front four."
The Longhorns made a lot of progress in the spring in each of those areas,
but Brown said they have to keep working hard in each area to get even bett=
er.
Former walk-on Ryan Long, who handled the punting last season, and Kris
Stockton, the Horns' regular place kicker, both worked hard on punting duri=
ng
the spring and both were able to get good heighth and good distance on most
of their kicks.
But look for incoming freshman punter Justin Smith to get a chance to win t=
he
starting job.
Even more improvement was shown in the spring in the other three areas.
CB Ahmad Brooks showed promise as a punt returner in the spring and redshir=
t
freshman RB Ivan Williams looked very good as a kickoff returner.
They should enable the Horns to be  better in both kick return areas if the=
y
improve as much during 2-a-days as they did in the 15 spring practices.
Williams also is the main hope of showing improvement in problem area No. 3=
 =01)
doing a better job of making consistent four-yard gains. He is a 235-pounde=
r
with speed and power and he can catch the ball, too.
One important thing to remember about big running backs, in addition to the
obvious characteristics, is the fact that offensive linemen tend to block
better for them because they want to get out of their way.
If you ever played in the offensive line at any level and had a big running
back step on the back of your legs because you didn't get out of his way,
you'll know why they make an extra effort to get a good block when they kno=
w
a 235-pounder is coming through their area.
While the coaches saw some things they liked in those first three areas, No=
.
4 =01) getting a better pash rush out of the front four =01) was a big-time=
 winner
the spring and should get even better during the pre-season practices.
Why? For starters, the best pair of tackles in all of college football retu=
rn
in seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers. Hampton is a returning
All-American and Rogers is rated even higher by the pro scouts.
Rogers is a great pass rusher and Hampton, the team's best run stopper, is =
a
good one.
And sophomore end Cory Redding is a future All-American who is an outstandi=
ng
pass rusher, and, while the coaches aren't satisfied the play of the guys a=
t
the other end, all three of them =01) Jermain Anderson, Maurice Gordon and =
Adam
McConathy =01) are very good at rushing the passer. Their problem is holdin=
g up
against the run.
So, while the Longhorns have work to do to reach the playing level the
coaches demand, they have a very good chance to do a lot better in all of t=
he
categories Brown mentioned except net punting, and they should be able to
show some improvement there because it isn't too hard to improve on a 29-ya=
rd
net punting average that ranked 111th of 114 teams playing Division I
football.
Here's what Brown had to say on several other subjects:
Do you expect Major Applewhite to be ready to go full speed when practice
starts in early August? Doctors usually say it takes about nine months and =
he
was operated on in mid-January, so he'll only have about seven months until
practice starts.
"I don't know," he said. "I've been around long enough, and I've had five o=
f
them (knee operations) myself, to know that sometimes you seem to be ahead =
of
schedule and then things seem to go a little slower. There are still some
questions and concerns there and we'll just have to wait and see."
After studying the film of the 15 spring practices, who were your most
pleasant surprises?
"There were a lot of pleasant surprises. Beau Baker had a good spring and i=
s
challenging Matt Anderson at center. We expected (redshirt freshman) Artie
Ellis to be pretty good, but he really jumped out and showed he has the
potential to help at wide receiver."
"Ivan Williams probably came farther than anybody. Matt Trissel had a good =
spr
ing at fullback. Leonard Davis had his best spring, by far (at offensive
tackle)."
"On defense, Jermain Anderson came back at 228 pounds and in good health an=
d
he looked good at end. We're working to get him a little bigger. D. D. Lewi=
s
had by far his best spring (at middle linebacker) and Reed Boyd, backing hi=
m
up, had a great spring, too."
"Quentin Jammer had a real good spring until he got hurt, but he looked
really good at corner. Dakarai Pearson looked real good at free safety."
"It wasn't any surprise, but those two defensive tackles are real good,"
"What's your biggest concern about having to play 11 straight games without
an open date?
"We're going to have to play a lot of people. We felt like we got worn down
last year at the end of the season, and we've worked to build better depth =
so
we can play more people. We're going to do that to try to keep our people
fresher."
Let's talk about the chances of some of those heralded freshman wide
receivers helping out early.
"Well, a guy can play there quicker. It's less physical than most of the
other positions. The main thing will be learning how to handle the
bump-and-ran coverage. We're telling them to come in ready to compete for
playing time."

Hall Will Transfer

Redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall has asked for and has been granted an
unconditional release and plans to transfer to another school this summer.
Hall, an Austin Westlake product, was the backup to sophomore Chris Simms
during spring practice while junior Major Applewhite was recovering from
major knee surgery.
He had a very good spring, and was really adept at throwing on the run.
His departure will leave the Longhorns with just three scholarship
quarterbacks this season =01) Applewhite, Simms and incoming freshman Chanc=
e
Mock of The Woodlands.
And that is based on the assumption that Applewhite's knee will be strong
enough to allow him to be ready at the start of the season.
"It was a difficult decision, but one that I think is the best for me at th=
is
time," Hall said. "The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to b=
e
a starter in the near future."
"I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff
have done for me, but I think I will have a better opportunity to play soon=
er
at another school."
"Obviously we are disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring
and we have been very pleased with his progress," Brown said.
"We wish him the very best and appreciate everything he has done for the
University of Texas and its football program."

Revisiting the Offense

After looking at the statistics of all of last season's game, I feel much
better about the Texas offense.
Through the first 11 games last season, UT was averaging 448 yards a game a=
nd
had the league's second-ranked offense. Texas also had been outgained only
once, in the  win over Nebraska.
But QB Major Applewhite was healthy and WRs Kwame Cavil and Ryan Nunez were
teaming up to outgain 1998's dynamic duo of Wane McGarity and Cavil. Jeremy
Jones was also providing quality time at WR.
Against good defenses, they were the straws that stirred the Longhorn offen=
se.
When the offensive meltdown occurred in the last three games, injuries to
Nunez and Jones, Applewhite's illness before the A&M game and Cavil's
suspension before the Arkansas game kept them from ever being being all
together again.
Fear of those potent weapons had kept teams from blitzing effectively, but,
with one or more of those weapons missing in each of last three games, team=
s
were able to blitz too many people to block without fear of getting burned
deep.
I doubt Texas could have beaten Nebraska a second time in one year, but I'd
like to have played A&M and Arkansas with everybody healthy.
It's true that those receivers are gone, but TE Bo Scaife and a bigger,
faster corps of WRs will make all-out blitzing much more dangerous for othe=
r
teams. Look for a return to those 400-plus-yard offensive averages in 2000.

The Pre-Season Blue Chips

Here's my revised list of the top Texas football recruits. The ones in bold
type are my early Fabulous 40. I decided to run the list again this month
because there are so many changes in the wake of the Nike camps and early
college scouting. I also trimmed the list from 100 to 80 because I wanted t=
o
limit it to kids who are being heavily recruited by Division I schools.
(Note to E-Mail Subscribers: I have put four asterisks (****) between the F=
ab
40 and Elite 80 guys at each position)

Mihm Turns Pro; Barnes Cupboard Far from Bare

All-America center Chris Mihm announced Friday he is passing up his senior
season at Texas to follow his life-long dream of playing in the NBA.
"It was a tough choice because I love the program at UT, but I believe I'm
doing what makes the most sense," Mihm said.
Mihm, who led the Longhorns in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots last
season, is projected as a top five pick in the NBA draft next month.
If  Mihm had returned for his senior season, the Longhorns probably would
have been a pre-season top 10 team, but coach Rick Barnes' cupboard if far
from bare and they should be a top 20 team without him.
Among the six returning lettermen are 6-8 junior forward Chris Owens, a pow=
er
in the paint, and 6-3 senior guard Darren Kelly, a sharpshooter and strong
defender.
Other lettermen include sophomore forward William Wyatt, sophomore guard/fo=
rwa
rd Chris Ogden, sophomore guard Roosevelt Brown and senior guard Chris
McColpin.
But Barnes' ace in the hole is transfer guard Maurice Evans, a 6-5 junior
dynamo who practiced with the team last season after averaging 22.6 points =
a
game as a sophomore at Wichita State.
Evans has been very impressive in practice and he, like Mihm, has big-time
NBA potential. Barnes' offense is not as wide open as Wichita State's, but
look for Evans to average 16 or 17 points a game and be one of the team's b=
ig
guns, offensively and defensively, next season.
Barnes also has six recruits coming in, including heralded JC point guard
Freddie Williams, plus four national top 100 recruits in 6-9 forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville, 6-8 forward James Thomas of Hargrave Military
Academy in Chatham, Virginia, 6-5 swingman Brandon Mouton of Lafayette, La.=
,
and 6-10, 255-pound center
Jason Klotz of Houston Klein Forest.
Guard Lawrence Williams announced plans to transfer two weeks ago and Barne=
s
filled the scholarship by signing Royal Ivey, a 6-3, 175-pound guard from
Blair Academy, a prep school in Blairstown, N. J.
Joe Montegna, Ivey's coach at Blair, said the Longhorns picked up a real ge=
m.
"He averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists for us," Montegna said.
"He's a fine offensive player who is a true combo guard, but he's much bett=
er
on defense."
He's the best defensive player, by far, that I've ever coached, and I've
coached in the college ranks," Montegna said.
