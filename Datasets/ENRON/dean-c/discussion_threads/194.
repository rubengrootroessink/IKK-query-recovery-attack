Subject: QSE project manager conference call on 12/13/2000


This is to invite you to the first QSE project
manager conference call. The QSE project manager
conference calls will be held on a bi-weekly basis
to provide a new forum for more timely discussion
of issues related to market readiness activities
for QSEs. This e-mail is being sent to all QSE
project managers and attendees of the QSE project
manager kick-off meeting on November 15, 2000 in
Austin.

The following is a draft agenda. Please e-mail any
suggested agenda items and I will e-mail a revised
agenda to all of you next week.

1. Conference call format, frequency, and time
etc.
2. Follow up on action items from Nov. 15th
meeting
3. Registration / Qualification update
4. Testing update (Ancillary services, RTU, ICCP,
Private Network)
5. Formation of task force for API/XML
6. Mock Market update
7. Questions and answers

Details of the conference call:

Date: Wednesday 12/13/2000
Time: 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. central time
Call in number: 1-800-291-0540
Participant Code: 186878

If your organization will have multiple attendees
to the conference call, ERCOT would appreciate
your cooperation in limiting the number of lines
into the conference call by sharing one speaker
phone from each entity. This will help manage
simultaneous conversations as well as costs of the
conference call.

Please put your phone on mute for the duration of
the conference call except when you are speaking.
If you do not have a mute button on your phone,
you may press *6(star 6) on your phone for mute
mode and press *6 again to un-mute the line. If
you are close to a personal computer during the
conference call, you will have the option to send
questions via e-mail to ClientRelations@ercot.com
during the conference call if you are unable to
ask your question verbally due to the voice
traffic. Your questions will be printed and
addressed during the Q&A session of the conference
call or logged for follow up in the next meeting.

Housekeeping:

Dial the assigned phone number 3-5 minutes prior
to the scheduled conference start time

Listen carefully to the recorded operator
instructions.

Have the assigned Participant Code at hand for
easy entry at the prompt.

Please do not put your phone on hold during the
conference call. This may introduce your company's
call waiting music or announcement to the
conference call.

A roll call of the attendees will be done at the
beginning of the conference call and at the end of
the first hour only.

You may press *0 anytime for conference call
operator assistance.

We look forward to your participation.
