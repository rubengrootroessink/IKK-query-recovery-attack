Brown Gets Big Raise; Assistant FB Coaches Also  Will Benefit

Texas ootball coach Mack Brown has been given a $450,000 raise to boost his
annual salary to  $1,450,000 and maintain his status among the top 10
highest-paid college football coaches in the country, Longhorn Athletic
Director DeLoss Dodds announced Tuesday.
Brown's raise is an increase from the 10-year, $1 million per year contract
that he signed following the 1998 season.  He will have eight years
remaining
on the $1.45 million per year contract.
"Mack has done a terrific job for The University of Texas, our Athletics
Department and the football program," Dodds said.  "We are extremely proud
of
everything he, his staff and the student-athletes have accomplished and are
excited about our future."
"It is very important that the head football coach at Texas remains in the
upper echelon of coaching compensation, which is an ever-changing dynamic,"
Dodds said. "This raise is in response to the current demand in the
coaching
marketplace and a well-deserved reward for Mack's hard work and dedication.
We are thrilled with the direction he has taken our football program and
look
forward to a long-lasting relationship."
Brown has led the Horns to three straight nine-win seasons for the first
time
since 1981-83 and is guiding UT to a third-straight bowl game for just the
second time since 1985. The No. 12 Longhorns  will face the No. 8 Oregon
Ducks  at the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego on Dec. 29.
Brown's Texas program is one of only seven schools nationally that is
riding
a string of three straight nine-win campaigns.  Including a pair of 10-win
seasons at North Carolina prior to his arrival at Texas, Brown joins Bobby
Bowden (Florida State), Steve Spurrier (Florida) and Bill Snyder (Kansas
State) as the only NCAA Division I-A coaches who have led their teams to
five-straight nine-plus win seasons.
"I appreciate the continued commitment to our football program from The
University of Texas," Brown said.  "I'm proud to be the head coach of the
Longhorns."
Brown's assistant coaches also are in line for raises.
Football raises about $40 million of the entire $50 million budget for all
the men's and women's athletic programs. It is the only program that shows
a
profit. Baseball and men's and women's basketball are the only other major
revenue sports, and none of them produce as much revenue as they spend.

FOOTBALL NOTES: Longhorn ticket sales are lagging for the Holiday Bowl are
lagging and Oregon fans are snapping up some of the 11,500 tickets that
were
allotted to Texas fans. If Longhorn fans don't step up quickly, Oregon fans
are going to occupy the vast majority of the seats in San Diego on Dec. 29.
.
. The Longhorns begin practicing for the bowl game Thursday. All the
practices will be closed to the public. . . Former Longhorn and pro
football
great Harley Sewell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame
this
week. . . . Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis, who missed most of this
season
with a sore shin, will get a look at TE in spring practice. With the
emergence of freshman receivers Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas,
the 215-pound Ellis might have a better chance of seeing meaningful playing
time by beefing up a little and playing tight end. . . Another spring move
that is being contemplated is seeing if sophomore LG Derrick Dockery could
move over to LT to replace departing senior Leonard Davis. Texas has three
good guards in Dockery, Antwan Kirk-Hughes and Tillman Holloway. Mike
Williams is the only returning tackle who has seen a lot of action. In
addition to getting the best five linemen on the field at the same time,
that
move might give the offensive line more fire because Holloway is a very
aggressive lineman. The offensive line has frequently been cited as lacking
fire and leadership.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are having their annual football
banq
uet this weekend. Most of the players making official visits will be
players
who already are committed to Texas, but there are at least two exceptions.
OL
William Winston of Houston Madison and S Rufus Harris of La Porte are both
scheduled to visit. Super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco now says he is going
to
take all of his visits in January. Texas leads for Winston and Johnson and
it
it a UT-A&M battle for Harris.
