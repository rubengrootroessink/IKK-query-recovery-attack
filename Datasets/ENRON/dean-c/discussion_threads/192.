Jakes Becomes Horns' 20th Pledge, More Expected Soon

DL Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, of Valencia, California, became Texas' 20th
commitment Thursday morning. He said he called UT assistant coach Tim
Brewster early Thursday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.
Jakes is one of the top defensive line prospects in California. He played
nose guard most of last season, but played end for the final few games. He
had 60 solo tackles and 14 sacks. In the game I saw on tape, he was playing
nose guard and he had seven solo tackles and two sacks while being
consistently double-teamed.
He told me he doesn't care whether he plays defensive end or defensive
tackle. "I just want to play," he said. "I thought all along I probably
would
wind up at Texas and, after looking at everything, I think Texas is the
place
for me."
He said he had scholarship offers from Colorado, Miami, USC, UCLA, Oregon,
Oregon State "and just about everybody else in the Pac 10."
He narrowed it down to Texas and California, cancelling a scheduled trip to
Miami, then got an in-house visit from Washington coach Rick Neuheisel
Tuesday night  from Longhorn head coach Mack Brown  and Brewster Wednesday
morning before picking the Longhorns.
Jakes lived in Plano during his junior high years and said he really
enjoyed
his time in Texas.
"I think Texas is building something special," he said, "and I want to be a
part of it."
James fills an urgent need for Texas. The Longhorns need to sign some
defensive linemen and he and Tommy Harris, the big DT at Killeen Ellison,
are
the only top ones who have been seriously considering Texas. Harris, the
nation's top DT prospect, has been leaning toward OU recently, but he was a
heavy Texas lean earlier, so there is always a chance he will change again
until he signs with someone in February.

WR Montrell Jones, 6-2, 185, 4.4, a national top 100 prospect from
Louisville, Ky., Male, says he is seriously considering Texas after backing
off an earlier commitment to Kentuckiy.
The Longhorns don't need a wide receiver this year unless they can sign a
great one. Jones is a great one with good height, great speed and very good
moves to go along with great hands.
The only other out-of-state prospects who have expressed any interest in
Texas lately  are TE Marcus Spears of  Baton Rouge Southern Lab, DT
Marquise
Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and  RB Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky.,
Bryan
Station. The two Louisiana stars say they probably will visit Texas and
Shelton says he might visit the Longhorns.

FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorns are 6-point favorites over Oregon for their
Dec. 29 Culligan Holiday Bowl clash in San Diego . . . Look for LB Aurmon
Satchell of Denver Jefferson, who signed with Texas last February, but ran
into some academic problems with the NCAA's National Clearinghouse, to
return
to Texas and enroll next  month for the spring semester. That would enable
him to go through spring practice and it also would keep him from counting
against the 25-man limit for the enrolling scholarship players next fall.
With 20 commitments already, that is very important. . . TE Brock Edwards
and
S Lee Jackson both appear to be recovered from the injuries that knocked
them
out of the last two games last year. They should be ready for the bowl game
unless they suffer a setback when practice resumes next week. . . When
Arizona hired former UT coach John Mackovic, the first thing that came to
my
mind was how Mackovic basically threw in the towel after the 66-3 UCLA loss
in his final 4-7 season coming on the heels of a 10-2 year that had given
the
Horns a top 10 pre-season ranking. Fast forward to this season. Mack
Brown's
Longhorns were a pre-season top 10 team, but OU mauled them, 63-14. Brown
said he was embarrassed to be the Longhorn coach and he really went to work
to bring the team back from that debacle. What he got was six straight
wins,
a bowl game and a team that can crack the top 10 in the final poll for the
first time in 17 years if it wins its bowl game. That's why he's worth the
big bucks and the other quy wasn't.
