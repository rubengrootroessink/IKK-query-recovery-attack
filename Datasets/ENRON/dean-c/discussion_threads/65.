Longhorns Get Pledge from Killeen Ellison Linebacker

Yamil LaBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, a middle linebacker from Killeen Ellison,
announced his commitment to Texas Monday, giving the Longhorns nine early
commitments. The Horns had pulled a big surprise earlier Monday, getting
Mike
Garcia, a big offensive lineman from Galena Park, to switch from A&M to
Texas.
LaBron and  Garcia were the seventh and  eighth high school players to
commit
to Texas this month. In addition, Alfio Randall, a star OT at Blinn JC,
says
he will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn.
The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan
Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman
Reeves
of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
"I went to the Texas camp two weeks ago and they offered me a scholarship,"
LaBron said Monday night. "I verbally committed to them when I met with the
coaches with my dad. I'm waiting for my mom to come home from Puerto Rico
so
she can talk to them, too. To tell you the truth, I'm going there anyway.
I'm
going to be a Longhorn."

I talked to Chris Hill, Roy Williams' mother, tonight and she said the
shoulder injury Roy suffered on the opening kickoff of the Texas-California
All-Star game Saturday night, involves stretched ligaments and she said the
doctors say it will heal on it own. California won the game, 29-27, on a
53-yard FG on the final play.
"He's in a lot of pain," she said. "It's very sore. We took him to a
specialist and the examination showed stretched ligaments in the shoulder.
The specialist said it should heal on its own in a few weeks."
She also said the doctor said he should be fully recovered by the time the
freshmen report at Texas in mid-August.
Williams, a great wide receiver prospect from Odessa Permian,is one of the
top Longhorn recruits. He is 6-3, weighs 208 pounds and he ran a 10.03 100
meters last track season. He also high jumped 7-0 and he set a state record
in the broad jump at the state meet with a  25-6 leap.
Sloan Thomas of Klein, another of the outstanding WR recruits Texas signed
in
February, caught five passes in the second half and was one of the key
players who led the Texas team's comeback from a 26-7 deficit. He caught
one
touchdown pass and set up two others with outstanding catches in heavy
traffic. On the two great catches in traffic, he was behind the secondary,
but had to come back because the balls were underthrown. He ran a 10.38 100
meters his junior year and, like Williams, has a great combination of size
and speed. He is 6-2 and weighs almost 200 pounds.
DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Mark's, another UT signee, split time at
end
and tackle and was outstanding at both. He had two sacks and consistently
put
pressure on the California quarterbacks.
C Jason Glynn and DT Sonny Davis, the other two UT signees who played in
the
game, also looked good when they got to play. Glynn opened some good holes
on
the late scoring drive that put Texas ahead, 27-26, with just 17 seconds
left. Davis appeared to be carrying a little excess weight, but he was able
to push the Cal blockers back into the backfield at times.
This was the second straight year California has won the game in the final
seconds.
B. J. Johnson, the nation's No. 1 WR recruit and another Texas signee,
sprained an ankle a week before the game and was not able to play. He said
the ankle sprain is mild and won't hamper his ability to be in good shape
for
the start of workouts at UT in less than seven weeks.

RECRUITING NOTES: DT Tommie Harris, LeBron's teammate at Killeen Ellison,
says Texas and Florida State are his top two teams right now, followed by
A&M,
Miami and UCLA. Harris  probably is the nation's top DT recruit, and he is
a
good friend of Greg Barnum, the center who quit the Tennessee team several
weeks ago and is considering transferring to Texas to continue his football
career.
