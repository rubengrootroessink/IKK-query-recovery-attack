UT Gets Heralded Point Guard; Horn FB Team Battling Bruises

T. J. Ford, the 5-11, 165-pound point guard who was recruited by schools
all
over the country, picked Texas Wednesday, saying he wants to play
basketball
for coach Rick Barnes and the Longhorns.
Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to a 36-1 season and the state Class 5A
Championship last year,  probably is the most heralded basketball recruit
in
Longhorn history. He is rated as one of the nation's top 25 players and is
one of the top two or three point guards.
He had offers from schools all over the nation, but wound up deciding
between
Texas, Louisville, Memphis State and Houston.
I saw Ford at the State Basketball Tournament last year. He is as quick as
any player I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than anyone I
have seen at the high school level. He can dunk the ball easily, too. He
averaged 9.1 points, 9.3 assists, 5-1, rebounds and 4.8 steals for
Willowridge last season.
He is great at everything except shooting, and that won't bother Barnes,
who
likes point guards who are more interested in distributing the ball than in
their shooting opportunities. Distributing the ball is what Ford does as
well
as any point guard in the country.
He had a press conference Wednesday  to announce his decision to play
basketball for the Longhorns.
"I'm excited to have a chance to play for coach Barnes and the Longhorns,"
he
said. "I just felt like Texas was the best place for me. I have a great
relationship with coach Barnes and the other Texas coaches and I'm looking
forward to it."
But first, Ford said he hopes he can help Willowridge win another state
title. "We have four guys back who started last year," he said. The team
lost
6-8 center Ivan McFarlin, who signed with Oklahoma State, but Ford said the
Eagles have another good inside player to replace him.
The Longhorns have only two scholarships to award this year and Chris
Wright,
a  6-10 center at Redwater, committed last year.  So, unless some
underclassman leaves the team, Ford's commitment wraps up recruiting. Both
Ford and Wright plan to sign on Nov. 8, the first day of the early signing
period.

The Longhorns finally got in a full-scale practice Wednesday after being
driven indoors by lightning Tuesday..
Coach Mack Brown said he and the other coaches have stressed to the team
this
week the importance of playing good games back to back.
"We've proved we can play well after a loss," he said. "We need to prove we
can play well after a win. We've been a team that never knows who's going
to
show up, and we need to start showing up every week."
Brown said he told the players they can beat everybody left on the schedule
or lose to everybody left on the schedule, depending on how hard they work
and how hard they play.
He said injuries are a problem, particularly at defensive tackle. "Casey
Hampton is the only one who is healthy," he said. "Shaun Rogers will play,
but his ankle is still sore. Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder and Stevie
Lee
is still out with his foot injury."
He said he still hopes to redshirt Adam Doiron, but said, "We might have to
play him this week. We're really thin at defensive tackle. Doiron is a true
freshman from Duncan, Okla.

The Longhorns are a 21-point favorite over Missouri.

QB Chris Simms said Tuesday he might redshirt next season, but said he has
no
plans to transfer after losing the starting job to Major Applewhite. Simms
played last year as a true freshman and he could have two years left after
Applewhite graduates if he redshirts next season. If  he redshirts, current
freshman QB Chance Mock would back up Applewhite.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: With 19 early commitments, the Longhorns
probably
will sign six to eight more prospects. They can take at least 26 players
because punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC will enroll in January
and
can be counted against last year's class total. . . TE James Moses and DE
Jonathan Jackson, the two Galena Park North Shore stars the Horns are
recruiting, say they plan to come to the Missouri game this weekend.
