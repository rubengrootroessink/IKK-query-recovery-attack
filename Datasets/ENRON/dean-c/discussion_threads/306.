My friend at CPSB (Johnny Forbes) and I were talking last night and he told 
me that RHLP had been running test on their Ranger system which is the system 
that will run CPSB generation and interface with the ISO.  Johnny says that 
for the last three weeks, each time that RHLP had tried to run the Ranger 
system the Joint ACE and the units would not respond.  Their are many bugs in 
the system!

Johnny said the CPSB Ranger system is still in a box on the floor in the 
Control Room.  Their is talk at CPSB that it will be at least three months 
before the ISO begins to work as planned.

Johnny also told me that the Texas State Senate had passed some sort of Bill 
that would allow Ercot to postpone the Deregulation process.  According to 
Johnny,  ERCOT is just waiting for someone  ( ENRON, RHLP, AEP-CNTRL etc. ) 
to say they are not ready before they exercise this option.  

I hope this information is of some value and not just some gossip!
