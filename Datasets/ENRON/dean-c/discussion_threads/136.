Scouting Missouri

Texas hosts Missouri Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in a game that will not be
televised.
The Tigers have been an unpredictable team this year, playing Nebraska and
Michigan State tough, and getting blown out by Kansas last week.
Missouri opened the season with a 50-20 win over Western Illinois, lost to
Clemson, 62-9, then played Michigan State down to the wire before losing,
13-10. The Tigers played Nebraska tough the next week before losing, 42-24,
then whipped Oklahoma State, 24-10, and lost to Kansas, 38-17.
Longhorn coach Mack Brown said he watched part of the Nebraska-Missouri gam=
e
"and I thought they had a chance to beat Nebraska in Lincoln while I was
watching it."
TB Zain Gilmore, a 6-1, 222-pound junior is the Tigers' top rusher. He is
averaging 55.3 yards per game rushing and has scored six touchdowns.
Freshman QB Darius Outlaw, 6-4, 193, is filling in for injured starter Kirk
Farmer and has completed 38 of 76 passes for 489 yards and three touchdowns=
.
But he also has been picked off seven times.
Defensively, the Tigers are led by All-Big 12 DE Justin Smith, a 6-5,
265-pound terror.
Coach Larry Smith has five offensive and six defensive starters back from a
4-7 team a year ago.
This is a game the Longhorns will be favored to win by at least 15 points,
and it is one they should win handily if they come out ready to play.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                               Missouri
Offense

Big 12 Roundup

Oklahoma showed it is ready to challenge for the top spot in the Big 12 las=
t
week by going to Manhattan and handing No. 2 Kansas State a 41-31 whipping.
The Sooners are firmly in the driver's seat in the Big 12 Southern Division=
,
while top-ranked Nebraska and Kansas State will meet later this season to
determine the Northern Division champion.
Conventional wisdom holds that two league losses eliminate a team from
championship competition.
If that is the case, then half the teams in each division have already been
eliminated, leaving Oklahoma, Texas and Texas A&M as the teams in the
Southern Division with legitimate title hopes and top-ranked Nebraska, Kans=
as
State and Iowa State as the teams witha chance to win the Northern Division
championship.
At least one of the contenders will fall by the wayside this week when Texa=
s
A&M travels to Ames to take on surprising Iowa State.
Other interesting games this week include Colorado at Kansas, Texas Tech at
Kansas State and Missouri at Texas.

Recruiting Roundup

There have been a lot of people who have been saying the disaster in Dallas
will damage UT recruiting.
But the week between the disaster and the victory over Colorado was one of
the best of this recruiting season for the Longhorns.
The Texas coaches got commitments last week from a great JC punter, the
state's best QB and one of the top DE/LB prospects in the country.
The latest Longhorn pledge is DE/LB Eric Hall  of Clarksville, Tenn. He
actually plays quarterback and safety at Clarksville, but Texas, Nebraska,
Tennessee and Texas A&M were all recruiting him primarily as a defensive en=
d.
He said he picked Texas because he was born in Texas and has always had a
fondness for the state and for its state university. "I really enjoyed my
official visit to Texas," he said. "I just decided it was the place for me.=
"
Hall was the 19th commitment for the Longhorns. who also had picked up
pledges last week from QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and punter
Brian Bradford of  Trinity Valley JC.
Nordgren is easily the top pro-type passer in Texas and Bradford has been
rated as the nation's top JC punter by at least one recruiting service.
Nordgren  chose Texas over LSU, Tennessee and Colorado. He also was recruit=
ed
by most of the top programs, but had narrowed his choices to those four
schools. He told me had had 21 scholarship offers.
"It was really a close call between Texas and LSU," he said, "but I decided=
 I
wanted to play for the Longhorns."
Nordgren is a 4.0 student who also is a 6-6 high-jumper and 39.5 intermedia=
te
hurdler in track. He also starts for the basketball team.
=01&It came down to a great list of schools," Nordgren said, "but I felt at=
 home
at the UT campus. It=01,s a football program that I know I can help lead to=
 a
national championship."
Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says Bradford, "will punt in the NFL
someday. He's the best one I've ever been around."
Langston, who played and later coached at Oklahoma, said, "He's better than
any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there. He averages better than
43 yards and he gets tremendous hang time, in the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 (second)
range, which is really outstanding. He really gets great height and great
distance."
Langston said Bradford "is our team's MVP. He's one of the those guys who
turns the field over. He really changes field position."
Bradford told me he has "always wanted to play for the Longhorns." He was a
full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas
in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns.
Bradford can be counted against last year's class because he will enroll at
mid-year.
What I really like about Bradford is his emphasis on hang time. "I
concentrate on kicking it high," he said. "I'd rather have a 40-yarder with
no return than a 55-yarder that might be returned."
It obviously works out because he is averaging 43+ yards per kick, and stil=
l
getting close to five seconds hang time.
Here's a list of the Horns' 19 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Quarterback (1)
Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, 4.6, Dallas B. Lynch
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Defensive End (1)
Eric Hall, 6-2, 240, 4.5, Clarksville, Tenn.
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
Punter (1)
Brian Bradford, 6-1, 205, Trinity Valley JC
* * * *
The Longhorns, with 19 commitments already, will give at least three more
and, if things fall right at the end, as many as six additional ones.
There are five players =01) LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, S Dewayne Brandon o=
f
Temple, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE
James Moses, both of Galena Park North Shore =01) who strongly favor Texas.
But all of them are highly recruited national prospects and I would be mild=
ly
surprised if the Horns signed all five of them.
Then there are four great players the Horns are still recruiting very hard =
=01)
DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney H=
S
in Sarasota, Fla., and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami
Hightower of Jacksonville.
Texas has a pretty good shot at Harris, but the other three are not leaning
UT's way at this time.
Harris had a great junior year. I saw him play and he was awesome. But he h=
as
a sprained ankle that has hampered his performance this year.
When the ankle was well last summer, he ran a 4.78 40 weighing close to 270
pounds. He's still a super prospect and one the Horns need desperately.

UT Basketball Women Start Practice

The Texas women's basketball team  had its first practice Saturday, and
coach Jody Conradt said she is so pleased with her recruiting class that
three or four of the newcomers will challenge for starting jobs.
The Longhorns are coming off last year's 21-13 season, a second-place finis=
