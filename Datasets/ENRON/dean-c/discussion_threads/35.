No shame on me, I did try to e-mail you!  Glad things are going good for
you.  Smart move with the girlfriend, you both need your own space.
I'm busy as ever!  Can't remember if I told you, I'm the CAD Manager now.  I
like it okay, it's just hard to juggle those full-time responsibilities and
go to school three nights a week too.  Only 2 weeks left though and I'm
finished until fall.  I wish I was finished for good, but that will take a
few years.

It was good to hear from you!
Keep in touch!
when are coming to town?

Take care!
Melissa

Melissa,

I have changed jobs.  I now work for Enron.  My new email address is
clint.dean@enron.com.  I left my old job on March 31, so if you've tried to
get a hold of me, that's why I haven't responded.  If you haven't tried to
get a hold of me, then shame on you.  Anyway, things seem to be going good.
My girlfriend is graduating in May and moving to Houston to start her new
job at Conoco.  No, we will not be living together.  We figured we ought to
ease into things, since we haven't lived in the same city for awhile.
Besides, she needs to be out on her own for a little while.  Remember that
car I had when you last saw me at Amy's wedding, well I was able to pay it
off the other day.  I'm feeling pretty cool now.  That's about it from
here.

Clint
