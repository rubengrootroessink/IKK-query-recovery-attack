Nordgren, State's Top QB, Picks Texas over LSU

Dallas Bishop Lynch QB Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 222, 4.6, is the Longhorns' 18th
commitment, and he said he came aboard this week to show his support for
the
UT coaches and to express his confidence in their ability.
Nordgren, the state's top quarterback prospect and one of the top 10
passers
in the country, chose Texas over LSU, Tennessee and Colorado. He also was
recruited by most of the top programs, but had narrowed his choices to
those
four schools. He told me had had 21 scholarship offers.
"It was really a close call between Texas and LSU," he said, "but I decided
I
wanted to play for the Longhorns."
He called me late Wednesday night to give me the news, but asked me to hold
it until around noon today.
He and Bishop Lynch coach Gary Oliver are going to announce Nordgren's
decision to sign with Texas at a pep rally at Bishop Lynch at 7 p.m. today.
Bishop Lynch is 6-0 and plays defending state TAPPs champion Houston Stake
Jesuit, also 6-0, this Friday.
"I just wnated to get it out of the way before our game and I wanted to let
the Texas coaches know," he said.
Oliver, who is a former wide receiver at Texas A&M, said Nordgren checked
out
a lot of schools before making his decision. "He is an outstanding
quarterback and an outstanding young man," Oliver said.
Nordgren is a 4.0 student who also is a 6-6 high-jumper and 39.5
intermediate
hurdler in track. He also starts for the basketball team.
"It came down to a great list of schools," Nordgren said, "but I felt at
home
at the UT campus. It's a football program that I know I can help lead to a
national championship."

Redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson will start at  safety Saturday, and Lee
Jackson will back up Pearson and fellow safety Greg Brown.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher
will
be his nickel back Saturday.
DT Shaun Rogers practiced Wednesday and coach Mack Brown and Reese said
they
hope his sore ankle will allow him to play 15 to 20 plays Saturday.
Redshirt
freshman Marcus Tubbs will continue to start at right DT.
Brown also said sophomore LB O. J. McClintock under arthroscopic surger on
his right knee Tuesday and "he'll be out two to four weeks. It went well,
and
they think he'll have a quick rehab."
Brown also said true freshman Adam Doiron, who has not played this year,
probably  will play at DT at Colorado. Doiron, a high school DE, has been
working at DT, recently, and Brown said he is making good progress.
"With Shaun Rogers and Stevie Lee both out, we're a little thin at
defensive
tackle," Brown said. "We'll probably take the redshirt year away and play
Doiron Saturday.
He also said another true freshman who hasn't seen action, LB Austin
Sendlein, might have to play Saturday if any more linebackers are injured.
Brown said the team realizes it has a lot of work to do to get ready for
Colorado.
