Applewhite Has Knee Sprain, Won't Play at Kansas & He's Iffy for Aggies

Coach Mack Brown said Monday the MRI on QB Major Applewhite's knee showed a
strained PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) in his right knee that will
sideline him for the Kansas game and possibly for the Texas A&M game, too.
"It's a sprained ligament," Brown said. "It won't require surgery, but he
is
out for this week and he's questionable for A&M."
Brown said he is slightly optimistic because "I've had five kinee
operations
and I never was moving around  as good as Major was Saturday night after
the
game."
But he said sophomore Chris Simms is the starting QB and will be backed up
by
Beau Trahan, with WR Courtnee Garcia, a former high school QB, also getting
some snaps at QB just in case any additional injuries occur at the
position.
Brown said he has no plans to play freshman Chance Mock, who is
redshirting,
because he said Mock runs the opposing teams' offenses for the scout team
against the Longhorn defense and hasn't worked with the first or second
team
offenses all year.
"We think he is going to be a very good player, but we still plan to
redshirt
him this year," Brown said.
I talked to a couple of friends who are outstanding knee surgeons and both
said Applewhite will have a hard time returning in time for the A&M game.
They said he would have a very difficult time backing up with a sprained
PCL.
Brown said it will be important for the offense to be two-dimensional
against
Kansas  so all the pressure for moving the offense does not fall on Simms.
Freshman DT Stevie Lee (broken bone in foot) won't be able to play Saturday
at Kansas, Brown said, adding that it looks like Lee, who was injured in
the
third game, will not be able to play again this year and will be eligible
for
a medical redshirt that will give him four more years of eligibility. If a
player is injured prior to the fourth game, he is eligible for a medical
redshirt if he is unable to return later in the season.
Brown said backup CB Ervis Hill has a separated shoulder and is out for the
rest of the season. He also said backup WR Artie Ellis is still having
problems with a sore shin and won't play Saturday.
Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery last week and
Brown said the doctors said it went well.

The Longhorns are starting true freshmen at their three primary recever
positions, and Brown said all three of them are playing well. WRs Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson have been starting for several weeks and they
already rank first (Williams) and second (Johnson) on the list of Longhorn
freshmen receivers in yardage for a season. TE Brock Edwards moved up when
Mike Jones hurt his knee, and Brown said Edwards, who got his second start
Saturday at Texas Tech, "played really, really well. His blocking is much
better and he made two outstanding catches." Williams has 544 yards in
receptions this season and Johnson has 496. The previous freshman high was
set by Lovell Pinkney, who had 458 receiving yards as a freshman in 1992.

Brown said the Longhorns have been playing much better during their
four-game
winning streak, and he cited three primary reasons. "The Oklahoma game got
our attention, we simplified our offense and Major got well," he said. He
said Applewhite had started looking like his old self in recent weeks.
"Seven
months out of a knee operation is not a long time," he said, citing the
time
between the surgery on Applewhite's left knee and the start of two-a-days.

RECRUITING NOTES: Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison plans to come
to
the A&M game the day after Thanksgiving. . . I'm not sure how soon it will
happen, but I will be very surprised if super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco or
super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple wind up anywhere else but in Austin.
