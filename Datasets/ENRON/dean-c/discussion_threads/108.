Hey!? How's it going?? Guess who I ran  into last night at a casino party???? 
yep, good ol' Jenn Hughes, actually  Jenn Bryarly now!? She looks exactly the 
same . . . tall, lanky & still  very silly!? She asked about you almost 
immediately.? I said you were  doing great with a Jenn of your own and that 
you were down in Houston.? She  works at the Richards Group, an advertising 
agency here in Dallas, and lives off  75 & Coit Rd.? I met her husband, Matt, 
who's a CPA and pretty  cute.? (Let it be known that I think you're cuter!)? 
But, she seems to  be doing very well.? It was so great to see her and catch 
up on all the  gossip about our friends!? She still keeps up with some girls 
you probably  knew - Kelli Carr, Cindy Medina, Connie Golden & Tara Khaler 
(remember  her?)? Anyways, I thought I would let you know?what's going on 
with  your ex. That all seems like so long ago, huh?? Well, I hope you're 
doing  well with your new & improved Jenn and I'll talk with ya soon.? Love,  
Amy
