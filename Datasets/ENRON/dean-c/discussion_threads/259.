I don't miss Reliant at all.  I love it over here.  Lots to do and.. I am
learning all sorts of stuff - hopefully will be able to transfer into
something different eventually.

Have fun at the Kentucky Derby - is this a company sponsored thing?

Okay, just as long as you'll be there looking hot.  Its nice to finally
hear from you since you've been over there.  Do you miss Reliant?  Is El
Paso treating you well?  I'm doing well, but drinks will have to wait.  I'm
working very hard right now.  I'm going to the Kentucky Derby this weekend.
It should be fun.  John Kim is going as well.
