Brown Says Injuries Piling Up, UT-Tech on Fox TV at 6 p.m.

The Longhorns are a 41-point favorite over Baylor in their 11:30 a.m.
Saturday game in Austin. It will be televised by Fox Syndication.
Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns' injuries are piling up at certain
positions and he said some players will be cross-trained to improve the
depth
at those positions.
Sophomore TE Bo Scaife, the projected starter, suffered a season-ending
knee
injury during pre-season practice, and junior TE Mike Jones took a lick on
the knee against Missouri that will keep him out of action indefinitely.
That leaves true freshman Brock Edwards and walk-on Cullen Loeffler as the
only able-bodied tight ends on the team. Brown said Edwards will start
Saturday, and he said FB Chad Stephens, a former TE, will be cross-trained
so
he can fill in at both positions. TB Ivan Williams also will be
cross-trained
at fullback, he said.
He also said OT Robbie Doane has been moved to guard because Antwan
Kirk-Hughes' shoulder injury is limiting his playing time. He said the
Longhorns had to play starting OTs Leonard Davis and Mike Williams late in
the Missouri game "because they were the only healthy tackles we had." He
also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway "played his best game
Saturday. He played 53 snaps and did a good job."
Brown said DT's Shaun Rogers (ankle) and Marcus Tubbs (shoulder) also are
ailing, and he said he hopes both of them can play Saturday. He said
freshman
Adam Doiron might have to give up his redshirt year unless both of them are
able to play.
On the plus side, Brown said QB Major Applewhite is getting better each
week.
"He came into this year with a hurt knee and he didn't have a lot of
confidence in the knee," Brown said, "but he looked like the old Major
(against Missouri) for the first time" since he was injured in the Cotton
Bowl game against Arkansas.
Brown also said freshman WR Sloan Thomas, who caught two touchdown passes
Saturday in his first extended action, "is going to be a really good
player.
He's been making plays like that in practice, so we decided to play him
more." Brown said redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis is out with a sore shin
and he doesn't know when he will return. Ellis also was hampered during his
redshirt year with a stress fracture in his shin, and it isn't good news
that
the same shin is sore again.
Asked how he can get his team ready to play a Baylor team that has been
shut
out in its last three games, Brown said, "We need to worry more about us
than
our opponents. We just need to be a better football team. We have to get
ourselves ready, and this is a team that hasn't always done that."
The Longhorns can beat Baylor even if they aren't fired up, but the road
gets
much tougher the following two weeks with road trips to Texas Tech and
Kansas. Fox TV has picked the Texas-Texas Tech game for its 6 p.m. national
telecast on Nov. 4.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison said
he
came to the Missouri game Saturday, but got there late and didn't get to
visit with the other recruits. Harris said he had a good time and said
Texas
remains one of his top choices. . . Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota,
Fla., says he will announce his college choice Tuesday afternoon at 1:30
p.m.
He has been considering FSU, Texas and Boston College, but he took a visit
to
FSU last weekend and said he had a great time, so the Seminoles think they
have him.

BASKETBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Two walk-ons, including a former scholarship
player at North Texas State, have been added to the UT basketball team,
coach
Rick Barnes announced Monday. They are  6-6 junior guard/forward Deginald
Erskin and 6-1 freshman point guard Drew Gressett. Erskin, a cousin of
former
Longhorn Kris Clack, is from Gonzales. He played at North Texas State for
two
years, averaging 12.3 points as a freshman and 18.9 points as a sophomore.
He
will have to sit out this year, but can practice with the team. Gressett
was
an All-District guard at Austin Westlake last season, averaging 15 points
and
6 assists per game.
