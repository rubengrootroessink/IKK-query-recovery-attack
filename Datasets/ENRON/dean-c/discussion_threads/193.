If I send you on a trip to Circuit City, do you think you can find it? ?I
saw a couple of good stereos that I thought would go well for Dad in the
garage. ?They looked pretty nice and were less than $200. ?I figured we
could go in together and get him something like that. ? I thought that
would be better than a shirt or something. ?I'm going to go look at them
again tomorrow and I can give you some more specifics.
