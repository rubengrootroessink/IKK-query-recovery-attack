Folks,

Please note, as per the email below, there will need to be different 
reporting requirements if we purchase from an industrial that does not have 
FERC market based rate authority.  I have added this as an item on our 
checklist.

Thanks,
Tom.

Tom--  Bad Christi, Bad Christi -- I now have you on my distribution.

 This order is only applicable when EPMI purchases power from an industrial 
that does not have a market based rates tariff (license) on file at FERC.  In 
that case. the purchases need to be flagged separately for EPMI's FERC report.

Subject: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.
