Hey Baby,

Sorry that I haven't been able to email you yet.  It's been a busy day
already.  My presentation went well this morning (at least my part
did).  I'm meeting with Jen Garcia to work on our project again today.
I should be home before 7 unless Jen and I have some good things going.
When I get home, I have a exam to study for.

About grad. dinner- I called the other Mezzaluna and they're booked
also.  Bren called her mom for suggestions and she named about 8
different restaurants.  So, hopefully some of them will have room!  I'll
tell you which ones they are when I get home.  PLEASE remind me about
the invitations!  I've got to send them out soon.  I'm sending mine to
your parents, Bren's parents, Tom & Jeanette, and the Denneys.  Anybody
else?

I'm really hungry so I'm going to eat my pb&j sandwich soon!  (Yeah,
food!)  I'm so weak (or is it tired?) that I can't see very well.

Seeing you soon is what keeps me going!

Love you,
Jenn
