Brown Says Offense Much Improved, Defense Very Solid

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns' offense should be much better
this season, and he said the defense should be his best since coming to
Texas.
Brown said the players showed up in great shape and have shown a lot of
enthusiasm in all of the early practices. He also said thd depth,
offensively
and defensively, will be better than it has been.
The offensive line is the main question mark, and Brown said flatly, "The
offensive line is much improved. There is a lot more cohesiveness. Most of
the guys were starting for the first time last year and they are much more
sure of what they need to do now that they have more experience."
He said guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes is the most improved offensive linemen,
but
he also said, "We feel like all five (offensive line starters) will be
quality
players."
The team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense, but the
coaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard. That is a sure sign
that they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive
tackle. They want to have four tackles and four guards. With Leonard Davis
and Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up
and Kirk-Hughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman
Holloway backing them up, they get their desired two-deep. Broad also said
junior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle. At center,
starter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker.
Brown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year. "If we
think
they can help us win, they'll play," he said following a two-hour practice
session Sunday Morning. True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman
WR Artie Ellis, both in the 6-3, 6-4 range, had outstanding practices.
Looking at the 21 freshmen, it appears likely that 14 will play. They are
Garr, WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, TE
Brock Edwards, DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan
Vasher, LB Austin Sendlein, safety Phillip Geiggar, punter Justin Smith and
kicker Matt McFadden.  Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers, at
least in back-up roles, so they will have a little experience when they
take
over the two jobs next year.
TE Bo Scaife's season-ending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on
the fast track to get him ready to play quickly. TE coach Tim Brewster says
Edwards is picking up things very quickly. Brown said, "The thing  that Bo
gave us was great speed down the field. Brock Edwards looks pretty fast,
too,
and he's ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bo's knee." Scaife came
to Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee.
The true freshmen who probably won't play, barring a rash of injuries at
their positions, are QB Chance Mock, RB Sneezy Beltran, FB Will Matthews,
OLs
Trey Bates and Jason Glynn,  and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas.
Mock,
as the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite, will be
trained to be ready to play, but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him. He
has
been looking very good. Beltran and Matthews also look good, but the Horns
are deep at their positions. Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some
offensive linemen, and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates.

Correction: Oh boy, when I mess up, I mess up. In last night's fax, I
quoted
a Texas coach as comparing Roy Williams favorably with Lovell Pinkney and
Mike Williams. Obviously, I meant Lovell Pinkney and Mike Adams. Sorry
about
that. Got my Mike's mixed up.

RECRUITING NOTES: Texas continues to lead for the state's best DT, Tommie
Harris of Killeen Ellison; best LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; best safety,
Dewayne Brandon of Temple; best RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee; best QB
Matt
Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, and best TE, James Moses of Galena Park
North Shore, , , The high school football season starts next week, and, for
the first time in several years, I will be able to scout five of the
state's
top players without driving very far. They are Harris, Johnson, Brandon, CB
Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes (a UT commitment) and QB/Athlete Quan
Cosby of Mart.

My next fax will be Monday, August 21.
