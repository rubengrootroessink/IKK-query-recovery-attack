For all who are interested, I have placed the ERCOT protocols of Jan 5, 2001 
that the PUCT have approved on the M drive.

The path is M:/electric/ERCOT/1_5_01protocols


Mock market update:  We were successful in sending balanced schedules 
yesterday.  Thanks to Jeff for lending a hand on building the mock position 
manager.

Today Fronterra is scheduled to respond to test signals from ERCOT starting 
at 1pm.
