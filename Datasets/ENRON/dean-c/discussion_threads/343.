Over the past ninety-three years Delta Sigma Phi at the University of Texas 
has continued to evolve and change.  We all have experiences and memories 
within the fraternity that will last a lifetime.  Today Delta Sigma Phi is at 
a crucial point in establishing itself as an organizational leader on 
campuses both nationwide and at the University of Texas.

The key to the success of Delta Sigma Phi is recruiting high quality men.  
Steps have already been taken by the Alumni Control Board and the 
undergraduate chapter to recruit a better man.  Recently, the ACB has raised 
semester scholarships for the highest GPA for an active and pledge to $250.  
Also with the mortgage on the house paid for, the ACB now also provides free 
semester rent in the house for double occupancy to any member that made a 3.5 
GPA or better the previous semester.   This next fall we will have a full 
house with four inhouse brothers qualifying for free rent.

During our time as undergraduates we lived the Eta Experience.  Our 
friendships and memories were fueled by the statement "You join Delta Sigma 
Phi for life."  All of us can reflect, as I have in my chapter advisor report 
in the soon to be released newsletter, about the importance that the 
fraternity has had on our lives.  However, the extending network of 
brotherhood should not end when we graduate from school.  In an effort to 
recruit the highest quality men it is necessary to provide an established 
alumni base that is willing to work with members not only while they are in 
school but also once they become alumni themselves.

I along with many of you have in the past become disenchanted with the 
undergraduates for one reason or another.  I certainly do not approve of the 
undergraduate actions of old.  However, today a good quality group of men 
exist.  Grades are at the highest they've been since I've become involved 
almost 3 years ago.  Long gone are the days of active members enrolled at 
ACC, St Eds, or not even enrolled at all.  Times are definitely changing.

Part of that change includes the current undergraduate chapter and the ACB 
proactively contacting Eta alumni to grow this network.  With the summer upon 
us, the undergraduate members are asking for alumni to help in the recruiting 
process.  A few of us in Austin, Houston, and Dallas have volunteered to take 
undergraduates and rushees to small events: lunch, dinner, sporting events, 
etc.  I invite all alumni to help the undergraduate chapter this summer as 
well as in the future.  Please contact me by e-mail (MeliaTim@aol.com) or by 
phone (512 707-0813), and I will put you and the undergraduates in your area 
in touch.
