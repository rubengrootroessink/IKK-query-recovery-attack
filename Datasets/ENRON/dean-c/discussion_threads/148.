Mitchell, Stockton, Defense Lead Longhorns
Past Raiders; Applewhite Hurts Other Knee

It was a game of surges, weather wise and on the football field, Saturday
night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed, 29-17, because the Longhorns had two
surges and Texas Tech had only one.
The Longhorns dominated the first quarter  an d most of the second in cold,
rainy, sold-out Jones Stadium, coming out smoking offensively for the first
time all season.
Midway through the second quarter, Texas was ahead, 16-0, and seemingly on
the way to an easy win. But Texas Tech scored 10 points before intermission=
,
then scored again early in the second half to take a 17-16 lead.
Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury (the right one, not the
surgically repaired left one), the Longhorns roared back to score the game'=
s
final 13 points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big 12 title cha=
se.
Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhite's knee Sunday and he
hopes to know the results sometime Monday. He said he is hoping it is just =
a
sprain.
The Longhorn heroes were plentiful. Offensively, the entire line played
great, TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five fiel=
d
goals and narrowly missed on a 55-yard attempt late in the first half.
Mitchell had 45 carries for 229 yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns. =
He
also caught six passes for 38 yards.
Defensively, the Horns forced five turnovers, which the offense converted
into 20 points, and shut the Raider offense out for the final 25 minutes.
The victory gave Texas a 7-2 season record and 5-1 Big 12 mark, while Tech
fell to 6-4 overall and  2-4 in the Big 12.
If Texas A&M upsets Oklahoma this weekend, the Longhorns can tie the Sooner=
s
for the Big 12 South title by beating Kansas and A&M to close the regular
season.
By virtue of their win over the Horns, the Sooners would represent the Sout=
h
in the title game, but the tie and a 9-2 record would land the Longhorns in=
 a
top bowl game.
The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and to=
ok
a 10-0 lead. They got the ball first and drove 69 yards to the Tech 5, with
Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking
and a 1-yard pass reception. But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a
23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 11:08 left. Tech went three plays an=
d
out, and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went 62 yards for a
touchdown and a 10-0 lead with 6:18 left. He carried four times for 35 yard=
s,
including a 5-yard burst over right tackle for the TD. Applewhite also hit
freshman TE Brock Edwards for 18 yards during the drive. With the aid of tw=
o
penalties against UT, the Raiders drove to the Texas' 11, and QB Kliff
Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the 5, but Baker fumbled and the Horns
recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended.
SECOND QUARTER
The  drive that started at the Texas 5 stalled at the TT 30, but Stockton's
47-yard field goal gave UT a 13-0 leadwith 12:54 left. UT safety Greg Brown=
's
interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Tech's next effort, but Texas
couldn't move and punted for the first time. Kingsbury, operating out of th=
e
shotgun, bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball a=
t
the Raiders' 16. The Horns picked up a first down at the 4, but Mitchell wa=
s
stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete, so Stockton kicked a
22-yard field goal for a 16-0 lead with 9:06 left. But the Raiders came rig=
ht
back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a 39-yard touchdown strike tha=
t
cut the UT lead to 16-7 with 7:34 remaining. Texas had to punt   and Tech,
aided by a pass interference penalty, drove to the UT 11 before settling fo=
r
a 28-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 16-10 with 5:34 left. Applewhite
was sacked and fumbled on UT's next possession, giving the Raiders great
field position at the Texas 33. But the Longhorn defense held and a 49-yard
field goal try fell short. UT drove to the Tech 38, but Stockton's 55-yard
field goal try  just missed to the left in the final 30 seconds of the half=
.
THIRD QUARTER
Tech got the ball to start the half, but couldn't mount a drive. But
Applewhite's  pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman, who ran it back t=
o
the UT 14. Kingsbury got 13 yards on a QB draw, which was the longest Raide=
r
run of the game, and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard. T=
he
extra point put Tech on top, 17-16, with 10:35 left. But that lead was shor=
t
lived. Starting from their 25, the Longhorns drove to the Tech 18 before
Applewhite was sacked on a third-down play. He came up limping and never
returned to the game. Stockton booted a 36-yard field goal to put Texas bac=
k
on top, 19-17, with 6:07 left. The Raiders went three plays and out and so
did the Longhorns, but Stockton's punt was fumbled at the Tech 18 and Micha=
el
Ungar recovered for the Horns. Behind great blocking, Mitchell ran for 8,
then for the final 10 and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at
26-17, with 2:07 left. The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended.
FOURTH QUARTER
DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB
Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsbury's pass two plays later and ran it bac=
k
23 yards to the Tech 45. Mitchell carried fiv e times fror 25 yards and
Simms, under a big rush, found Johnson for 9 yards. But a penalty set the
Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal, a 32-yarder, =
to
put the Horns on top, 29-17, with 9:54 left. The Raiders killed most of the
clock with a long drive that came up empty. They drove from their own 20 to
the UT 33 so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from 9:54 to 4:01 by
the time their fourth-down pass sailed incomplete. The drive would have end=
ed
much earlier, but for two strange penalties against the Horns. One was a la=
te
offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul =
on
UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury. The officials said the foul w=
as
a blow to the head, but Redding didn't appear to hit him in the head. At an=
y
rate, after the fourth-down play failed, Mitchell carried six straight time=
s
for 28 yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhite's knee injury Saturday nig=
ht
does not appear to be as serious as the one he suffered in the Cotton Bowl
game against Arkansas.
The injury to Applewhite's left knee in the Cotton Bowl required surgery to
repair a torn ACL (anterier cruciate ligament.
Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a
sprain. "I'm not a doctor, so I don't know," he said. "We're having an MRI
done today, and we'll know more tomorrow."
But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton
Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas
Tech game.
"We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game," Brown said. "He
walked off the field with me. He was upbeat and excited about the game. It
sure didn't look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game."
He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms
played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhite's
injury turns out to be serious.
"Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field," Brown said. "He pu=
t
a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season. I felt like
last night was the most comfortable he has been."
"There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than h=
e
was at the first of the season," Brown said.
Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them. As he said, "my
main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right."
With Hodges Mitchell rushing for 229 yards and 45 carries (both career high=
s)
and the line opening huge holes, that was the Longhorn offense for most of
the night.
Brown also said he probably wouldn't take the redshirt off freshman QB Chan=
ce
Mock if Applewhite's injury is serious. "We'll talk about that. I'd think
right now we'd play Beau Trahan."
Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards "played really well," and he said DT
Casey Hampton, DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton, LB De'Andre Lewis and D=
Bs
Quentin Jammer, Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well, too. He said LB Tyro=
ne
Jones "had by far his best game."
He also said the offensive line "played great and Hodges did a great job of
picking his holes. We've shown the ability in the last four games to throw =
it
or run it. We couldn't do that earlier in the year."
Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense, a=
nd
he said, "I'm really proud of the offense to, with four minutes left, take =
it
and drive it on the ground and run out the clock. I've alway said you need =
to
be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win."

Owens, Thomas Lead Horns

Junior 6-9 forward Chris Owens had 27 points and 14 rebounds and 6-8 freshm=
an
forward James Thomas had 25 points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn
basketball team to a 92-81 exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Austral=
ia
before 2,305 fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night.
"I think, for the most part, we played hard tonight," Texas coach Rick Barn=
es
said.  "I think our guys realize that with being such a young team, you hav=
e
to go through some growing pains.  Our defense was not good tonight.  We go=
t
hurt in transition defense and by dribble penetration, so we'll obviously
have to work on those things."
Owens scored his 27 points on 11-of-22 shooting in just 28 minutes of work,
while Thomas went 10-of-16 from the floor. Junior swingman Maurice Evans
added 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting, while junior point guard Fredie Willia=
ms
had five points, seven assists andseven steals.
Texas concludes its exhibition season with a home game against EA Sports
California All-Stars Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Erwin Center.
The Longhorns open the 2000-01 regular season when they host Navy on Monday=
,
Nov 13 in the opening round of the Preseason NIT at 7 p.m. at the Erwin
Center.

Dillard, Freshmen Sparkle

Sophomore guard Tai Dillard led six Longhorn players in double figures with=
 a
team-high 16 points, plus seven assists and eight steals to pace the Texas
women's basketball team to a 91-56 victory over Spartak-Moscow in exhibitio=
n
game action at the Center Thursday night.
Texas never trailed in the contest, jumping out to a 12-0 lead in the first
2:56 of the game.  UT was aided  by seven Spartak-Moscow turnovers in that
span.
Spartak-Moscow, which opened a two-week exhibition swing through the states
of Texas and Louisiana against the Longhorns, committed 36 turnovers, 19 of
which came in the first half. Texas had 22 steals in the game, while
Spartak-Moscow had 13.
Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were sophomore guard Alisha Sare,
who had 13 points and hit three 3-pointers, and freshman forward Annissa
Hastings and junior forward Tracy Cook, who each added 12 points. Senior
guard JoRuth Woods finished with 11 points, while freshman forward Stacy
Stephens scored 10 points..
"We'll need to spend some time looking at the videotape of this game, becau=
se
everything that could happen in a basketball game happened here tonight,"
said Texas head coach Jody Conradt. "I think we started strong, pushing the
ball up the floor which was good, but then the game was too easy at the
start, and we got into a lull."

Injury Update

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday reserve CB Ervis Hill suffered a separated
shoulder and will miss the Kansas game, but he said OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes
played most of the Texas Tech game without having any shoulder problems.
Kirk-Hughes' shoulder had been popping out, but Brown said he was encourage=
d
that he went through an entire game without problems.
He also said DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle.
Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery Wednesday and =
is
out for the remainder of the season.
Brown said Haywood had a high school shoulder injury that flared up again
this year.
He said the surgery should eliminate the problem, and he said Haywood might
be available for part or possibly all of spring practice.
