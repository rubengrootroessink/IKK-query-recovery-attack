At last week's RUG meeting, I was asked to prepare
a brief description of what is in ESCA's current
design for deployment of Balancing Energy Service.
I hope the attached document is what you were
expecting.  I have also included some design notes
I found on the issue of ERCOT operator's name and
receiving operator's names in the dispatch
instruction.  Let me know if additional detail is
needed.
