Longhorns Will Wrap Up Spring Football Drills Wednesday

The Longhorns worked out in shorts Monday, and coach Mack Brown said the
tea=
m=20
will practice Tuesday at? 4 p.m. and then scrimmage Wednesday, probably at
5=
=20
p.m., to wrap up what he termed "our best spring? since we've been here."
Brown said the Tuesday practice will be at the Denius Fields and the=20
Wednesday scrimmage will be at Royal Memorial Stadium. He said he would=20
announce a time for the scrimmage at Tuesday's practice.
NCAA rules require that three of the 15 spring practices be in shorts,
and=20
Brown said that was the reason the team practiced in shorts Monday. "We=20
practiced in shorts the first two days, and we had to get a third day in=20
shorts," he said.
The Horns worked primarily on their passing game because it's hard to do
muc=
h=20
on the running game in shorts. QB Chris Simms continued to look very
sharp,=20
and sophomore TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards both made several
outstanding=20
catches. Everyone knows about the Longhorns' fine WRs, but there won't be
a=20
better pair of TEs in the Big 12 than Scaife and Edwards. There might not
be=
=20
a better pair in the country.
Brown said the Longhorns will have more speed on defense this season
than=20
they have had since he got here. "Everything we're doing is trying to get
th=
e=20
fastest guys on the field," he said, noting that former LB O. J.
McClintock=20
is doing a good job of pass rushing at DE, and former DE Maurice Gordon
is=20
doing the same at DT.=20
"In each case, those moves were made to increase our speed," he said.

If you saved the class chart in my March 12 newsletter, take a look at
the=20
players in each class and see how many top hands you see. I did that
today=20
and I counted nine fine players in the sophomore class, plus three others
wh=
o=20
might be fine players, too. No other class has more than five, although
the=20
12 redshirted freshmen might produce more than that.
I'm not going to identify the guys who I think are really good in each
class=
=20
because then it would be obvious which starters I don't think are really=20
good. I try to avoid being overly critical of any of the kids,? so I
would=20
suggest you look at the class chart, too, and see how you think the
various=20
classes rank.
One other important thing to note is that senior CB Quentin Jammer is an=20
outstanding player who is projected to be the first defensive back picked
in=
=20
the next NFL draft. But he has a very hard time covering either of the=20
Longhorns' pair of star sophomore wide receivers (Roy Williams and B. J.=20
Johnson) on a consistent basis.
Opposing teams usually double cover Williams, which means Johnson and
the=20
tight ends draw single coverage. That is going to make the Longhorns'
passin=
g=20
game more potent than ever this season.
Scaife is regaining the form he showed last spring before injuring his
knee=20
during the pre-season workouts. If he hadn't missed last season, I think
the=
=20
Longhorns would have gone 11-1. Obviously, he wouldn't have made that
much=20
difference in the 63-14 loss to Oklahoma, but I think he would have made
a=20
big difference in the narrow losses to Stanford and Oregon. The
Longhorns=20
were building their passing offense around him before his injury, and he=20
would have helped buy time for the true freshmen wide receivers to begin=20
helping out.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are leading for a great wide receiver=20
prospect from Champaign, Illinois. He is Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 190, 4.4.
UT=20
assistant Tim Brewster, an Illinois graduate, is handling the
recruiting.=20
Johnson says he already has an offer from Illinois, but he says Texas
leads=20
Illinois, FSU, Michigan and Notre Dame. He said he might come to a UT
camp=20
this summer. Johnson is a national top 100 prospect heading into his
senior=20
season.

Texas basketball assistant coach Rob Lanier has decided not to pursue
the=20
head coaching job at St. Bonaventure, his alma mater. He said he sees
"great=
=20
potential that exists for our basketball program here at Texas," and
feels=20
"confident that is it in my best interest to continue assisting coach
(Rick)=
=20
Barnes in maing our program here at Texas one of the best in the country."
