Frank attached are the forms to file with ERCOT to name Enron as our QSE.  We 
need for them to complete some of the contact information on both forms.  
Once that has been done, they can sign the acknowledgment form and send the 
completed documents back to us for our signature and filing.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.  Of course, Enron can contact me if they have any 
questions as well.
