Practice Cut Short by Lightning; Haywood Undergoes Surgery
The Longhorns cut their practice short by about an hour Wednesday because
of
a thunderstorm with intermittent lightning that swept through Austin during
the late afternoon.
But coach Mack Brown said the team had a good workout, and he said the
coaches are working with the offense to try to iron out the wrinkles that
have caused the team to struggle in the first quarter this season.
He said the offense has been improving steadily since QB Major Applewhite
took back the starting job and the freshmen wide receivers began starting,
and he said the coaches have been telling the players a slow start could
prove fatal to the team's chances of winning Saturday night at Texas Tech.

Longhorn athletic officials inquired about the possibility of moving the
time
of the Kansas game next week in Lawrence to make it available for pay per
view, but the move failed and it will be played as scheduled at 1 p.m. with
no TV.
Three Big 12 Conference games will be on TV on that date ? Oklahoma at
Texas
A&M (noon, ABC), Iowa State at Colorado (2:30, Big 12 network) and Nebraska
at Kansas State (6 p.m., FOX).
Can you believe TV nixed our game with Colorado to show A&M at Baylor and
is
now nixing out game at Kansas to show Iowa State at Colorado? There must be
more TV sets in Iowa and Colorado than I realized.

INJURY UPDATE: Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery
Wednesday and is out for the remainder of the season. Brown said Haywood
had
a high school shoulder injury that flared up again this year. He said the
surgery should eliminate the problem, and he said Haywood might be
available
for part or possibly all of spring practice. Brown also said true freshman
DT
Stevie Lee, who underwent surgery several weeks ago to repair a broken bone
in his foot, still can't run, and he said Lee might not be able to play
again
this year. If he doesn't play again, he will be eligible for a medical
redshirt year, which would leave him with four remaining years of
eligibility. Brown also said S Lee Jackson (quad) and WR Artie Ellis (shin)
will miss the Texas Tech game. He said LB O. J. McClintock, who underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery about a month ago, was able to work out Tuesday
and
Wednesday and probably will be able to play some at Lubbock. He said DT
Shaun
Rogers (ankle) and OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes (shoulder) probably will be able
to
play some at Tech, but he said neither is close to being 100%.

RECRUITING NOTES: OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter created quite a stir
earlier this week when he was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he
remains
committed to Texas, but might take a visit or two just to be sure of his
commitment. Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both
parties. He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will
guarantee them scholarships, and they are supposed to guarantee they will
honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools. Scott has
talked off an on about visiting other schools, but he hasn't set up any
visits yet. I'll keep you posted if he does. . . Central Texas normally
doesn't have very many top recruits, but four of best in the state and in
the
nation his year are in Central Texas and three of them play in District
13-5A, which stretches from Waco in the north to Georgetown in the south.
They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson  of Waco
and
DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple. The other top prospect is QB-Athlete Quan
Cosby
of Mart, who led his team to a 15-0 record and a Class 2A state title last
year. Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson,
Brandon and Cosby. Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference, but
he has been more noncommital about his college choice recently. I think,
Texas has a great chance to get all four of them and that would really put
t
he icing on an already outstanding recruiting class. Student Sports
magazine
currently has UT ranked No. 2 behind Michigan in the national recruiting
rankings.
