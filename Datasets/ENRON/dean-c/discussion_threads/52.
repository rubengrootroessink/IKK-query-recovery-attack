Happy Anniversary to me!? Can you believe it's  been 2 years since I've seen 
you!
How's your job going?? Are you planning to  visit Dallas any time this 
summer?? We'd love to have you & Jen come up  and see our house (plus?I'd 
like to check out your chic & make sure  she's worthy of the Master!) Hope 
all is well with you.? 
Talk to ya later -- Amy

P.S.? Remember my friend Gina?? She got  married last Saturday.? It happens 
to the best of us!
