3. OL Jami Hightower, Jacksonville

7. RB David Underwood, Madisonville (Michigan)
8. C Ben Wilkerson, Hemphill
9. QB Matt Nordgren, Dallas Bishop Lynch
10. OL Abe Robinson, Jersey Village (Texas)
11. LB Jonathon Jackson, Galena Park North Shore
12. DE Kevin Everett, Port Arthur Jefferson
13. WR Armon Dorrough, Lancaster
14. Ath Joseph Addai, Houston Sharpstown

Out-of-State Prospects

Texas is recruiting several out-of-state players. Here are the ones who are
still considering UT:
Quarterback
Bret Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (LSU, UT, FSU, Tenn)
Running Back
Jabari Davis, 5-11, 224, 4.5, Tucker, Ga. (Tenn, Ga, UT, Neb, Ala)
Eric Shelton, 6-3, 230, 4.45, Lexington, Ky., Bryan Station (Ky, FSU, Fla,
Tenn, UT)
Fullback
James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Sarasota, Fla. Mooney (FSU, UT, Fla, BC)
Tight End
Marcus Spears, 6-5, 275, 4.8, Baton Rouge Southern Lab (LSU, A&M, Mich, UT)
Defensive End
Eric Hall, 6-3, 232, 4.5, Clarksville, Tenn., NW (UT, FSU, Tenn, Neb, LSU)
Shaun Cody, 6-5, 255, 4.8, Los Altos, Cal. (USC, UCLA, UT, Az, ND)
Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, Valencia, Cal. (UT, Az, USC, Neb, UCLA, Wash, =
ND)
Defensive Tackle
Marquise Hill, 6-7, 290, 4.8, N. Orleans De La Salle (FSU, LSU, Mich, A&M, =
UT)
* * * *
On the out-of-staters, UT has a 50-50 shot at Hall, and Rawls, Jakes and
Buchanan also are very seriously considering the Longhorns. Cody says he
definitely will visit UT, so the Horns have a fair chance with him. The odd=
s
are much longer on Davis, Shelton, Spears and Hill.

Scouting Louisiana-Lafayette

If the Longhorns don't break their 10-quarter scoring drought quickly in
their Sept. 9 season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette in Austin, it will =
be
a very bad sign.
The Ragin' Cajuns didn't do much ragin' last season, going 2-9 with their
only victories coming over 1-AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee.
They also gave up an average of 219 yards per game rushing and allowed
opposing backs to average 5.5 yards per rush.
The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts, but they didn't score a
touchdown until their fifth game last season.
Coach Mack Brown says you don't really know what you have until you start
playing other teams. He still won't know after this day in the park.
The game starts at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 9 and will be televised by the Fox
Network on a syndicated basis.

Baseball Adds 1, Loses 1

The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri, 5-11, 17=
5,
from Seward County JC in Kansas, but they lost one of their prized recruits
last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for $=
2
million.
Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season.

Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up

The season opener in football is always big news, and it's also going to be=
 a
big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some
big-time recruits taking official visits the Sept. 9 weekend.
It's really big for the men, who have only one scholarship remaining. T. J.
Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class
5A championship last season, will visit.
Ford is the player the UT coaches want, and there is a chance he will commi=
t
on his visit.
The Longhorn women have three scholarships left, and two outstanding player=
s
have scheduled visits for the Sept. 9 weekend.
One of them has a name you will remember. She is Lauren Selmon, a 6-0
guard-forward from Norman, Okla.
If that rings a bell, you are right. She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon, o=
ne
of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a
quarter of a century ago.
I was in Oklahoma, working as a political reporter for The Associated Press=
,
when the Selmons played at OU. Unlike some of the later Sooner stars, who
made the wrong kind of headlines off the field, the Selmons are fine people
The other is Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from Chestermere HS in Alberta, Canad=
a.
She averaged a triple double last season (14 points, 10 assists, 12 rebound=
s).
