Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State

The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday, Dec. 29,
Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego, and their opponent will be either
Oregon
or Oregon State. Both Oregon teams shared the Pac 10 title with Washington,

which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl.
Oregon State, 10-1, will be the Longhorns' opponent unless the Beavers get
a
berth in one of the BCS bowls, probably the Fiesta. If OSU gets a Fiesta
bid,
then Texas would play Oregon, 9-2.
The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at 7:30 p.m. Texas time.
Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at
1-800-982-BEVO or local fans can call 471-3333. If anyone wants to buy
tickets in person, the ticket office is located on the first floor in
Bellmont Hall.
Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are "excited about accepting this
invitation" and he said they are also excited about playing either of the
Oregon teams, because both are ranked in the top 10.
Brown also said the game should help Texas' recruiting efforts in
California
and throughout the Pac 10 area because of its location and he also said it
should help recruiting nationally because it is "a nationally televised
(ESPN) game that does not compete with any other game that evening."
Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec. 13, but he said some
of
the coaches will work with some of  the players next week. Most of the
coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out
again next week.
"Recruiting is our top priority right now," Brown said.

Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close
to
100% by Dec. 29, but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite

will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris
Simms, who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a 43-17 win over
arch-rival Texas A&M last Friday.
My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because (a) he had a great game
in
his last outing, and (b) he is completely healthy, while there will be some

questions about Applewhite's sore knee until he actually takes a lick on
it.
I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of
Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with
Simms handling the pinch-hitting role.

FOOTBALL NOTES: Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer
look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted. He said he
usually
watches them during the season, but said so many of the freshmen were
playing
regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting

them ready, which  prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he

would have liked. He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two
freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team
next year.
Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team, and
Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also
wants
to give Matthews a  shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: The private schools in Texas generally aren't
the
ones who produce top talent for the colleges, but two  freshmen, TE Brock
Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Marks,
started several games for Texas this year. There are some top seniors at
the
private schools again this year, headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas
Jesuit. There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing
from some of the top colleges next year. He is Jamie Beeghley, 6-2, 190,
4.55. He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit 14 of
19
passes for 195 yards and ran for 112 more yards in the championship game
victory over Fort Worth Christian. . . This year was the year of the
offensive linemen, which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to

sign five or six really good ones and they already have  been assured of
filling that need. Next year probably will be the year of the defensive
linemen, and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a
bunch of them. I've already seen four or five who would be top recruits
this
year if they were seniors. I mentioned several of them in my last
e-mail/fax
and I'll write more about them in my next newsletter.

My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant.
