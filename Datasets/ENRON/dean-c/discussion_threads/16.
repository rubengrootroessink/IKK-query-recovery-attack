Barnes Hires New Assistant; Summer Football Camps Start Next Week

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes announced Tuesday he has hired South=20
Carolina assistant coach Frank Haith to replace Rob Lanier as one of his
top=
=20
assistants.
The 35-year-old Haith, who joined coach Dave Odom's staff at South
Carolina=20
on April 16 after spending the past four seasons under Odom at Atlantic
Coas=
t=20
Conference member Wake Forest, will begin his post at Texas immediately.
=20
Haith assumes the post vacated by Lanier, who left the Texas coaching
staff=20
on April 18 to take the head coaching position at Siena College.
While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons
to=
=20
four consecutive postseason tournament appearances, including an NCAA
First=20
Round showing last season.  He also helped Wake Forest secure one of
the=20
nation's Top 10 recruiting classes during the 1999-2000 campaign.=20
"In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the=20
nation,"  Barnes said.  "He came very highly recommended from many of
the=20
high school coaches in the state of Texas and around the nation.  Frank
also=
=20
brings a great deal of familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this
area=
=20
of the country.  There is no question that it is just a matter of time
befor=
e=20
he becomes a head coach at this level."
Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the=20
associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97).  He spent one season
(1995-96)=20
as an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a
21-7=20
overall record.  During the year, Penn State was ranked as high as ninth
in=20
the national polls before placing second in the Big Ten Conference=20
regular-season standings and earning the school's first NCAA Tournament
bid=20
in 31 years.
"I am extremely excited about the opportunity to coach at The University
of=20
Texas," Haith said.  "There were two things that proved to be the key
factor=
s=20
in my decision to come to Austin.  One is the opportunity to work for
Rick=20
Barnes.  And second, having worked in College Station for four years, I
know=
=20
the potential that exists in Austin.  The Texas program is one that can
win=20
the National Championship."

ILB Aaron Harris of Mesquite, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, DE Travis=20
Leitko of The Woodlands and C Bob Morton of McKinney have at least two
thing=
s=20
in common. They are the state's best players at their respective
positions=20
and they have already achieved qualifying scores on the SAT.
Morton is committed to Texas A&M. Hardy favors Texas very strongly, and=20
Harris and Leitko are considering several schools, including UT.
This is a year when many of the top junior recruits have awesome test
scores=
.=20
OL Josiah Vinson of Irving has a 1,500 SAT score and Leitko and Morton are
i=
n=20
the 1,400 range.
Unfortunately, it's also a year when many of the super recruits will wind
up=
=20
having to go to the junior college ranks unless they sign with Oklahoma.
Two=
=20
top  Sooner recruits from Texas are full qualifiers now and they were
about=20
300 points away from qualifying when they signed back in February.
Coach Mack Brown and his assistants might seem to be starting a little
bit=20
slow in recruiting this year, but they actually are right on schedule.
June=20
is summer camp month at Texas and it's also when the Longhorn coaches
start=20
racking up pledges from top recruits. They have been doing it ever since
the=
y=20
got here, and they will do it again this year. Look for the Horns to get
at=20
least five or six top commitments next month.
The summer camps start one week from Saturday, so get ready for some
hot=20
recruiting news.
