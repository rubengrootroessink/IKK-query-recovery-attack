Hey!? I took your advice & attempted to  contact Karen.? I mailed a letter to 
her old address & had it forwarded  on.? She called me yesterday and we 
talked forever!
She had a boy, Nicholas Elijah Messick, on Leap Day  2/29 by C-section.? He 
weighed 9 lb. 10 oz. (I'm glad she had a  C-section!)? All is well with her.? 
She said that she & her  husband fight a lot but always work things out.? 
They live in a 15 yr. old  house in Rowlett near Hwy. 66.  So, everything 
seems to be very domestic in her  world!? She asked about you.? I said you 
were doing fine & still  in a serious relationship with a girl that's smarter 
than you! (ha!)?  Anyways, just thought I would pass on some friendly 
gossip.? Thank you for  nudging me in the right direction.? Talk to you later 
-- Amy
