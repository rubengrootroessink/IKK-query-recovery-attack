Horns Favored by 13; UT-Houston Game Set for 6 P.M. on Fox TV

The Longhorns are a 13-point favorite over Stanford for their 9:15 p.m.
(Texas time) game Saturday night in Palo Alto. The game will be televised
by
the Fox Network.
The Texas-Houston game in Austin Sept. 23 has been set for a 6 p.m. kickoff
and also will be televised by the Fox Network.
Coach Mack Brown said he is always happy when the Longhorns are on
television. "Our game last week was televised to 27 million people, and the
game Saturday at Stanford will be televised to areas with 48 million
people.
That's a lot of homes, from a recruiting standpoint," he said.

Brown said he was pleased with the season-opening 52-10 victory over
Louisiana-Lafayette Saturday, but he also said the Horns need to work to
improve. "If we don't play better at Stanford than we did Saturday, we'll
get
beat," he said.
"We have a lot of work to do this week," he said. "We still have got to
work
a lot on our running game. Our line was very physical in its pass blocking.
We didn't give up a sack and we had great pass protection. We've just got
to
be more physical in our run blocking and our backs have to fight for the
extra yards."
He also said he was concerned because Louisiana-Lafayette hit some long
passes, "and that's Stanford's game. Stanford will beat us to death if we
don't stop the long ball."
"Stanford is averaging 494 yards offensively in two ball games," he said.
"Their quarterback, Randy Fasani, is No. 1 in into offense in the Pac 10
and
his No. 6 nationally. They throw the ball down field. We will get tested
deep
in a hurry."
Brown said Stanford starts eight seniors on defense, and he said OLB Riall
Johnson, 6-3, 240, "led the Pac 10 in sacks last year with 13."  He also
said
DT Willie Howard, 6-4, 298, "is a pre-season All-Pac-10 selection. Both of
them are really good. They will be about as good as anybody we play."
He also noted that Stanford is a fast-starting team. "They've scored 51
points, and 45 of them were in the first half," he said. "We'd better be
ready to play from the opening kickoff."
Brown said the freshmen wide receivers deserve all the accolades they are
getting, but he also said some other young players had good games Saturday.
He said sophomore Cole Pittman and true freshman Kalen Thornton both
"played
very strong games" at defensive end. He also praised senior  RB Hodges
Mitchell and said he was outstanding in pass blocking for the UT
quarterbacks.
He continued promoting the idea that Texas has two first-team quarterbacks,
but there is little doubt that Major Applewhite's outstanding game in
relief
of Chris Simms will have him taking the first snap at Palo Alto.
Brown said there were no injuries in the Louisiana-Lafayette game.

RECRUITING NOTES: DE Eric Hall, 6-3, 232, 4-5, of Clarksville, Tenn., took
his official visit to Texas last weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He
said Texas is his favorite right now, but said he wants to take some other
visits before committing to anyone. . .DE Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of
Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., says he is trying to set up an official
visit
to Texas for the Sept. 23 weekend. Jakes is playing nose guard this year
and
he said he had two sacks and several other tackles for losses in Valencia's
opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale Highland. He said Highland is supposed
to
have a playoff-caliber team "and we really shut them down." Jakes lived in
Plano when he was in junior high and he said he is strongly considering
coming to UT. "I really like the way football is king in Texas," he said. .
.
OL William Winston of Houston Madison said he also plans to come to Austin
for the Houston game, but that will be an unofficial visit. He said he is
considering so many schools that he probably will use his five official
visits to look at out-of-state schools like UCLA, Tennessee, Miami,
Wisconsin
and LSU, and will take unofficial visits to Texas and Texas A&M.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: I won't have any more faxes this week because I am
heading
to California early to scout some of the players Texas is recruiting out
there and I won't be back until after the Stanford game.  My next fax
probably will be next Monday, Sept. 18.
