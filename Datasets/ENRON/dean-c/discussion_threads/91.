B. J. Johnson Has Big Day; Brown, Reese Like Backup Linebackers

B. J. Johnson joined Roy Williams as a freshman wide receiver sensation
Monday, making one truly sensational catch between veterans DBs Ervis Hill
and Joe Walker and making several other dazzling catches and moves.
Johnson and Williams were both ranked among the nation's top five wide
receiver recruits last year, and both have shown they certainly deserve all
the attention that came their way.
Johnson's great catch was on a long pass from QB Major Applewhite that he
managed to take away from the two defensive backs. He appears to be fully
recovered from a bad ankle sprain that hampered his summer workouts, and
he,
like Williams, looks ready to do some damage as early as the Sept. 9 opener
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
Freshman TE Brock Edwards also continues to improve on a daily basis and he
shows enough speed that the coaches hope he can fill the role they had
envisioned for sophomore Bo Scaife, who suffered a season-ending knee
injury
the first day of practice.

Coach Mack Brown said he really likes the way backup linebackers Reed Boyd
and O. J. McClintock are playing this fall, and he said he thinks they will
be able to give starters De'Andre Lewis and Everick Rawls a rest during the
season. "We'd like to get about 20 plays a game from them, and that would
let
D. D. and Everick  rest."
Brown said he intends to play backups a lot more this season than he has in
the past. "We have more depth at more positions this year," he said. "You
need to rest your starters at times, and we think we have enough quality
depth to do that."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said he likes the way Boyd and
McClintock are playing. He said they are particularly good as pass
defenders.
McClintock has had three interceptions during the first week of practice,
and
Boyd has knocked down several passes. He also praised the way Cole Pitttman
has played at DE since moving from DT. He said Pittman and Maurice Gordon
at
pushing starter Jermain Anderson.

One-on-one blocking drills between the fullbacks and linebackers Monday
showed clearly why Matt Trissel is the starting fullback and Brett Robin is
running No. 2. They are head and shoulders above the other fullbacks at
stopping a hard-charging linebacker. Freshman Will Matthews also excels at
times, but he lacks consistency. He looks like a budding fullback star,
however.

The Longhorns' practice schedule has changed slightly, so here is for the
remainder of the open practices (all practices are at Whitaker Field at
51st
and Guadalupe unless other noted):
Tuesday, Aug. 22, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. (the 5 p.m. practice will be the first
one in full pads)
Wednesday, Aug. 23, 9 a.m. and a 5 p.m. scrimmage at Royal Memorial Stadium
Thursday, Aug. 24, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Friday, Aug. 25, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Saturday, Aug. 26, 9 a.m. scrimmage at Royal Memorial Stadium, 5 p.m.
practice at Whitaker
Sunday, Aug. 27, Fan Appreciation Day at 2 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium
Monday, Aug. 28, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Tuesday, Aug. 29, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Wednesday, Aug. 30, scrimmage at 6 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium (first
day
of classes)

RECRUITING NOTES: College coaches can start calling players once per week
on
September 1, but they can't go to any games to scout players until October
1.
Look for one of their first stops in October to be at Shreveport Evangel,
where Bret Rawls, a transplanted wide receiver, gets his first start at
quarterback. Rawls was sensational at several summer camps, including the
one
at UT, but all the college coaches are going to want to see how he performs
in games. Rawls already is on several national 100 lists based on his
athletic ability and the way he performed in those summer camps. He likes
the
Longhorns.
