Out-of-State Prospects

These out-of-state prospects say they are considering Texas:
DT Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, Scottsdale Chaparral (UT, Mich, Cal, USC,
PSU)
DT Kasey Studdard, 6-3, 265, 4.8, Highlands Ranch, Colo (UT, Colo)

WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 195, 4.4, Champaign, Ill. (UT, Ill, Mich, ND)
RB Zan Johnson, 6-1, 215, 4.45, Winnfield, La. (UT, LSU, Tenn, Ala)
FB-LB Brandon Hancock, 6-2, 240, 4.55, Clovis, Cal., West (USC, UCLA, UT,

)

Recruiting Roundup

CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland ran a wind-aided 9.96 100 meters
Friday night. He is  one of the top junior recruits in the state. He favors
Texas over Oklahoma
WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3 1/2, 195, 4.4, of Centennial HS in Champaign, Ill.,
is one of the top receivers in the country and he is a Texas fan.
I watched him on tape last week and he  has size, speed, great hands and,
best of all, he is fearless when he comes across the middle. He caught 45
passes for 862 yards and 11 TDs last year.
He told me, "I've been a Texas fan since I was a little kid. I like the way
they run their offense."
He has an offer from Illinois, and is considering Michigan and Notre Dame,
but he plans to visit Texas unofficially this summer with his parents.
Don't be surprised if Texas signs several out-of-state players. Three
excellent players listed on the previous page =01) DE Chase Pittman and DTs=
 Lyle
Sendlein and Kasey Studdard =01) have strong Longhorn bloodlines and are
seriously considering UT.
RB Zan Johnson of Winnfield, La., one of the top players in that state, als=
o
has several relatives who are Longhorn grads, including former UT LB Lionel
Johnson. Johnson, Pittman and Sendlein all came to the UT spring game.
Two LB-FB combos =01) Brandon Hancock, 6-2, 240, 4.55, of Clovis, Cal., Wes=
t,
and Chris Herring, 6-2, 255, 4.5, Batesville, Miss., South Panola =01) also=
 are
considering the Longhorns, but are longer shots than the ones mentioned
previously.
Three players who have really zoomed up the recruiting charts since college
coaches started watching their tapes are LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar=
,
S Vickiel Vaughn of Plano East and OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood.
I've seen tape now and it's easy to understand why the college coaches like
them.
Smith is extremely quick and hard-hitting, Vaughn is a fast, hard-tackling
ball hawk and Valdez is a devastating blocker with really quick feet in
Brownwood's option attack.
Valdez came to the Texas spring game. Smith also is interested in the Horns=
,
but Vaughn is interested only in out-of-state schools right now.
I have listed other sports instead of schools by three players on my list o=
n
page 4.
At WR, Wardell Starling of Fort Bend Elkins will be a first-round  baseball
draft choice and will get a bonus offer that will almost certainly keep him
from playhing college football.
In the Athlete category, LeKeldrick Bridges of Dallas Hillcrest, and in the
Safeties, Bam Harmon of The Colony, both say they want to play college
basketball, not football.
All three are fine players. I left them on the list, just like I leave the
academic problems on the list, because I think we need to know who the best
prospects are at every position.

UT Drops 2 of 3 to Huskers

The Longhorns played the heck out of fifth-ranked and defending Big 12
baseball champion Nebraska last weekend, but they had trouble holding
late-inning leads until the final game.
Freshman lefthander Justin Simmons scattered eight hits and quelled a
Nebraska threat in the ninth inning to give Texas a 2-1 victory Sunday in t=
he
series finale in Lincoln.
Kalani Napolean made a perfect bunt to squeeze Ben King home from third in
the top of the ninth to break the 1-1 tie and give Texas the victory.
Simmons worked out of a two-out, two-on Husker threat in the bottom of the
ninth.
The game was scoreless until the sixth when Omar Quintanilla doubled and Ma=
tt
Rosenberg singled to give Texas a 1-0 lead. The Huskers tied it in the
seventh.
The Huskers had swept a doubleheader Saturday, 10-8 in 10 innings, and 5-4,
after Friday's opener was rained out.
Texas scored twice in the top of the ninth to take an 8-7 lead in Saturday'=
s
opener, but Nebraska tied it with a single run, then won it in the 10th on
Adam Stern's two-run homer.
Texas ace Albert Montez was in fine form through seven innings and had a 4-=
1
lead in the second game Saturday before Nebraska scored four runs in the
eighth for the winning rally.
The Longhorns fell to 13-5 in the Big 12, while Nebraska is 10-3. Texas is =
in
third place behind the Huskers and Baylor, at 12-3.
UT hosts Missouri in a three-game series this weekend.
