Subject: 

Today the Protocol Review Subcommittee passed unanimously a revision request 
that will allow ercot to grant "provisional authorization" to QSE to provide 
ancillary services for a period of 90 days while any deficiencies in the 
certification can be corrected.  The request will be sent to the TAC where it 
will have an e-mail vote and I would not anticipate any opposition. 

To receive the "provisional authorization" the QSE needs to have performed an 
Ancillary Services qualification test in good faith but failed to qualify due 
to problems that in the opinion of ERCOT, are noncritical for providing one 
or more ancillary services.  My understanding is that Frontera has not had 
the primary test.  According to John Adams at ERCOT four have been scheduled 
and subsequently cancelled.  It will be critical to schedule and complete the 
test to be considered for the "provisional authorization".  

I spoke with John Adams regarding staffing to help perform the qualification 
tests and he said that they would be able to do the certification tests at 
about any time without any major scheduling delays.  The only time when they 
would not be able to do the tests would be when ESCA will take control of the 
systems to perform cut-over operations.
