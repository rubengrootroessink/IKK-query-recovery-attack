Editor's Note: No one else has this commitment right now because the kid tol=
d=20
me I was the only reporter who has called him. I would appreciate if it you=20
would refrain from discussing it on internet bulletin boards for several=20
hours. I'm sure you all saw the Rivals Network has spent $75 million and=20
still gone belly up. I haven't spent $75 million and I'm still going strong,=
=20
but it is very frustrating to get a scoop on a commitment and then have some=

eager beaver slap it on an internet bulletin board five minutes after he get=

it from me like he is the one who spent hours tracking the kid down. =20

Brownwood Lineman Becomes First Longhorn Pledge for New Class

The Longhorns, after wrapping up a top five national recruiting class last=20
month, got started on another bumper crop Tuesday when outstanding Brownwood=
=20
junior OL Bret Valdez. 6-4, 310, 5.1, confirmed he has committed to the UT=20
coaches.
Valdez, one of the state's great run blockers, said he went to the UT spring=
=20
game March 31 and really liked what he saw. He said the Texas coaches offere=
d=20
him a scholarship ?at the spring game.
"They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year"=
=20
he said. "I competed in the Texas Relays (he throws the shot and discus) las=
t=20
weekend, and, after I was through competing, I went over to the coaches'=20
offices and talked to coach (Mack) Brown and coaches (Tim) Nunez and (Mike)=20
Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit."
He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including=20
Florida State, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama and Notre Dame. "The first time=20
they can come see us is in May and Florida State, A&M, OU, Notre Dame and=20
Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to come down and see m=
e=20
then."
But he said he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other=20
coaches who contact him that he is not interested.
"Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a=20
great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two," he=20
said. "I like the way they emphasize academics, too."
He plays tackle in Brownwood's option offense, but said he probably will be=20
tried at guard at Texas.
"I think I'll have a good chance to start after a redshirt year," he said.
The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next=20
February, and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other to=20
offensive line prospects I have been talking to, so they must consider Valde=
z=20
to be the state's top OL prospect.
Brownwood went 11-2 last year, and Valdez was the team's top run blocker. He=
=20
has thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162-7.
On tape, Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start that=
=20
allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward.=
=20
He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have=20
seen this year.
One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and won't turn 17=20
until June 15, but he already benches 320 and squats 600.

the Texas kids mentioned above are ranked first or second at the their=20

are highly recruited top national prospects.

SOFTBALL RECRUITING NOTE: Football and football recruiting are my main gigs,=
=20

mentioned in lots of national publications after striking out 33 and 31=20

mind boggling. She has given up 13 hits in 18 games involving 135 innings an=
