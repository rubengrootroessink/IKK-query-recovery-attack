All,
I appreciate all of the input I received in response to my email on the
Drop to POLR issue.  I have taken a few comments in mind in restructuring
the text.  I have not adjusted it much however, and there is a reason for
this.  The postcard which ERCOT mails out  has a limit of 600 characters
(spaces included) to use on either side of the card.  So when comments came
back I had to adjust the Drop to POLR language on a very limited basis,
especially when you take into effect how the Spanish translation will be
adjusted.  What I have below is my proposal of how the English and Spanish
translations should look on the postcard when mailed to the customer.  The
only language added to the post card is the text that is denoted between
the double asterisks below (**).  Right now the English stands at (503)
characters, while the Spanish side stands at (593).  I must offer a great
deal of thanks to those who were helpful working on the Spanish
translation, it was a very difficult standard to meet.  This proposed
language fully complies with ERCOT's requirement. I believe the language is
simple yet explanatory enough to provide either English or Spanish speaking
customer with enough information to make an informed judgement on this
issue.  This is the language I am proposing to RMS please keep all of the
restrictions I had to work with in mind when sending me back comments on
the added text below.

Thanks,
Kyle
