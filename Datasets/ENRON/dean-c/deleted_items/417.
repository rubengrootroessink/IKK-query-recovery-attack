CD,
 
Let me talk to the Germans and see what they say.  I'll see if they are willing to shell out any DM's for your services.  Did you think of taking a part-time job while you are there to subsidze yourself?  Most if not all the Germans will be working for there is not too much money there for salaries.
If you send me a copy of your resume I can send it to them and perhaps they could find something suitable.  Having an EU passport is a HUGE advantage.  Speaking German would be also......
 
Don't worry.  If you really want to do this we will find a spot for you.
 
Paco

Paco-
Hey I thought about our conversation last night and I think we
should cover the start and stop times to your season and some other
details that might be important.  This is my work e-mail...my home is
cdean12@earthlink.net.  I'll write you again from home.

Deano
