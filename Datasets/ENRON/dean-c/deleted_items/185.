I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is more important than UT football (just kidding).  Anyway, we will have to wait til next year, I guess.  I'm definitely looking forward to this weekend.  I'm not sure when I'm coming into town, but I might stop by before the game.  I'll let you know beforehand.  The weather for Sunday is supposed to be up around 80.

Clint, 
November 10th is Tori's birthday party.  No way I could make the game.  We'll have family in from out of town to entertain.  
Oh, how the weekends fill up.  I'm glad to hear that you'll be hanging out with us Saturday night and Sunday.  If the weather cooperates, we'll try to get the boat out.
See you Sat. night.  Tell your brother that I said Hello and that we need to go get a cheesesteak at Texadelphia.

Hey, I think I'm going to try and go to the game with my brother.  Sorry 
you won't be able to make it.  If it is cool, I would like to stay with 
y'all on Sat (its my birthday).  Also, you know I'm a big fan of taking the 
boat out.  The next, and last, home game is Nov. 10th.  I will go ahead and 
tell you now that you are welcome to go with me.  Let me know what you 
think.

Unfortunately, no.  We have friends coming in town-Scott and Mandy from 
Dallas.  We thought the 4 of us were going to be able to go to the game. 
However, Scott's hookup for tickets fell through.  Therefore, we will be 
watching it at my house.  It would probably be rude of me to go with you 
and leave them there.  You should come over after the game.  And, you are 
welcome to stay with us Saturday night.  We need to catch up.  We may go 
out on the boat Sunday if the weather is nice. 
Let me know.

     able to go.  Let me know.
