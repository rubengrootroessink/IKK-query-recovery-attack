The attached files (provided by Don Bender) contains key points from
three options for the conversion to 1.4 that was discussed at the
October 25th RMS meeting.  Please review these options with your
company.  We have an RMS workshop scheduled on October 31st and November
1st to come to consensus on the final conversion plan.  I will be
forwarding under separate email, the information that I have received
from Trish and Connie on the questions they have and information that
they would like to see.
