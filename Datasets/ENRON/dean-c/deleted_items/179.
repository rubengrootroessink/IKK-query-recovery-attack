At RMS' October 11, 2001 meeting, Nancy Hetrick, RMS Chair, announced that an effort was underway to create an integrated planning calendar for the 1.4 Migration Plan and mass customer move from TDSPs to the Affiliated Retailer.  On October 16, 2001, RMS sponsored a workshop on the 1.4 Migration Plan.  The selected strawman was Option B rev 01, which was review at the next workshop of the mass customer move held on October 17, 2001. That meeting's attendees asked clarifying questions, however did not add additional dates to the integrated planning calendar. 
Attached file is the presentation from 1.4 Migration Plan Workshop.  Attendees selected Option B Rev 01 as the strawman.  Please be prepared to discuss the selected strawman integrated migration plan at RMS' October 25th meeting.
