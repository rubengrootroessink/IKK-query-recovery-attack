Glen incorporated the wrong bulletin into the guideline.  Not his fault, though.  George's website obviously had a problem and they recovered back to an old backup without knowing that they were affecting the validity of the bulletins.  I requested that someone initiate a change control to repair the examples, but I don't know who is working on this. 
  
The initial bulleting was revised a couple of times to include new revelations from RMS workshops and actual experience. 
  
Regards,

Subject: Change Control conference call 10/24 
Shirley, these questions came up on the change control conference call this morning and Texas Set members could not understand the disparity between the bulletin and transaction set.  Can you help us?   
Question: 
6) Question 2 is also related to bulletin A0056 attached. 
In the examples provided in the document the Service Period Start Dates in 
the BO and PM Loops do not match the Service Period Start Date in the PP 
Loop.  The 810_02 Service Period Start and Service Period End states: 
"Monthly Invoice:  Required - The full service period should match the 
applicable PTD loops from the 867." 
A.  If the Service Period End Dates in the PP loop is different from the BO 
and PL Loops, what date should be used for the Service Period End Date on 
the 810_02? 
Question: 
7)  Question 3 is once again related to bulletin A0056. 
A.  Should the overlapping dates apply to the IA Loop as well, (i.e., since 
the IA Loop did not exist at the time the bulletin was created) or should 
they match the dates in the PP Loop?
