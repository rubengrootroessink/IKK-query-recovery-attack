tEXas tailgatES talk

Back on track. Texas is now 6-1, and ranked #7 in both polls.  I
said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business,
things would shake out for them. It's sort of setting up that way,
isn't it? 2 weeks ago, Texas was #11, with 10 unbeatens in front
of them. In the last 12 days, half of those teams have lost. Of
the 6 now in front, 4 play each other in the next 3 weeks, and
the other 2 have VERY tricky games (#6 Florida vs. #19 Georgia,
#4 UCLA vs. #11 Oregon). The 'horns are right there in it.

41-7

Hello, shovel pass. Texas won a big game. Okay, not THE big game,
but A big game nonetheless. The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping
their chests about their rushing game and physical defense, and
left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact. Texas forced 4
turnovers, tying a season high (OSU), shutting down the Buffalo
ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of 425
yards total offense. On to the shovel pass.

Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass, because they
only did it a few times in the Spring. If you did see them try it
in the Spring, your heart was in your throat (like mine) when they
ran it on their own 5, because it was never what you would call a
"good play" in practice. I think they tried it 4 times, and totaled
something like minus 9 yards and one interception. Nonetheless,
Simms sucked them in, Ced got the corner, and Roy sprung him to
mid-field. Two plays later (One being a fade to Roy that was maybe
Simms' best throw this year), touchdown. That was absolutely a
soul-stealing drive. If there is a team in college football better
at putting someone away right before the half than Texas, I haven't
seen them.

Missouri
1:00 pm
No T.V.

Well, the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for
you. The reason the pay-per-view didn't work is the way it was set
up. Texas residents would pay to see it, but it would be regionally
televised in Missouri. That sounds fair, right? Okay, now no one
gets to see it. Oh well, listen to the Texas game and watch OU play
Nebraska.

For those of you going to Missouri, it should be fun. Mizzou has
played pretty well in the last 3 weeks, but it's hard to get scared
of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME. Bowling Green? Are you
kidding me? Anyway, look (for those not going, listen) for Texas to
run, run, run this week. Missouri cannot stop the run (allowing 180
ypg), so Texas will exploit that. Last year Roy Williams ran loose
in the Tiger secondary, and Applewhite found him repeatedly
(7 catches, 87 yds). I see no reason for this to change, particularly
when Mizzou will have to put 8-9 on the line of scrimmage to stop
the run.

The tEXas tailgate will be at Spanky's Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn
in Columbia. The tailgate will begin at 9:30 am, and run until roughly
12:30 pm. The bar will be open, and snacks from the bar menu will be
available, but meals will not. There is a restaurant right next door
(in the hotel) that will be open for breakfast. Here's the hotel
information:

HOLIDAY INN SELECT COLUMBIA
2200 I70 DR SW
COLUMBIA MO 65203
573-445-8531
Please call if you need any more information or directions.

Week. The tailgate, hosted by the Waco Texas Exes, will be at George's
Party Zone, on Dutton Avenue, east of Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco.
Start time is still TBA, but I'd say between 9:00 - 10:00 am.

News and Notes:
* D.D. Lewis recovered his 10th career fumble in the 1st half. He
now is the career leader for recovered fumbles, passing Tim Campbell
and Oscar Giles. To boot, he started his 45th consecutivegame, tying
him for 2nd career consecutive starts with Lance Gunn and Anthony
Curl (both 89-92).
* Texas forced 4 turnovers for the 2nd straight week. The Longhorn
turnover ratio is plus 7 so far this year.
* The defense is ranked #7 nationally, and #1 in the conference,
averaging a shade under 200 yards allowed a game. Look for these
numbers to be even better next week.
* Texas kicker Dusty Mangum is tied for 10th nationally and is #2
in the Big XII in scoring with 63 points.
* Missouri receiver Justin Gage is #2 in the Big XII with 45 catches
and 518 yards with 3 touchdowns. He will get locked up with Jammer
this weekend.
* The Tigers have found their passing game in Big XII play. The last
3 weeks, qb Kirk Farmer has thrown for 637 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In the 1st 3 games, 3 Missouri quarterbacks combined to throw for
only 399 yards and 3 t.d.'s. Must have been that stout Bowling Green
defense. Don't mess BG, or you, too, will face the Falcon wrath.
* Kicker Brad Hammerich is 8-9 on field goals, missing only from 50+
yards, and 53-54 on P.A.T.'s for his career. Hammerich connected on
the game winner at Oklahoma State in the 3rd overtime 2 weeks ago.
* Linebackers Jamonte Robinson and Sean Doyle might be the best
linebacking duo in the country. Doyle leads the Big XII with 77
tackles, and Robinson averages 14 tackles per game (he is 6th on
the all-time tackles list at Mizzou). Sean, Jamonte, this is
Cedric Benson.

______________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Will somebody get K-State a doctor? More like a mortician. The
Texas A&M Aggies went up to the Little Apple and snuck out with a
win. The Wildcats were stopped on the 5 on 4th and goal, and the
Aggies left with a 31-24 road victory. Nice job, Ags. Bye, bye,
Wildcats.
* Tech went to Lincoln and played well. The Red Raiders lost by
10, but played Nebraska even through 3 ? quarters. OU looked lack
luster in a 33-17 win over Baylor in Norman. You think these 2 were
peeking around the corner at each other?
* Game of the day: Lincoln, NE. Sooners vs. Bug Eaters. This should
be a good show.
*2nd best game of the day: Iowa St. at Texas A&M. The Aggies will
take care of business here...or will they? The Cyclones are 5-1,
only losing to Nebraska. Running back Ennis Haywood had 196 yds
rushing and 3 t.d.'s in the 28-14 win over OSU. Careful, Ags, or
we'll see you whining about this game on "Sidelines" next week.


Everyone have a good weekend. Hope to see you at Spanky's in Columbia.
