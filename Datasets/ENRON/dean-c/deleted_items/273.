Gentlemen,
I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.  

Airproducts
Alcoa
BOC gases
Corrugated Services [Larry Jester]  	S, SA 
Crown [Larry Jester]  	Reliant 
Huntsman [Larry Jester]  	Odessa 
Kinder Morgan [Larry Jester]  W, Synder? 
Koch [Larry Jester]  	S, Corpus Christi 
Praxair
TotalFina [Larry Jester]    Baytown, Crosby, LaPorte, Seabrook  

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks, 
Clint
