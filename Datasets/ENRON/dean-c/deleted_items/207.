tEXas tailgatES talk

Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of
the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma
Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is
I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

45-17

Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise
on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas
adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running
game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got
his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day
with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing
lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary
to the tune of 5 touchdown passes. All in all, the much-anticipated OU
hangover did not come to pass. Texas took care of the weaker opponent,
as they should have.

Colorado
2:30 pm
ABC telecast

ESPN Gameday (the radio edition, not the t.v. show) will be here for
the game. Texas comes in ranked #8, and CU comes in ranked #14. This
is a game both teams need to validate their seasons. Texas needs to
show the world, and themselves, that they can indeed win a big game.
A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a
probable 10-win season (no offense, Aggies), while a loss could send
this team into a tailspin. Colorado, much like Texas, is a different
team at home. They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder, but now
must show they have grown up and can win on the road. This is a HUGE
game. If the 'horns hold serve, they should sail into College Station
9-1, with a BCS birth on the line. This will not be easy. Texas has
not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does. The Buffs are #2
in the Big XII/#13 in the nation in rushing offense (224.7 ypg).
National t.v. coverage, temperature in the high 70's, 2 top 15 teams
getting after it? I wouldn't want it any other way.

There will be no television for the Missouri game. The Texas Athletic
Department has asked the Missouri A.D. to allow a pay-per-view
broadcast for next week. The final decision has not been made
(as of Wednesday morning). If the game is on pay-per-view, it will be
at 2:30, if it is not, it will be at 1:00. For those of you going to
Columbia, the tailgate party will be at the Holiday Inn in Spanky's
Sports Bar. I will have a start time as soon as I know a game time.
It will be posted on the link below:

The Baylor tailgate will be at George's Party Zone on Dutton Avenue
(just east of Floyd Casey Stadium) and is hosted by the Waco Texas
Exes. Start time will be announced next week. Plans for the Texas
A&M game are still being discussed. Click the link below for more
information.

___________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Chris Simms tied a school record with 5 touchdown passes vs.
Oklahoma State (James Brown-'94- vs. Baylor). It's amazing what a
running game will do for you.
* Cedric Benson now ranks #10 on the all time single-game freshman
rushing record with his 131 yards. Charles Hunter holds the record
with 187 (Houston - '87).
* Benson was also named the starter for the CU game. His reign begins.
* Look for Texas to run the 3-4 and the 4-3 this week. The way the Buffs
run the ball, Texas will show them many different looks.
* Last week Texas A&M threw for 334 yards vs. CU. 334 yards from a
team that HATES to throw. Look for the 'horns to throw early to set
up the run.
* Injury update: Kalen Thornton (knee) is returning to practice this
week. The defensive end should be ready to this weekend. The news is
not as good for another de, O.J. McClintock (lacerated arm). Look for
him to redshirt this year, unless they absolutely must have him.
* Colorado starting cb Roderick Sneed is out for this game with a
pulled hamstring, and his backup, Phil Jackson, has a broken hand.
3rd team corner on Roy/B.J./Sloan/Tony/Kyle? Nice.
* Some Buffalo news you may not have heard: Jashon Sykes, the
All-America candidate at middle linebacker, is done for the year with
a herniated disc. His backup, Joey Johnson, was the Defensive Big XII
Player of the Week last week.

___________________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Nebraska beat Baylor, 48-7, but that's not the story, this is:
the Cornhuskers had 641 yards rushing in the game. They had 4 backs
go over 100 yards. 641 yards in one game. That's almost twice what
Baylor has for the season (374).
* Texas Tech whipped the Purple Wildcats from Kansas St, 38-19. Kliff
Kingsbury threw for 409 yards and 4 touchdowns for the Red Raiders,
the most passing yards ever allowed by K-State. The Wildcats are
circling the drain. They are 0-3 in conference and 2-3 overall.
They draw the Aggies this week, while Tech gets a head check at
Nebraska. Good luck, Raiders.
* Texas A&M seems to run into the same wall when they don't play well:
turnovers from sacks. Quarterback Mark Farris has fumbled 3 times
after being hit from the blindside, and all 3 have been returned for
touchdowns, the last one vs. Colorado.
* OU has named Jason White their starting quarterback, benching
ineffective Nate Hybl. A quarterback controversy, how interesting.


Have a good weekend. See you at the Alumni Center on Saturday!
