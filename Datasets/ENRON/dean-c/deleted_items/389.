Enron SUITE...Platinum LEVEL.  Big difference btw a suite and a level.  As
you have already deduced, the biggest difference is that a person or a
company owns a suite.  Therefore, drinks are free.

I took the tickets thinking you would like to go.  You can imagine my
grinning upon reading your email this morning.  Ahh, the irony of it all.

No, I meant what were you planning on doing with them before we started
discussing it?  Beers aren't free in the platinum level, what's up with
that?  When I went to an Astros game in the Enron suite, everything was
provided.

   What do you mean, what was I planning on doing with them.  I thought
   this
   would be a lot more fun that just going to a bar somewhere.  If you
   want, I
   can give them away, and we can go hang out at Chili's.

   Beers aren't exactly free out there.  But, you can also get mixed drinks
   while you watch the game.  Again,  suuuhhweeet.

   So what were you planning on doing with them?  By the way, I will buy
   all
   the free beers you can drink.

      Nope.  But I think they are $300 worth of tickets.  They are the
   CEO's.
      I
      just got them.  I've had them before.  That's how I know they are
      choice.
      The man knows how to watch sporting events.

      There's no way you actually went out and bought $300 worth of
   tickets,

            Well, as luck would have it, I have two tickets to the Stars
   game
      on
            Friday
            at 7:30.  I even have one parking pass (which we will have to
      figure
         out
            how
            to have this help you later).  They are platinum level which
   gets
      you
            into
            the Platinum Club.  Suuhhhwwweet.  It's pretty disgusting how
         decadent
            it
            all is.

            I figured you'd like this.  BTW, the building is AWESOME.  It's
      not
         for
            the
            purist because it is so decadent.  But, I am not a purist so I
      think
            it's
            really cool.

            Hey yo.  Still wanted to see if we could get together some time
         either
            next Friday or Saturday.  My preference would be to do
   something
            somewhat centrally located, so I wouldn't have to stay the
   night
      at
            y'alls place.  I even had the idea of going to a Stars or Mavs
      game.
         I
            wouldn't mind checking out the new building.  I looked at the
         schedule
            and the Stars play on Friday night, and the Mavs on Saturday
      night.
         Let
            me know what you think.
