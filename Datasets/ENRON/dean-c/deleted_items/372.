A group of girlfriends went on vacation and they see a five-story hotel with a sign that reads "For Women Only".  Since they were without their boyfriends, they decide to go in.  At the reception, a very attractive guy explains to them how it works.  "We have 5 floors... Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there.  It's easy to decide, since each floor has signs telling you what's inside.  But once you go past a floor, you cannot return." 

So they start going up, and on the first floor, the sign reads:  "All 
the men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive and kind.  The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. 

The sign on the second floor reads "All the men here are wonderful 
lovers, but they generally treat women badly."  This wasn't going to do, so the friends move up to the third floor where the sign reads, "All the men here are great lovers and sensitive to the needs of women."  This was good but there were still two more floors.  On to the fourth floor. 

The sign was PERFECT.  "All the men here have perfect builds; are 
sensitive and attentive to women; are perfect lovers; they are also 
single, rich, and straight."   The women seemed pleased but they decide that they would rather see what the fifth floor has to offer.. 

When they reach the fifth floor, the sign reads:  "There are no men here.  This floor was built only to prove that it is impossible to please a woman"!                Keith (FXdog1@aol.com)
