Hello craig.dean@enron.com:

Thank you for registering for a Microsoft
 .NET Passport at a participating Web site. 

Use the e-mail address (craig.dean@enron.com) and password you provided during registration to sign in instantly at any .NET Passport-enabled Web site that displays the .NET Passport sign-in button. 

If you also created a Passport wallet, you can use it to make faster, easier purchases at sites that offer the Passport express purchase service. (If you didn't create a Passport wallet and you would like to, we'll tell you how below.) 

You can see a list of .NET Passport sites at: http://www.passport.com/directory.asp.

The rest of this e-mail message contains important information about how to use your .NET Passport. You may want to refer back to it on occasion, so please save it or print a copy.

TO SIGN IN AND SIGN OUT AT A .NET Passport-ENABLED SITE

TO SIGN IN, click the ".NET Passport sign in" button on the site, and then type your e-mail address and password in the sign-in box that appears. You can sign in to some .NET Passport-enabled sites simply by typing your e-mail address and password directly in the .NET Passport sign-in box on that site's home page (without first clicking the .NET Passport sign-in button).

After you sign in to one .NET Passport-enabled site, you can sign in to any other just by clicking the ".NET Passport sign in" button on each site. 

TO SIGN OUT, click the ".NET Passport sign out" button on the site. Clicking this button at any site will sign you out of all .NET Passport-enabled sites.

TO CREATE YOUR PASSPORT WALLET AND USE PASSPORT EXPRESS PURCHASE

You need a Passport wallet to use the Passport express purchase service. A Passport wallet is a secure, convenient way to store your credit card and billing/shipping address information online.

You can create your Passport wallet now at: https://wallet.passport.com.

To make an online purchase using the information stored in your Passport wallet, click the "Passport express purchase" button at a participating site, sign in to .NET Passport (if you're not already signed in), and choose which credit card and shipping address you want to use. Your information will be sent to the site instantly, over a secure connection.

IF CLICKING A LINK DOESN'T WORK...

Copy it, and then paste it into your Web browser's address bar. 
Select the entire link (which starts with http:// and may include more than one line) and then copy it, usually by clicking the "Edit" menu item and then clicking "Copy". Next, open your Web browser and click in the box where you usually see the Web page address. Paste the link into this box (usually by clicking "Paste" in the "Edit" menu) and click "Go" or "Enter". 

Thank you for using your .NET Passport!
