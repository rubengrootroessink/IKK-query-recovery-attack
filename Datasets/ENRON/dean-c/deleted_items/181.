What??  You're not coming in on Friday???  Lori, Jeff and I get in around 4 on
Friday.  Brenda is driving in around 3 on Friday too.  And yes, my man is
coming with me.  He actually found out that a fraternity brother of his from
San Francisco is flying in for the game.  It is going to be so fun!!  I am
psyched.  Julie called yesterday and was so excited.  You have to come on
Friday night.  That will be the best night!!
