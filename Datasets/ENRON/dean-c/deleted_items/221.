Texas-Oklahoma Game Set for 2:30 P. M., National ABC Telecast

The big showdown next week between top five powers Texas and Oklahoma in
Dallas has been set for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff and will be televised nationally
by ABC.
Both teams are unbeaten, but both face tough tests this week. The Sooners,
ranked No. 3 nationally, face No. 11 Kansas State, and the Longhorns, ranked
No. 5, play unbeaten Texas Tech.

Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorn offense has been steadily
improving this season, but he said the defense has reverted to last year's
problem of being victimized by what he called "off-schedule plays." You and I
call those misdirection plays, but, by any terminology, they were a major
problem for the Texas defense in Saturday night's 53-26 victory at Houston.
"We have to do a better job on off-schedule plays," Brown said. "We're going
to work on that a lot this week. We need to tackile better and we need to do
a better job of recognizing what the other team is doing."
With Texas Tech and Oklahoma, two teams who love misdirection, filling the
next two spots on the schedule, it could be fatal to the Longhorns' lofty
ambitions unless they show a lot of improvement in tackling and recognizing
misdirection plays.
Texas leads the Big 12 in scoring, averaging 46 points per game, but Tech is
No. 2 with a 42-point average.
Brown said the Longhorns have to get a much better defensive performance
against Tech than they got against Houston "or we'll get beat."
He also said Texas will have a real challenge in trying to corral Tech QB
Kliff Kingsbury, one of the nation's top passers, and TB Ricky Williams, who
is averaging 74.5 yards per game rushing and is the Big 12's leading
receiver, averaging 10 catches per game for 95 yards.
"He's very dangerous on those short passes," Brown said of Williams. "He's
completely healthy for the first time in a long time and he's one of the most
dangerous backs in the country."
Linebackers have to do a good job on Williams or he has a big day. Since
linebacker play is not a strength on this Longhorn team, we need to hope the
Texas offense has a great day.
I think freshman LB Derrick Johnson is already the team's best linebacker,
but he didn't see any first-half action at Houston. He made an immediate
impact when he came in early in the third quarter.
Brown said Johnson and RB Cedric Benson are potentially great players, but he
said both "have only been going to class in college for about two or three
weekis." He said the coaches have to simplify offensive and defensive
assignments when they play because they haven't had time to learn everything
they need to know.
"Derrick is so talented and he has a real nose for the ball," Brown said.
"He's one of the best athletes coming out of high school that I've seen." But
he said defensive coordinator Carl Reese "has a pretty complicated system and
we're bringing him along as fast as we can."
He said Johnson and Benson will see more action as the season progresses and
they learn more about their assignments.

RECRUITING NOTES: Texas still has 14 commitments. The two super linebackers
who are still uncommitted - Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Marvin
Byrdsong of Longview - have had some changes in their list of favorites
recently. Harris had been a strong lean to Texas, but he told me today he
likes Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&M all about the same. "I don't really have
a favorite," he said. "They're all about even." But Byrdsong, who has a
brother at Mississippi State and who had been leaning toward the Bulldogs,
now says he really likes Texas. I think Texas can get both of them if the
Horns beat OU and A&M and if Byrdsong continues to make some progress in the
classroom. . . It looks like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos has a good chance
to keep his Longhorn scholarship. Brown shies away from problem kids as a
rule, but Anderson, who was arrested on two misdemeanor charges last week,
had never been in any trouble before and that will help him. He committed to
Texas several weeks ago. . . But the Longhorns don't appear likely to offer a
scholarship to the state's top WR, Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus,
because his latest suspension is just another in a long line of problems. By
the way, when I put stuff like this in my e-mail/faxes, I don't want to see
it on the internet. I can't give you the inside scoop on things like this if
it goes public because these kids and their coaches read the internet and it
could hurt the Longhorns' recruiting. I want to give you the true picture,
but I can't if you don't cooperate on this.
