Go RAMS !

For all St Louis folks I'm looking to extend our 
Thanksgiving holiday one more night.  
I'd like to give thanks for St. Louis getting rid of 
Bill Bidwell and the Cardinals.  

I'd also like to give thanks to the RAMS for tonight's 
win!

I would invite people to our comfy abode but our TV SUX, 
so no NFL at the home.

This is terribly late notice, so RSVP via 318 2991 if 
you're headed to Claudia's and I'll meet you there.

I'm sure most of you got up on the mountain this 
weekend, so there wasn't a lot of football around.
I got in the better part of Sunday morning, and the 
conditions should just get better over the week.
Looks like Saturday is a definite, any takers for 
Meadows ?

Tis the season,

PK
