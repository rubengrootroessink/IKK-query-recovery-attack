As we discussed at the recent RMS meeting, TXU is wanting to move forward
with a contingency plan to provide the 867_03 meter read data to REPs in
the event that ERCOT is unable to pass them on. The attached document
describes how we propose to accomplish this. I will be available for
questions at Wednesday's RMS meeting.
