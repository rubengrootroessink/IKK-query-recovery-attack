Thanks, Dave.  Many of you that are literate in EDI will be able to
fully understand what this document tells you, but there are many
reading this document that will not have a clue.  I have therefore asked
Dave to prepare a "higher" level document that states the major
functionality changes/differences in the various transactions; e.g.,
814, 810, 867, 650, etc.  Thanks.
