Dear Longhorns,

One more tip to try to make it easier to get tickets for Saturday's game.


First, go to:

www.ebay.com

Then click on Search and enter "UT tickets" or "Big 12 tickets" and make sure
you click the box "Search Description". One guy who has been there says that
will get you a bunch of them.
