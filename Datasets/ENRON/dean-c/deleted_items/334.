I have attached a template for each Market Participant (one per company)
to respond to the pros, risks, risk mitigation,  and contingency plans
for each option that was presented.  If I can have these back by noon,
tomorrow then I can combine them for review on Wednesday.  Please let me
know if you have any questions.
