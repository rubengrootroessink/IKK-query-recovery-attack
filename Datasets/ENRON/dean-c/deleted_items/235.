	The Hilton Austin Airport has lowered the ERCOT parking rate and
ERCOT hotel room rate.  When you attend an ERCOT meeting at the
Hilton,
tell the parking attendant which meeting you attended and tell them
it
was with ERCOT and your parking will only be $3.

	In addition,  the Hilton Airport Hotel recently lowered our
ERCOT rate for a room.  Our rate went from $149 to $99 for an
executive
or deluxe room which includes one king bed (or 2 doubles), ironing
board, hairdryer, shaving mirror, 2 phones, internet high speed
access,
and a work desk.  The hotel is located right next to the Austin
Airport
and includes a restaurant.  Call 512-385-6767 to make reservations
with
the Hilton and be sure to mention ERCOT to get the preferred rate.
