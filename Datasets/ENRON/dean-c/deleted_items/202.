Tyler DB Melton is 16th Commitment; DE Thornton Will Start Saturday

Tyler DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43, told me tonight he committed to Texas
earlier in the day "because I knew I wanted to stay in state and, after
visiting A&M and Texas (unofficially), I just like Texas better."
Melton, who has 40 tackles and two interceptions so far this year, said he
had offers "from about 15 or 16 schools, including Texas, A&M, Purdue, TCU,
Baylor and West Virginia."
Melton is the 16th recruit to commit to Texas. He is a member of my Fabulous
50.
The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are
listed on one or more national top 100 teams. They are  WR Marquis Johnson,
6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase
Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel; LB Garnett Smith, 6-3, 221,
4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of
San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, the
two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;  OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4,
310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of Allen;  and TE
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;  Davis made all of the
top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT  Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.

DE Kalen Thornton, who missed the OSU game with a knee sprain, is practicing
again this week and defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he will start
Saturday, with Maurice Gordon moving back to DT. Reese also said sophomore
Adam Doiron, who started at tackle against OSU in Gordon's place, played well
against the Cowboys and will see a lot of action against Colorado.
He also said redshirt freshman Stevie Lee "has had his best two days of
practice" this week and also will play at DT. Lee is under 300 pounds now. He
reported at about 310 because he was recovering from a broken bone in his
foot that required surgery and wasn't able to run and work out as much as
usual.
DE O. J. McClintock, who has been out all year after suffering severe cuts to
his right arm and hand in a household accident before the season, also is
expected to play Saturday.
Reese said the Longhorn will need lot of defensive linemen to step up
Saturday because Colorado "just lines up and tries to run over you play after
play."

The Longhorns' game at Missouri next Saturday will have a 2:30 p.m. kickoff
and UT officials say it will be available in Texas on pay-per-view TV, but
they said they are still working out the details. It was passed over for
regular TV programming, so pay-per-view is the only way fans who can't attend
will be able to see it.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: DE Bryan Pickryl, 6-5, 230, 4.5, of Oklahoma powerhouse
Jenks, plans to come to the Texas-Colorado game this weekend. He said Texas,
Missouri and Oklahoma are his top three teams, but he also said he is
considering several other schools fairly seriously. His maternal grandmother
lives in Austin and he also has two uncles in the Austin area., so he has
spent some time in this area. Other top prospects who say they will be coming
to the Colorado game include RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, OL Justin
Blalock of Plano East and LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite . . DT Earl
Anderson of San Marcos says he is solidly committed to Texas and says he is
being misquoted by people who say he plans to take visits to other schools. .
. WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus was held out of last week's game
after missing school and reporting he was sick. FM coach Randy Mayes said he
isn't sure if Timmons will play this week. "It depends on whether he misses
any more school or practices," he said. Timmons is a great football prospect,
and is by far the best WR in Texas, but he has had some disciplinary problems
and it seems they are continuing. But, as Mayes said, maybe he really was
sick.

Brown Says Buffs Pose Real Problem; No TV for Game at Missouri

Coach Mack Brown said  Monday Colorado will be the best running team Texas
will see this year and he also said the Buffaloes have the best offensive
line the Horns will face.
The two teams play at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in a game that will be televised
regionally by ABC. The Longhorns, 5-1, are a 10-point favorite over the
Buffaloes, also 5-1.
Brown said DE Kalen Thornton, who missed the Oklahoma State game with a
sprained knee, is expected to return to practice Tuesday and he said that is
very good news because Colorado has such a powerful running game that the
Longhorns will need every available defensive lineman to try to stop it.
"This is the best running team we have seen since the last time we played
Nebraska," he  said. "They have a big, physical line, and some big, physical
backs."
He said Oklahoma uses its passing game to set up its running game. He said
Colorado is the opposite. "They run to set up their play-action passes," he
said. "They have a very good offense, and their quarterback (Craig) Ochs is a
good passer and he can hurt you running. We'll have a battle."
The Longhorns probably will be back in their basic 4-3 defense against the
run-oriented Buffs, and Brown said sophomore DT Adam Doiron, who started
against Oklahoma State, "played really well" and will start again. Fellow
sophomore Marcus Tubbs is a fixture at the other tackle spot.
If Thornton is able to return, Brown said that will give the coaches freedom
to use Maurice Gordon at end or tackle. Gordon, a former end, was a starting
tackle until Thornton got hurt, and then he moved back to end.
He said the Longhorns have to work hard to run a lot against Colorado's tough
run defense because "they like to dominate time of possession with their
running game and just wear the other team down. We try to wear the other team
down, too, so that's going to be interesting."
The Longhorns have won 11 straight games at home. That is the longest home
winning streak since the early 1980s. They also are 19-2 at home since Brown
took over.
Brown said true freshman RB Cedric Benson will start and Ivan Williams also
will play quite a bit against Colorado. "Cedric did a good job," Brown said,
"and Ivan did  well when he came in late. We want Cedric to get a lot of
carries, but probably not 31 like he got against Oklahoma State. We'll
probably spread it out a little more."
He also said TE Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards are going to start getting more
chances to catch passes. "They can really run, and we've got to work them
into the offense a little more and give them more chances," he said.
* * * *
The Longhorns 'game at Missouri on October 27 was not chosen for TV, but UT
officials have asked the Missouri athletic director to approve a pay TV
arrangement for some Texas cities. The game time would have to be 2:30 p.m.
or later to be approved for pay TV because the Big 12 has a rule that
prohibits any league game telecast conflicting with the sanctioned telecast,
which begins at 11 a.m. UT officials expect to get an answer from Missouri
officials Tuesday. This will be the first Longhorn game this season that was
not chosen for TV, and it is the longest road trip this season. Ironically,
the two longest Big 12 trips last year - to Colorado and Kansas - were not
chosen for TV either. So much for all that famed UT clout with the TV
networks.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES:  The Longhorns are still at 15 commitments. One of them is
a little shaky. LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar says he plans to sign
with Texas, but might take a couple of visits. When kids take visits, the
commitments are shaky. We'll have to see what develops in regard to Smith and
his pledge to UT. . . Texas has pledges from five players on my 25-man
"diffefrence maker" list, including No. 4 DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, No.
11 LB Smith, No. 17 LB Brian Robison of Splendora, No. 23 OL Brett Valdez of
Brownwood and No. 24 QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar. The Horns have
a pretty good shot at every member of the top seven on that list - No. 1 DT
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, No. 2 QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison,
No. 3 DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, No. 5 DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands,
No. 6 RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park and No. 7 LB Aaron Harris of North
Mesquite. The won't get all of that group, but they might get most of them.
