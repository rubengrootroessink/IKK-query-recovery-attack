Gentlemen,
I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.  

Airproducts [Curry, Mike]   - north(dallas) max=24mw min=10mw, south (houston)max=224mw min=123mw 
Alcoa [Curry, Mike]   - 25 MW in the south (valley - point comfort) 
BOC gases
Corrugated Services
Crown
Huntsman
Kinder Morgan
Koch
Praxair [Curry, Mike]   - South(reliant) max=115mw min=90mw, South(TNMP)-5mw 
TotalFina

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks, 
Clint
