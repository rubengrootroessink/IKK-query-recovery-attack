Please plan to meet at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday for an informal question/answer session.  The best place to gather is in the rows between Trading and Origination.  Chris Calger will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I will be conducting the session.

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.
