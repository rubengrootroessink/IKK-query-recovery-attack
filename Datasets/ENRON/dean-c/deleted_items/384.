Are y'all good for Saturday?  If possible, I would like to do something centrally located so neither of us have to drive forever.  Also, see if Melissa and her husband would be interested in joining us.  It would be great to see her.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

Sure, I think that works out fine.  My parents are coming over to help us
paint the nursery on Friday but we should be done that day, unless of
course, they make a horrible mess & we have to deep clean the house on
Saturday!  So, let me check with Michael & I'll let you know.  Yeah!
