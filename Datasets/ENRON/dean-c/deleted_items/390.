Dear CLINT,
It was nice talking to you today. Thank you for your willingness to help me.    If you think of anyone that fits the qualifications or would be a good person to network with, please email their names and phone numbers. Naturally I will keep your name confidential. I hope to reciprocate some day. Please keep my e-business card on file for exciting career opportunities in the energy industry. Thanks again.
Have A Great Day.
Todd
