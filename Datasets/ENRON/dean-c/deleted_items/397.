Ticket sales for Saturday's Big 12 Championship Game between No. 5 Texas
(10-1/7-1 Big 12) and No. 14 Colorado (9-2/7-1 Big 12) opened at 10 a.m.
Sunday, Nov. 25. To order tickets, call 800/982-BEVO (2386) or 512/471-3333.
The UT ticket office will stay open until 5 p.m. and will reopen Mondayat
8:30 a.m. Prices are $60 and $70. The deadline to place your order for next
weekend's game is Monday at 7 p.m. (CT). Expect delays on phone orders due to
the large number of callers.

Only 8,250 tickets were given to each of the the two competing teams. Tickets
will be available to Texas season ticket holders who are Longhorn Foundation
members, football letterwinners or voting faculty members. Ten percent of the
tickets will be set aside for student ticket orders.

If you can't get a ticket through normal channels, a lot of disappointed
Nebraska and Oklahoma fans (HOW SWEET IT IS) are going to be selling the ones
they bought through the conference office earlier. Check the newspaper ads
and the internet sites.

Hook 'em,
