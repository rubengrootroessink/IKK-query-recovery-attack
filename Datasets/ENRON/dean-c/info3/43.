I met with the Research team responsible for building a model for EES and ran through the model. The model can be used to value ERCOT deals or at least we can use it as a benchmark for pricing. I have attached a document that summarizes what EES is using the model to price, and how we can use it to price our deals. I am out tomorrow but will be back in the office Wed. morning. Research is looking at historical ERCOT prices and customer load data (TXI). I will set up a meeting on Wednesday to further discuss the model and other issues associated with deal valuation.
