Clint-

Actually, Melissa isn't working anymore, at an office that is, she's working
from home.  Her email is mma_ike@yahoo.com.

So, what's been going on with you?  Is everything okay?  I haven't heard
from you in a long time and I'm sorry I haven't done a better job of keeping
in touch.  This whole baby thing is really keeping us busy!  We found out a
couple of weeks ago that it's a girl!  So, we're excited about that!  I need
your opinion on picking her name.  We've narrowed it down to two choices.
Let me know which one you like better-

Jenna Elizabeth Hood  	 Jenna Hood

Caitlin Elizabeth Hood	 Caitlin Hood

Your input would help us.  We've asked a lot of people and everyone seems to
generally like both so I'm curious to hear what you think.

Things have been crazy around here...Melissa is expecting a little girl in
about 6 weeks.  Marisa is busy with her little boy, Wade.  And, Michelle is
separated from her husband & considering divorce only after 4 mo. of
marriage.  So, we've all been dealing with a lot of personal stuff.

Anyways, I hope you can come visit soon.  We'd love to go out to dinner
again.  Hope all is well with your job and your love life.  Any new Jen's?
HA!

Well, take care and write back soon.

Love, Amy
