> LB Smith Commits to Texas Because of Nicer People, Better Academics
>
> LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar,  told me this
> afternoon
> (Wednesday) he has committed to Texas and plans to stick with his
> commi8tment.
> "I talked to coach (Mack) Brown, coach (Carl Reese) and coach(Bruce)
> Chambers
> last night and told them all I want to be a Longhorn," he said. "I'm sure

> now. I am solid on this. I definitely know where I want to go and it is
> Texas."
> Smith said, "I want to go where I will be happy, and I feel like I will
be
>
> happy in Austin. The Texas people have said nothing but nice things to
me,
>
> even when they thought I was committed to Oklahoma, but the OU people
> haven't
> been that nice."
> He also is a good student who said he had never realized how much
> difference
> there is in the two schools academically until he looked at an academic
> rating of colleges. "Oklahoma just can't compare to Texas academically,"
> he
> said.
> Smith  said his head coach and several of his assistant coaches are
> Oklahoma
> graduates and have been "pushing me to go to Oklahoma."
> Folks, I lived in Oklahoma for 18 years while working as a political and
> investigative reporter for The Associated Press, and, unless things have
> changed a great deal there, coaches with degrees from Texas would  not be

> able to keep their jobs if an Oklahoma kid said they were trying to push
> him
> to sign with Texas.
> I don't think the Arlington Lamar coaches should be hit that hard, but if
>
> you live in that school district or have friends who do, it might be a
> good
> idea to tell them to tell those coaches to cool it. I don't think a kid's

> coaches should pressure him to attend a certain school.
> Smith denied ever committing to  Oklahoma. "The commitment to Texas is
the
>
> only commitment I have made," he said, "and I intend to keep it."
> Smith is the closest thing out there this year to sensational Longhorn
> freshman LB Derrick Johnson. Look for them to be outstanding outside
> backers,
> one on the weakside and one on the strongside, for years to come at UT.
> The Longhorns have 13 commitments and probably will get No. 14 Sunday,
> when
> super DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel announces his college choice

> before his church congregation. It's between Texas and LSU and I will be
> very
> surprised if picks the Tigers.
> The other 12 recruits who have committed to UT are DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
> 320,
> 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
> Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of

> Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in
Arizona,
>
> and Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller; LBs Brian Robison, 6-3,
245,
>
> 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of Pflugerville
> Connally;
> OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5,
> 260,
> 4.9, of Allen;  TE-LB David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;
> WR
> Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don
> Malone,
> 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North Lamar;  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190,

> 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
> Seven of the players - Smith, Davis, Anderson, Sendlein, Valdez, Tweedie
> and
> Thomas - have been on one or more national top 100 lists. Davis was on
all
>
> the lists last year. If Pittman comes aboard Sunday, that will give the
> Longhorns eight players who have been on national top 100 lists.
> After watching tape of two games Malone played in, I think he is a lot
> better
> than most recruiting services have him rated. He has good size, a good
> arm,
> good mobility, and, most important of all, he seems to read defenses
> extremely well. That is the quality that separates great quarterbacks
from

> good quarterbacks at the college level.
> If you have quality wide receivers, at least one of them is always going
