What's up dude?? Long time no talk.? I  see from your email you are at Enron 
now.? I don't think I have talked to  you since April or something like 
that.? We should really talk more often,  go get a beer/dinner after work 
sometime.? I switched jobs as well, went to  a competitor (AccountPros).? 
Looks like we both took better opportunities  at our competitor companies.? I 
hope all is going well.? Sounds like  we may all go camping soon.? I don't 
know if 1111 is still on, or if I'm  going.? What are your plans regarding 
that trip?
