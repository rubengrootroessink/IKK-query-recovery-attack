Kansas Game Set for 1 p.m., No TV; Brown Says Tech Dangerous Foe

The Longhorns' game next week at Kansas has been set for 1 p.m. with no
television. This is the second faraway game this year that has not been
televised. The other one was at Colorado.
Folks, one of the primary reasons that was given for the Longhorns playing
Louisiana-Lafayette with that ridiculous 11 a.m. kickoff back in early
September when it was hot as blazes was that the TV brass appreciated Texas
making an extra effort and would reciprocate down the line.
Well, it hasn't happened. The Baylor-A&M game was shown in place of the
Texas-Colorado game back on Oct. 14. Any big Baylor or A&M fans could make
it
to Waco a lot easier than Longhorn fans could make it to Boulder.
Don't let anyone tell you that UT has any extra pull with the TV guys. When
neither of our two longest Big 12 road trips get picked up by TV, that
tells
you we have zero stroke with the networks.
Last season, 12 of Texas' 14 games were televised. So far this season, 5 of
8 have been televised. We're already worse off than last year with three
regular season games to go.
And don't bank on pay-per-view. The Big 12 contract with ABC doesn't allow
pay-per-view that would conflict with the ABC college telecasts.

Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorns are in for a terrific battle in
Lubbock Saturday night. He said the Raiders "run a no-huddle offense. They
might get 90 plays. We'd better have a bunch of guys ready to rush the
passer."
He said the Raiders throw on nearly every down, and he said the UT coaches
will play a lot of people on defense to try to keep fresh pass rushers in
the
game.
He also said the last three games of the season against Texas Tech  and
Kansas on the road and Texas A&M in Austin are all tough games. "I told the
players we could end up 6-5 or we could end up  9-2," he said. "I really
don't know."
Brown said the Longhorns are 5-5 in their last 10 trips to Lubbock. He is
0-1
in his one trip to Lubbock with the Longhorns because the Raiders took a
42-35 victory in 1998, the last time the Horns came to town. But Brown is
1-1
against the Raiders because Texas mauled Tech last year in Austin, 58-7.
Mike Leach, the Tech coach, was offensive coordinator at OU last year, and
Brown said, "Texas Tech runs the same offensive scheme that Oklahoma runs.
That should get our attention."
He said Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury "is one of the top quarterbacks in the
league and in the nation. He is much improved."
* * * *
It will be strength vs. strength when Kingsbury, the most prolific passer
in
Division I, throws against the Texas defense, which is No. 1 in the nation
in
pass efficiency with a very good 82.69 rating. The Longhorns also are 10th
in
passing yardage yielded, giving up just 168 yards per game.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorns are still at 19 commitments.
Super
safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple says he is pretty sure he will sign with
either Texas or Florida State. Super OL Jami Hightower of Jacksonville says
it is still a three-way race between Texas, A&M and Nebraska. He says he
plans to come to the Texas-A&M game.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Roy Williams has caught passes for a UT freshman record 514
yards this year and B. J. Johnson is close behind him with 446. Williams
also
is the leading freshman receiver in the nation in terms of yardage gained.
Lovell Pinkney held the UT freshman record. He had 458 yards as a freshman
in
1992. Johnson needs just 13 yards to pass Pinkney. . . The Longhorns are a
10-point favorite over Texas Tech. . . Only 7 of the players on UT's 44-man
depth chart are seniors.
