Freshmen Finish Strong; Varsity Reports Wednesday

The Longhorn freshmen practiced twice Tuesday, wrapping up their four
workouts as a group. The varsity players report Wednesday and the next
workout will involve the full team and will be Friday at 9 a.m. at Whitaker
Field (51st and Guadalupe).
Coach Mack Brown said he is very pleased with the freshmen, and he said at
least half of them probably will play this season.
He also released the official heights and weights on the freshmen. Here
they
are:
Trey Bates, 6-5, 285; Sneezy Beltran, 5-10, 205; Adam Doiron, 6-4, 260;
Brock
Edwards, 6-5, 265; Lionel Garr, 6-7, 335; Jason Glynn, 6-2, 275; Tony
Jeffery, 6-2, 170; B. J. Johnson, 6-1, 190; Will Matthews, 6-3, 235; Matt
McFadden, 5-11, 180; Chance Mock, 6-2, 205; Aurmon Satchell, 6-3, 220;
Austin
Sendlein, 6-3, 240; Justin Smith, 6-5, 185; Rashad Thomnas, 6-2, 235; Sloan
Thomas, 6-2, 195; Kalen Thornton, 6-3, 270; Nathan Vasher, 5-11, 170; Roy
Williams, 6-5, 210.
A couple of those heights and weights don't pass the eyeball test. Rashad
Thomas looks quite bit bigger than 235, and Roy Williams and Brock Edwards
appear to be closer to 6-3 or 6-4 than 6-5.
Johnson and Williams, the top receiving duo in the country last season
(both
were rated in the top 10 players overall by some services), both appeared
to
be fully recovered from injuries that hampered their workouts this simmer.
Johnson had a sprained ankle and Williams suffered a slight shoulder
separation in the Texas-California Shrine All-Star game.
Brown said Johnson appeared a little tentative in Monday's two workouts,
but
"he was going full speed today. I think he is totally well. And Roy
Williams'
shoulder isn't bothering him, either. Both of them appear to be totally
well."
TE Edwards, MLB Sendlein and DEs Doiron and Thornton are extremely quick
for
such big specimens.
Brown said QB Major Applewhite, who underwent knee surgery in the off
season,
has been cleared for contact and will work out with the rest of the team
Friday. he said WR Jamel Thompson, who suffered a knee injury in the spring
that required surgery, is the only player expected to miss the opening
practices. Thompson, a fifth-year senior backup, probably will get lost in
the shuffle if he does make it back by mid-season, because the heralded
freshmen WRs appear to be as good as advertised.

FOOTBALL NOTES: Look for the Longhorns' base defense to be a nickel package
next season. Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he plans to play a lot
of
nickel (five DBs) and dime (six DBs) this season. He said most of the teams
Texas plays are going to try to spread the field and play four wide
receivers
a lot. He said he will play four cornerbacks and two safeties when that
happens, with the four down linemen and middle linebacker also staying in
the
game. Reese likes MLB De'Andre Lewis and WLB Everick Rawls , but he said
unless Tyrone Jones or Marcus Wilkins steps up at SLB, "we'll be a little
more of a nickle team, because the SAM (strongside linebacker) is the one
who
comes out when we put another cornerback in." Reese also said he will use a
dime package when teams line up with four wideouts. He said the four
cornerbacks will play man for man against the wide receivers and the two
safeties "will line up in the box (close to the line of scrimmage)."

RECRUITING NOTES: Bret Rawls, the 6-5, 195-pound former wide receiver who
will succeed superstar Brock Berlin as the QB in the high octane Shreveport
Evangel offense, seems to be leaning Texas' way after earlier appearing to
be
a lock for LSU. He says he really likes the Texas offense. Since the
Longhorns only plan to take one QB and they are in one two very good ones

-
Rawls and Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch
- the scholarship appears
likely to go to the first one who says he is ready to commit.  Both came to
Texas summer camp. The Longhorns still have 12 early commitments.
