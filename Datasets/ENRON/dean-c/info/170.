Artie Ellis Should Be Back at Practice Wednesday After X-Ray

Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis, who suffered a stress fracture in his leg
in spring practice, was injured in Tuesday morning's Longhorn practice when
someone kicked him on the same leg. But coach Mack Brown said after the
evening workout that an X-Ray showed no damage. He said Ellis probably will
be back at practice Wednesday.
After losing TE Bo Scaife with a season-ending knee injury, the loss of
Ellis
would have been a severe blow to the team's receiving corps, and Brown said
he was elated when he found out the injury was minor. Ellis was held out of
the evening workout. Brown also said Scaife will undergo surgery on his
knee
Friday, and probably will be available for spring practice.

Brown said Tuesday's first practice in full pads was a very good one, and
he
said he is pleased with the second-team offense and defense.
"Last season, our first teams just went right through our second teams," he
said. "Our second teams are much better this year. The first teams can't
just
line up and ran over them anymore."
He also said the first-team offensive line played extremely well Tuesday.
Offensive line coach Tim Nunez said Cory Quye has edged ahead of Mike
Williams for the starting job at right tackle, but he said both Quye and
Williams "are having great practices."
Nunez also said backup guard Tillman Holloway, a redshirt freshman, "has
done
a great job and is pushing for significant playing time."
* * * *
Freshmen WRs Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson both made several outstanding
catches Tuesday. Both also ran with the first team at times due to Ellis'
absence.
I asked Brown how soon a true freshman could move into the starting lineup
if
he demonstrated that he was better than the veterans. He said, "As soon as
we
would see he's good enough to play consistently well. We wouldn't want to
move him up and then move him down, but if some of them play well enough to
move up, it probably would be next week."
There is no question right now that Williams and Ellis are the team's top
two
WRs, with Johnson close behind them. If Williams and Ellis are both healthy
on Sept. 9, expect them to be the starters in the season opener against
Louisiana-Lafayette.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said freshmen DEs Kalen Thornton and Adam
Doiron have been looking good in practice. He said both of them should be
able to help the team this season. "They are big old boys who should be
able
to help us stop the run," he said. "They both have good quickness and they
are catching on fast."

The Longhorns will have a scrimmage at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Royal Memorial
Stadium. Brown urged Longhorn fans to come and show their support for the
team.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Josh Doiron, older brother of the freshman DE, is walking
on
as a TE. He attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship, but
quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year. He did not play football at
OU. After sitting out this year at Texas, he will have two years of
eligibility remaining. . . Brown said Hodges Mitchell is the Longhorns' No.
1
punt returner and Ivan Williams and Victor Ike are the top kickoff
returners.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns might sign a kicker this year. They have
two
good freshmen kickers, but Brown likes to have competition at every spot,
and
he probably will sign a kicker if he can find a great one. He would like to
find a punter who also can kick field goals.
