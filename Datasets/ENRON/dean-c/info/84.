 Horns Land Strong-Armed QB, Swift Athlete as 5th, 6th Commitments

 Texas is up to six commitments already after getting pledges Monday from
 QB
 Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of Paris North Lamar, and RB/Athlete
 Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 (that 4.27 was clocked at the A&M Nike camp).

 Both athletes play in Class 4A.
 Malone and Haney both attended the UT mini-camp Sunday, then got offers
 Monday from the Longhorns due to the ridiculous new NCAA rule
 interpretation
 (same old rule, new legal interpretation) that doesn't allow kids to
 commit
 at summer camps. Normally, both would have been offered by coach Mack
 Brown
 at the conclusion of their mini-camp sessions.
 Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa State,

 TCU and SMU. He said ISU, TCU and SMU had offered, and North Lamar head
 coach
 Tom Felty said Tennessee, Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they
 were preparing to offer his prize pupil.
 Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado (offers)
 and
 several other schools who  were recruiting him.
 Malone, who has been All-District at quarterback and free safety and in
 basketball as a sophomore and junior, was the district's sophomore of the
 year in both sports.
 "He has a great arm," Felty said, "but what really makes him special is
 the
 way he sees the entire field. He can find his second and third receivers
 and
 he never just locks onto one guy. He's also a very physical player. That's

 what makes him such a fine free safety, and it also helps him at
 quarterback
 because he will hang in there until the last split second to get a
 completion
 even when he knows he's going to get decked."
 There have been some questions about Malone's speed, but Felty said, "We
 play
 in a district with a lot of fast players and I've never seen him caught
 from
 behind. He ran for 405 net yards rushing and four touchdowns, and he had
 more
 than that, but all quarterbacks get sacked and that brought his total
 down.
 He's a threat running or passing."
 His passing is what attracted the Longhorns. Playing for a young 6-4 team,
 he
 completed 106 of 202 passes (52.4%) for 15 touchdowns and had seven
 interceptions.
 Felty said Malone "really loves to play football. He even loves practice.
 Sometimes I have the second-team quarterback working and I see him over
 playing receiver for the scout team. He's ready to practice and ready to
 play
 every day."
 Malone said he is happy to be a Longhorn. "It's a dream come true," he
 said.
 "My coach told me he thought they were going to offer and I was hoping
 they
 would because I really want to play for the Longhorns."
 Asked what he thinks are his strong suits, he said, "I think I have a good

 arm and pretty good speed, but I think mental attitude is really important

 and I play hard and play to win all of the time."
 Haney, who rushed 266 times for 1,665 yards (6.25 yards per carry) and 19
 touchdowns, also was a big threat as a receiver, catching 9 passes for 205

 yards and four touchdowns for the 11-2 Ramgers. He said when he committed,

 "Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a football player. He told me

 they want fast, athletic kids and they would find a spot for me after I
 get
 there."
 That spot could be running back, but it probably will be wide receiver or
 defensive back.
 Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class 4A playoffs last year,
 and
 Haney said San Marcos' defensive tackle Earl Anderson, another UT pledge,
 "is
 really fast to be so big. I broke about a 40-yard touchdown run in that
 game
 and he was right behind me most of the way. I'm glad we're going to be on
 the
 same side at Texas."
 Asked why he picked the Longhorns, he said, "Texas has great facilities
 and
 great coaches and it's a first-class academic institution." With a 93.4
 grade
 average and a qualifying test score already, he said the way the Longhorn
 coaches stressed academics along with athletics was a big factor in his
 decision."
 The Longhorns' other commitments are from OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood, DT

 Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and DT Sonny Davis, who signed with
 Texas last year, but is having to go to a junior college in Mississippi
 because he failed to qualify academically. Davis said he did so well in
 his
 first year in the JC that he has a chance to graduate in time to enroll at

 Texas next January and go through spring practice.
 My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant.
