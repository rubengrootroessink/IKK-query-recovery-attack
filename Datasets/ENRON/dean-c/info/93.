> Benson Impressive in Full Pads, Already Working with Second Team
>
> Freshman RB Cedric Benson had some impressive runs Wednesday night in the

> Longhorns' first workout in full pads.
> Benson set high school records that almost defy description, like five
> touchdowns in three straight state championship games, but the UT roster
> is
> full of high school stars and none of that counts when they reach the
next
>
> level.
> Benson looked a little tentative the first two times he carried the ball
> Wednesday night, but then he reverted to the explosive running style that

> made him famous at Midland Lee, simply exploding through the hole on play

> after play. He also put on a good cutback move to make five yards on an
> end
> sweep that appeared to be going nowhere.
> It's too early to say he's the answer to the Longhorns' running back
> problems, but he certainly made a good start in his first opportunity to
> impress the coaches. He's already playing a lot with the second team.
> Junior OT Robbie Doane, apparently stung by the coaches' decision to
train
>
> guard Derrick Dockery at his spot, too, because they felt it needed to be

> strengthened, had the best practice of his career. He even pancaked star
> DE
> Kalen Thornton once in the one-on-one drills in which the defensive
> linemen
> try to get past the offensive linemen to sack the quarterback.
> The best hit of the Wednesday night practice was one safety Phillip
> Geiggar
> put on star WR Roy Williams as Williams was grabbing a pass across the
> middle. Geigger whacked him so hard Williams went one way and the ball
> went
> the other way.
> Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he plans to shuffle four ends and
> four
> tackles against the passing teams on the Longhorns' schedule. He said
> Marcus
> Tubbs will be one of his starting tackles and he said the other one will
> be
> Maurice Gordon against passing teams and Stevie Lee or Adam Doiron
against
>
> running teams.
> He said DEs Thornton and Cory Redding will start agains everybody, but he

> said converted linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins will play a lot
> against the passing teams.
> Reese also said he has been very impressed with freshman CB Aaron Ross
and
>
> might use him when he plays five defensive backs against the
pass-oriented
>
> teams. He also said Cedric Griffin, another freshman CB, has looked good
> since his return from a sprained ankle and might figure in the rotation.
> Head coach Mack Brown said sophomore WR B. J. Johnson  "is starting to
> play
> like he did in high school, making guys miss and picking up big yardage
> after
> the catch." Johnson was rated as the nation's top wide receiver recruit
by
>
> several national recruiting services, but has been overshadowed at Texas
> by
> fellow sophomore Williams, who broke UT's true freshman record for
> receiving
> yardage last season.
> The Longhorn coaches have put in more sweeps and misdirection plays to
> make
> the offense less predictable, and, on defense, new secondary coach Duane
> Aki
> na has put in some new coverages designed to confuse opposing
quarterbacks
>
> by making a zone defense out of what looks like a man-for-man defense and

> vice versa.
> The sweeps are a big help for starting TB Victor Ike, the fastest running

> back in the UT stable. He can run inside, but he is very dangerous on
> sweeps
> because of his outstanding speed.
> Akina also said his defensive backs at Texas have more talent than most
of
>
> the great defenses he coached at Arizona in the famed "Desert Swarm"
> defense.
> He said there are several DBs at Texas who have pro potential after their

> college careers are over.
> The Longhorns will have their first full scrimmage of the pre-season
> Thursday
> at 3 p.m. in Royal Memorial Stadium. Then they will practice at 8:30 a.m.
> and
> 7 p.m. Friday at the Denius Fields before having a second scrimmage at 9
> a.m.
> Saturday in Royal Memorial Stadium.

> RECRUITING NOTES: The three-game suspension drawn by the state's top wide

> receiver, Robert Timmons of  Flower Mound Marcus, is not his first brush
> with
> trouble and probably will cause the Longhorns to slow down  their efforts
> to
> recruit him. Brown shies away from problem athletes generally, and
Timmons
>
> drawing a suspension for an unidentified offense is a real negative.
> Obviously, this is not something I would like to see quoted on the
> internet.
> I try to be frank with all of you, but it would not be helpful to UT for
> this
> to be bandied about publicly. . . The Longhorns still have 12
commitments.

> There are some great recruits like LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, RB
> Aaron Hardy of Galena Park, DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, DT-OG
> Kasey
> Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., and WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign,
> Ill., who are national top 100 players who strongly favor the Horns, but,
> of
> that grolup, only Johnson is likely to commit in the near future. He
plans

> try to come to the Horns' opener on his official visit and is a good bet
> to
> commit when he does.
