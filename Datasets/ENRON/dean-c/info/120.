Baby,

You're so sweet for emailing me and saying such sweet things!  Do you know
that you brightened up my day?

I only have about 30 hours of school left.  I did okay on my test.  I should
have studied a little more, but I just didn't feel like it.  I'm feeling
comfortable about my project due tomorrow.  I find out tomorrow if I have to
take my optional final because I get my grade pre-final.  I don't know if I
should take the final if I have a B in the class.  I guess I'll figure it
out!

I slept a lot last night - almost 7.5 hours.  So, I feel more up to the
challenge of the next 2 days.  I'm also not as cranky!

I'm gonna send out a lot of the announcements today.  Mom emailed me the
rest of the addresses today, so I'll either do the rest tonight or tomorrow.

I'm going to tell Mom that I'm going to Houston this weekend.  I decided
that I should tell her since I may sign a lease next week.

Anyway, I've gotta continue on my project!

Love you,
Jenn
