Injury Update

Junior DE O. J. McClintock suffered slashed muscles and tendons in his right
arm in a household accident and underwent surgery the week before practice
started. He is expected to miss three or four games.
Junior WR Kyle Shanahan, a walk-on who is being counted on provide some key
receptions, suffered a puncture wound in his thigh while trying to leap over
a fence just a few days before practice started. Coach Brown says he might be
back before the opener.
Senior LB Tyrone Jones (bruised shoulder), freshman CB Cedric Griffin
(sprained ankle) and freshman safety Rufus Harris (sore quad) are expected
back at practice this week.
Sophomore CB Monti Collier (strained hamstring) and freshman RB Anthony
Johnson (stress fracture in foot) are out indefinitely.
On the plus side, redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee seems to be completely
recovered after his off-season foot surgery.

Two Veterans Missing

Sophomore TE Artie Ellis and senior LB Jon Wyndham are not on the team this
year. Ellis, who is trying to recover from a persistent shin injury, says he
will return in January. Wyndham never redshirted, so he has another year of
eligibility, but he probably won't be back.

Projected 2001 Longhorn Football Roster By Class, Position

This is a  list of  scholarship football players by class (eligibility) for
the 2001 season. Players in  bold are returning starters. Some positions list
more than one starter because a starter was injured and another player took
his place. At tight end for example, I list three starters because Bo Scaife
was due to start until he was hurt, then Mike Jones started until he was
injured and then
Brock Edwards started. Freshman running back Cedric Benson is not counted in
the scholarship total because he is a professional baseball player and is not
eligible for a football scholarship. Sophomore tight end Artie Ellis is not
in school this semester and is not on the list, but he is due to return for
the spring semester.

UT Recruit Stars in AAU

Heather Schrieber, the 6-3 Windthorst star who will be a freshman at Texas
this year, led her AAU team to the championship of the national Basketball
Coaches' Association tournament and was named the tourney MVP after averaging
29 points a game in the tourney.
The Longhorn women are off to a good start in this year's recruiting with a
pledge from point guard Nina Norman, a  5-8 star at Jersey Village who is
ranked as a national top 50 player.
Two other players Texas was recruiting have committed to other schools. Guard
Chelsi Welch, who led Plainview to the state Class 4A title last year, picked
Oklahoma, and Lindsey Harding, a  5-7 guard from Cypress Falls, who also is a
national top 50 player, chose Duke.
