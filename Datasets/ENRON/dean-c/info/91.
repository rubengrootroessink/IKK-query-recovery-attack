> Running Game, Offensive Line Look Stout in Second Scrimmage
>
> When you have first-team guys going against second-team guys, it's hard
to
>
> get a real feel for how things are progressing, but I am going to predict

> right now that the Longhorns are going to be much better at running the
> ball
> in big games this season than they did last year.
> That is not going out on a really big limb, because the Horns simply had
> no
> rushing game in big games last season.
> But the reasons I think they will be able to run the ball better when
they
>
> need to this year are based on three sound reasons:
> 1. The scheme is better. The team is working more on run blocking and has

> diversified to the extent that it's hard to predict what the offense will
> do.
> Last year, it seemed there were only two running plays - tailback off
left
>
> tackle and tailback off right tackle. Coach Mack Brown also is more
> determined to make the running game more dependable.
> 2. The offensive line is more experienced and healthier. Guard Antwan
> Kirk-Hughes is an outstanding lineman when he is healthy, but he had a
bad
>
> shoulder  all last season. Guard-tackle Derrick Dockery also is very
good,
>
> but he lost 40 pounds last season when he had a viral infection he
> couldn't
> shake. Both of them are healthy and it is making a lot of difference in
> the
> quality of offensive line play.
> 3. The arrival of heralded recruit Cedric Benson has raised the level of
> play
> of the other tailbacks. Benson has already shown he will be one of the
> mainstays of the running game. He's powerful, fast, elusive, durable and
> has
> the field vision that all great running backs have, which means he sees
> the
> hole and, if there is no hole, he sees the softest spot and hits it with
> lightning speed. Ivan Williams, a 245-pound tank every spring and a
> 245-pound
> patsy every fall, has showed up in his tank form this fall. He has been
> very
> impressive, running with speed, power and determination. The starting
> tailback, speedster Victor Ike, is sporting new muscles and is running
> with
> more determination and consistency. He also is getting to run some
sweeps.
>
> With Ike in the backfield, sweeps can be deadly and they also can keep
the
>
> defense from concentrating its forces between the tackles. Look for all
> three
> guys to get close to equal time, at least early in the season.
> Okay, enough of the analysis, let's talk about the scrimmage. Junior QB
> Chris
> Simms completed six of 10 passes for 72 yards and two touchdownhs, all
> against the second-team defense. He would have been three-for-three in
> touchdowns, but he slightly overthrew WR Sloan Thomas, who was wide open,
> on
> his third and final drive.
> Coach Mack Brown worked the starters only about 30 plays in the 100-play
> scrimmage, saying he wanted to look at the reserves to determine which
> ones
> need to be move up and which ones need to be demoted.
> Senior QB Major Applewhite, working with the second team against the
> first-team defense, completed 5 of 9 passes for 50 yardes, with one
> interception. Redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock was 2 of 6 for 27 yards,
> but
> he was very impressive with his running. For a 6-2, 220-pound
quarterback,
> he
> has remarkable speed.
> Williams led the rushing with 9 carries for 32 yards, followed by Sneezy
> Beltran with 9 for 31, Benson 7 for 23 and Ike 3 for 18. Benson already
is
>
> the best of the group at making something out of nothing. It takes a
> head-on
> tackle to get him down and he's difficult to hit head on.
> Sophomore WRs B. J. Johnson and Roy Williams caught the TD passes from
> Simms.
> Johnson's was a 38-yard TD play and Williams' catch was a  seven-yarder.
> Defensively, ends Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and freshman linebacker

> Derrick Johnson were outstanding.
> The Longhorns open the season two weeks from today and most of the
> starting
> positions are set.
> Nine starters return on offense and Ike will be the starter at tailback.
> At
> left tackle, the job is still open. Dockery might slide over to tackle.
He
>
> has been working at tackle and guard. If he moves to tackle, Tillman
> Holloway
> will start at guard in his place. Robbie Doane and Alfio Randall also are

> trying to win the starting job at left tackile.
> Eight starters are back on defense, but safety Lee Jackson has moved to
> linebacker, creating another open position. The Horns have to replace two

> starting tackles and two starting safeties, with Jackson's move.
Sophomore
>
> Marcus Tubbs started several games at tackle last season and will be a
> starter against New Mexico State. Sophomore Adam Doiron and redshirt
> freshman
> Stevie Lee are battling for the other tackle spot. Senior Maurice Gordon
> will
> start against passing teams.
> At the safety spots, the coaches are alternating senior Ahmad Brooks and
> sophomores Nathan Vasher and Dakarai Pearson.
> It looks like freshman walk-on Dusty Mangum has won the place-kicking
job.
> He
> has been very accurate up to 45 yards. JC transfer Brian Bradley is the
> punter and walk-on TE Cullen Loeffler has been doing a fine job aof deep
> snapping.. Ike and Williams will be the primary kickoff returners and
> Vasher
> is the top punt returner.

> RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns have stepped up their recruiting of WR
> Biren
> Ealy, 6-4, 195, 4.48, of Cypress Falls. He has great leaping ability to
go
>
> with his tall frame. . . They also have made a lot of headway with Ath
> DaBryan Blanton of Forney, who might be the nation's fastest football
> player
> after that smoking 20.37 fully automatic clocking in breaking the state
> 200-meter record at the state track meet. He's a high school RB, but at
> 5-11,
> 165, will be a WR or DB in college. He has great hands to go with that
