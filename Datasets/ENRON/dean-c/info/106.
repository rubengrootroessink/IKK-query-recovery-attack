changed.
Here's the full schedule of practices that will be open to the public:
Monday, August 6 - Freshmen report
Tuesday, August 7 - Freshmen practices 10:30 a.m. & 5 p.m.
Wednesday, August 8 - Freshmen practices 9:15 a.m. & 5 p.m.
Thursday, August 9 - Varsity reports, no practice
Saturday, August 11 - First full-team practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.

Friday, August 17 - Practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.

Stadium
Thursday, August 23 - Practice 3 p.m.
All practices will be at Frank Denius Field at 26th & Red River and all
scrimmages will be at the stadium.
As I reported earlier, Brown is having more early morning and late evening
practices when the team practices twice daily, and is having only one
practice on days the team works during the hottest part of the day.
He said he is trying the new approach in an effort to avoid some of the
early-season problems that have led to upset losses the last two years to
North Carolina State and Stanford.
He said players need to be shape, but they also need to avoid having tired
legs when the season starts.

True Orange Observations

Texas' specific problems on offense, defense and special teams were addressed
in the lead story, but I think there are two general areas, one on offense
and one on defense, where improvement must be made for the team to finish in
the top 10 for the first time since 1983.
Offensively, the Longhorns were a feast-or-famine team in all the big games
last year and even in some of the ones that wound up being laughers.
I am referring to their problem with three-down possessions. In the rout of
the Aggies, for example, Texas had one first down in the entire first half
before exploding for four touchdowns in the third quarter. That's a bunch of
three-and-outs.
In the Oklahoma debacle, Texas made one first down while the Sooners were
scoring six touchdowns to put the game on ice early.
In the bowl loss to Oregon, Texas fell behind 14-0 in the first quarter, had
two long, back-to-back scoring drives to start the second quarter, but  had
minus yardage on its other second-quarter possession and then had only two
first downs in the entire third quarter when the Ducks came from behind to
start taking control.
I could cite more examples, but you saw the games and you know the team had a
problem with too many three-down possessions in a row in the losses and in
some of the victories.
Three-down possessions also hurt the defense because the defenders wind up
being on the field too long with little opportunity to rest.
One seldom mentioned reason Josh Heupel was such an effective quarterback for
OU was that he almost always moved the team for a first down or two, even on
drives that fizzled out. That kept his defense fresh and gave it a long field
to defend.
The Longhorn defenders, conversely, frequently had to defend very short
fields.
Let's hope the team is better at consistently moving the ball this year.
Defensively, the Longhorns ran man-for-man defenses a lot more than zones.
I know a couple of pro coaches who tell me the most effective pass defense is
one that keeps the opponents guessing about the coverage.
The hiring of Duane Akina as secondary coach, coupled with Mack Brown's
stated desire to mix up the pass coverage, should help in that area.
Another problem with man-for-man is that teams like OU frequently have a
pickoff man to block a cornerback and that can leave the cornerback's guy
wide open.
Still another negative against using all man-for-man is that zones are
usually more effective on long yardage plays because the zone can be used to
keep the defenders from getting deep quickly.
That was one reason the Longhorn defense gave up so many third-and-long plays
last season.
Let's hope that improves this year, too, and a more diversified coverage
would help a lot.

Four UT Games Already on TV

The Longhorns first three games and the regular-season finale at Texas A&M
will be televised.
The most recent one to be announced is the Sept. 22 game at Houston. ESPN2
had picked it for an 8 p.m. national telecast.
That is very good news because the game will be played in Robertson Stadium,
which seats only slightly more than 30,000.
The Sept. 1 opener against New Mexico State will have a 6 p.m. kickoff and
will be televised nationally by the Fox Network.
The Sept. 8 game against North Carolina also will be televised. That's the 
good news. The bad news is that it is set for an 11 a.m. kickoff. ABC will
televise the game regionally.
Let's hope it's a cloudy day, because the sun will keep the stadium very hot
unless some cloud cover is available.
If Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and his party gave up their plush box and
sat out in the stands with the regular folks for the Carolina game, I don't
think we would have many mid-day kickoffs in September in the future.
The A&M game on Nov. 23 in College Station, will be televised nationally by
ABC at 11 a.m., too, but that won't pose a heat problem in late November.
It will pose a problem on where the Longhorn teams stays the night before the
game because I don't think Mack Brown will try College Station again after
the problems last time around.
The Aggies won't have that problem in 2002 when they come to Austin for an 11
a.m. game because visiting teams can count on Austin hotels to protect them
from harassment like annoying phone calls all night, no pre-game meal and all
the other little annoying things that happend to the Horns in College Station
last year.
ABC has worked out a deal with the Big 12 to televise the Texas-Texas A&M and
Nebraska-Colorado games for the next four years, with Texas and A&M getting
the 11 a.m. kickoffs and Nebraska and Colorado getting the 2:30 p.m. kickoffs
for the first two years, then switching times for the next two years.
Times for the remaining seven regular season games will be set later, and
most starting times won't be known until the television networks exercise
their options 12 days before each game.
Here's the complete schedule:
Sept. 1 New Mexico State, 6 p.m., Fox national TV
Sept. 8 North Carolina, 11 a.m., ABC regional TV
Sept. 22 at Houston, 8 p.m., ESPN2 national TV
Sept. 29 Texas Tech
Oct. 6 vs. Oklahoma at Dallas
Oct. 13 at Oklahoma State
Oct. 20 Colorado
Oct. 27 at Missouri
Nov. 3 at Baylor
Nov. 10 Kansas
Nov. 23 at Texas A&M, 11 a.m., ABC national TV

Horns Get Dutch Basketball Star
Sydmill Harris, a  6-6, 190-pound shooting guard for The Netherlands National
Team, has enrolled as a freshman at Texas and is eligible to play for the UT
basketball team this year.
Harris averaged 7.5 points in his first season with the national team after
leading the Dutch Junior National Team in scoring for four  seasons.
Longhorn players who have been working out with Harris report he lives up to
his reputation as a super shooter with outstanding range.
Two top juniors who are being nationally recruited, also are strongly
considering Texas. They are Brad Buckman, a 6-8, 230-pound forward from
Austin Westlake, and Rashad Anderson, a 6-5 shooting guard from Lakeland,
Florida.
Buckman and Anderson have shot to the forefront of the top national juniors
with outstanding play in AAU ball this summer. Buckman averaged 20 points and
10 rebounds last season and Anderson averaged 24 points a game..
T. J. Ford, the great point guard prospect who is a freshman at Texas this
year, has been diagnosed with a chronic spinal condition stemming from
abnormal openings in the spinal column that the spinal cord runs through.
Originally, surgery was planned to correct it, but team doctors and Ford and
his family decided not to have surgery at this time. He has played and
starred with the condition for several years.
He has resumed working out.

(I might have put the two shorties below in one of the earlier parts. If so,
I apologize)

Stephens Makes National Team

UT sophomore Stacy Stephens was one of 12 top players aged 19-and-younger who
made the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was one of the team's top rebounders and got
10 boards in the final game in the Junior World Championships in the Czech
Republic to help the USA team win the bronze medal with a 6-1 record.

Slugger Commits to UT

Brent Clevlen, 6-1, 185, 4.5, of Round Rock Westwood, one of the state's top
junior baseball hitters, has committed to play for Texas.
Clevlen, who also is a fine quarterback in football, hit  .455 and blasted 11
home runs last season after hitting .515 as a sophomore.
He also had offers from several other top baseball schools, including Baylor,
Rice, Texas A&M, Houston and Tulane.
