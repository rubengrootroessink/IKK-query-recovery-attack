 DT Lyle Sendlein Commits to Longhorns

 Lyle Sendlein says he has known since he was a small child that he wanted
 to
 play football at Texas, so he said a new NCAA rule interpretation that
 prohibits recruits committing while at a summer camp was no problem at
 all.
 "The mini-camp was today (Sunday), so I just called them Saturday and
 committed," he said. "When they told me about the new rule, I just decided
 to
 take care of it in advance. I knew I was going to play for the Longhorns,
 so
 I didn't have any problem committing before I got here for the camp."
 Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus
 Notre
 Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
 Coach Mack Brown said one of the Longhorns' top recruiting goals this year

 was to sign several top defensive linemen, and, while he can't comment on
 individual recruits,  Sendlein is an outstanding defensive line prospect.
 Sendlein said he was measured at the camp and came in at a shade over 6-4,

 and he said he weighed in at 263. He also said he clocked a 5.0 in the 40,

 "but it seemed like the times were all a little slow. I usually run 4.8 or

 4.9." He is quick enough that he plays middle linebacker for Scottsdale
 Chaparral, the Arizona big school state champion two years running after
 going 14-0 in 1999 and 2000.
 Sendlein brings to four the number of early commitments. DT Sonny Davis,
 who
 committed to Texas right out of Austin Lanier, is in junior college in
 Mississippi and says he still plans to come to Texas when he graduates
 from
 the JC. That would put him on schedule to come in with next February's
 signees.
 OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, two of
 the
 state's top prospects, also have committed to Texas. The Longhorns plan to

 sign only three offensive linemen and Valdez was the first one they
 offered.
 They hope to get the other two from a threesome that includes Jeff Lebby
 of
 Andrews, Tony Ugoh of Houston Westfield and Justin Blaylock of Plano East.

 Lebby and Blaylock attended Sunday's UT mini-camp.
 Anderson is No. 3 and Valdez is No. 23 on my 25-man "difference-maker"
 list.
 Davis was in my top five his senior year and Sendlein would be in my top
 10
 this year if he played in Texas. In other words, this is a great quartet
 to
 start the UT recruiting bandwagon rolling.
 DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands
 and
 WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest, the top players in the state at their
 respective positions, also attended the UT mini-camp Sunday. I talked to
 all
 of them tonight and they all  like Texas, but they also are considering
 several other schools and all three  said they probably will not commit to

 anyone this summer. I like the Longhorns chances with both Wrights, but I
 think Leitko is so wide open that he could wind up at any of the five
 schools
 he is considering (UT, A&M, Stanford, Michigan and Notre Dame).
 Texas A&M also had a mini-camp Sunday and Aggie reporters were saying no
 one
 at the camp was likely to get an offer at this point, so it would appear
 that
 the cream of the state's recruiting crop showed up in Austin. I know
 Leitko,
 Lebby, Blaylock, and both Wrights had offers from Texas before they came
 to
 the camp Sunday.

 The NCAA edict that prevents recruits from accepting scholarships while at
 a
 summer camp is strange because there are no new rules relating to camps.
 It
 seems that some NCAA bureaucrat just gave a new interpretation based on a
 rule that that has been around for several years.

 FOOTBALL NOTES: Lindy's, the first reputable national college football
 magazine I have seen this year, picks Chris Simms as the third best QB in
 the
 country and the best one in the Big 12. If he lives up to that hype, I
 think
 we can all buy our plane tickets to Pasadena. With the receivers the
 Longhorns have in stock, a great quarterback would make the Texas offense
 too
 tough to handle by anyone on the schedule. To reach that level, Simms will

 need to be much improved  at looking off his receivers and much better at
 throwing the ball away at times instead of forcing it into double
 coverage. .
 . Super RB recruit Cedric Benson of Midland Lee is already in Austin
 working
 out and getting ready for the season.
