All Freshmen Report on Time; Colorado Impresses Nordgren

The 19 scholarship freshmen all reported on time Sunday, and coach Mack
Brown
made a slight change in the time for Monday's first freshman football
practice. The freshmen will practice at  11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday and 9
a.m.
and 5 p.m. on Tuesday at Frank Denius Fields at 26th and Red River. I'll
publish official heights and weights on the freshmen when UT weighs and
measures them in the next few days.
The reason only 19 freshmen reported Monday was that DT Stevie Lee and DB
Phillip Geiggar both enrolled in January and went through spring training,
and DTs Sonny Davis and Marcel Moses failed to qualify academically and are
going to junior colleges.
Two walk-ons also showed up with the freshmen. To show up early, walk-ons
have to receive invitations because most walk-ons don't start practicing
until school starts. The walk-ons, both defensive backs, are Chad Davis,
5-10, 180, 4.5, of Dallas Skyline, and Justin McMinn, 6-0, 180, 4.5, of
Waco
Midway. McMinn was a first-team Class 4A All-State performer last season.
Brown said Nathan Vasher of Texarkana wants to play in the defensive
backfield and Tony Jeffery of Houston Klein Forest wants to play wide
receiver, and he said both will get their wishes.
Brown said Roy Williams of Odessa Permian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand
Prairie, Sloan Thomas of Klein and Jeffery will all be wide receivers and
he
said all four will be given hurry-up instructions to try to get them ready
to
play early because the Longhorns have no returning regulars at wide
receiver.
Vasher, an exceptional athlete who was a rare two-way first-time All-State
performer last year, could work his way into the Longhorns' dime package
(six
defensive backs) during the season because he has the speed (10.48 100
meters) to go along with good height at about 5-10 or 5-11, that the
coaches
like in their cornerbacks.
Brown said bump-and-run coverage is something the receivers and cornerbacks
will have to work on to earn playing time. "If a wide receiver can't
separate
from the defensive back, he's not going to play," Brown said.
He told me earlier this year that the thing that makes Florida State so
good
every year "is they can play bump  and run (on defense) and they can beat
bump and run (on offense)." He said the wide receivers the Longhorns
recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bump-and-run
coverage.

Several people have asked about the status of C Marcel Blanchard. He
received
a medical hardship scholarship because of chronic shoulder problem and is
no
longer playing football.

The Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Buffaloes made a big impression on the
state's top QB prospect Friday and Saturday., Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217,
4.62,
of Dallas Bishop Lynch, flew to Colorado Friday with his father and came
home
late Saturday.
He had told me he probably would commit to Texas right after he returned
from
Colorado, but now he says he wants to wait and take a few official visits
and
probably won't announce his choice until mid-October.
"Boulder is really a beautiful city," he said. "The coaches at Colorado are
really impressive. They have the program on the right track and they are
enlarging their stadium"
He said Colorado and Texas are at the top of his list, and said he also has
offers from Purdue, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M, Tennessee, Iowa, Houston,
Missouri and several other schools.
This is not a good development for the Horns. When a recruit goes from
being
ready to commit to having a new big two after visiting a second school, it
is
not a good sign. I see it as about a 50-50 proposition now.
* * * *
The Longhorns are out front with two outstanding defensive ends from other
states, and they are in contention for still a third out-of-state defensive
end. The two who list the Horns No. 1 are Eric Hall, 6-3, 230, 4.5, from
Clarksville, Tennessee,  and Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 255, 4.75, from Valencia,
California. Hall was born in Texas (Fort Hood) and Jakes lived in Plano for
about five years. Both are outstanding prospects who are drawing offers
from
other top schools. The one who is considering Texas is Shaun Cody, 6-5,
250,
4.7, of Los Altos HS in Hacienda Heights, California. He had an incredible
33
sacks last year. He says he plans to visit Texas.
* * * *
Texas has 12 early commitments  including seven offensive linemen. They are
Terrance Young of Longview,  Mike Garcia of Galena Park,  Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of
Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
