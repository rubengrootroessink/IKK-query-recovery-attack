> Texas assistant coach Tim Brewster did a great recruiting job with
> Johnson,
> who listed Texas No. 1 throughout the recruiting process.
> Johnson said he chose Texas because "I love their offense. They really

is
>

> The other eight recruits who have been listed on top national teams are

> RECRUITING NOTES: Super QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 200, 4.4, of Houston
> Madison
> says his top two teams right now are Texas and Miami. Young is one of the

> nation's top quarterback prospects. He also is an outstanding basketball
> player, but wants to concentrate on football in college. . . The
> Texas-Oklahoma game Saturday will be a big factor in deciding where
> several
> top recruits go, including OL Justin Blolock of Plano East, DE Larry
> Dibbles
> of Lancaster, LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and DE Bryan Pickryl of
> Jenks, Oklahoma. All of them are national top 100 recruits.

> FOOTBALL NOTES: UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese is an advocate of
> in-your-face man-for-man pass defense and all-out blitzing to put
pressure
> on
> the quarterback, but he changed his tactics against Texas Tech's passing
> circus, playing about 95% zone defense and usually rushing only two or
> three
> linemen. Look for similar tactics against Oklahoma Saturday. But Reese
> said
> it won't be so similar that the Sooners can figure on seeing the same
> things
> the Horns used with such success Saturday night. "You have to keep them
> guessing," he said. "These spread offenses are making us all do things we

> never thought we'd do."

> BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Stephanie Thiel, a 5-9 combo guard at
> two-time
> defending Class A champion Nazarethe, has committed to Texas. She was the

> State Tournament Class A MVP as a junior in leading Nazareth to the state

> title. She averaged 21.2 points a game, and, like all Nazareth players,
is
>
> strong defensively and is an excellent ball handler and passer. . .  Brad

> Buckman, the 6-8 power forward from Austin Westlake who is ranked as one
> of
> the nation's top 50 basketball prospects, took his official visit to
Texas
>
> over the weekend and has narrowed his choices to Texas and North
Carolina.
> He
> visited North Carolina earlier and also visited Kansas, but he has
> eliminated
