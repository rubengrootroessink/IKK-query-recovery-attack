CB Griffin Becomes Horns' 11th Commitment; Nordgren Getting Close

CB Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, of San Antonio Holmes has become the
11th
commitment in the Longhorns' drive toward another nationally ranked
recruiting class.
Griffin is one of the state's top cornerbacks and said the Longhorn coaches
"told me I was the kind of tall, fast cornerback they are looking for." He
is
tall for a cornerback, and he is fast, too, having run a 10.5 100 meters
during the last track season.
He had 41 tackles last season, broke up 14 passes and intercepted three
passes, returning two of them for touchdowns. His coach at Holmes, David
Sanchez, said Griffin "is the best cover corner in the district."
Holmes went 13-2 last season, and Sanchez said Griffin is so talented that
he
will play him at wide receiver at times this season.
Griffin said he also had offers from Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Colorado and
Arkansas, "but I really like Texas' style of play and I knew all along
that's
where I wanted to go."
Griffin said he and his mother will come back to Austin on Aug. 2 to meet
with head coach Mack Brown to make the commitment official. "I've never met
coach Brown in person and he was on vacation," Griffin said, "but coach
(Tim)
Nunez told me coach Brown wants me and that he likes to meet with everyone
to
make it official."
"I'm committed to Texas and Texas is committed to me," Griffin said. "Texas
is where I wanted to go and I am looking forward to playing football and
getting my education at Texas."
Griffin and his mother had visited UT unofficially Tuesday. Griffin said he
met with Nunez, who recruits the San Antonio area, and defensive
coordinator
Carl Reese.
The state's top QB, Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, told me he is
close
to committing to Texas. He and his parents met Monday with UT offensive
coordinator Greg Davis and assistant coach Bruce Chambers, who recruits the
Dallas area, and Nordgren said, "I had a great time. I love Texas and it
would take something really major to cause me to go anywhere else."
Nordgren said he really likes the Texas offense, loves Austin "and my folks
own a ranch near Blanco, so they could see me play if I come to Texas." He
said he probably will announce his college intentions in about 10 days. "I
am
going to take an unofficial visit to A&M and I'm going to go to a camp at
LSU, and then I think I'll be ready. I love everything about Texas, but I
just have to really make sure because I'm going to be spending the next
five
years of my life at the school I pick."
The Longhorns now have 11 early commitments, including six offensive
linemen.
The OLs are Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas),
Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village,
Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio
Randall of Blinn JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other four commitments are QB/DB
Kendal Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs
Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
I have seen some more tape on Lebron and the gurus, including me, simply
missed on him. I'm glad the Texas coaches do a better job because he's big,
quick and he hits hard. He's also very good in pass coverage.

So far, five members of the first team of Dave Campbell's Texas Football
magazine's Super Team have committed to colleges. Running back David
Underwood of Madisonville committed to Michigan and the other four

- Briles,
Robinson, Scott and Griffin
- commited to UT.

FOOTBALL NOTES: There are a lot of rumors that super WR recruit Roy
Williams
has reinjured the shoulder the hurt in the Texas-California All-Star game.
I
talked to his mother at 6 p.m. today (Thursday) and she told me she had
talked to Roy about an hour before I called "and he's doing fine. The
shoulder is still a little sore, but he said it's getting better all the
time." She said Williams will come back to Odessa in about two weeks to get
some more treatment on the shoulder. Because he has not enrolled at UT yet,
Texas cannot pick up his medical expenses. . . With football season more
than
a month away, Longhorn ticket sales have already matched their all-time
sing-season high of 48,000. The record was set last year and it will be
broken Friday. The previous record was 39,743 back in 1977.
