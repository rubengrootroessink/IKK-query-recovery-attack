Tyrone Richardson Only Horn Missing After Reporting Date

The Texas veterans, 58 scholarship players strong, checked in on time
Wednesday, with freshman RB Tyrone Richardson the only absentee.
Richardson,
who enrolled in January and went through spring practice, said, "I have
some
academic issues I need to take care of to return to the team." He said he
hopes to be back in January.
Coach Mack Brown said he is excited about the heralded freshman class and
about the returning players. "I am really looking forward to meshing the
two
groups together," he said. "This is a very exciting time for everyone
involved with Texas football."
Brown said the Longhorns don't deserve their No. 7 national ranking heading
into the season, but he said the team has a chance to improve enough to
deserve the high ranking later this year.
He has cited the loss of all the starters at wide receiver and defensive
end
as two of the main reasons he thinks the team doesn't deserve a top-10
ranking right now. That talented freshmen class includes the best three
wide
receivers I've seen in Texas (Roy Willliams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas)
in the 10 years I've been doing this, plus another outstanding prospect who
is a former quarterback (Tony Jeffery). It also includes Adam Doiron and
Kalen Thornton, two big, quick defensive ends who have a lot of potential.
Brown said it is rare for true freshmen to be play a major role on a good
team before mid-season, but some of the veteran defensive backs who came
out
to watch the freshman receivers Tuesday afternoon said they don't think it
will take Williams, Johnson, Thomas and Jeffery that long.
Starting free safety Greg Brown said, "They are really good players. They
are
big and they have great speed. I think they have a chance to help us a
lot."
Starting cornerback Rod Babers, never one to shy away from a challenge,
said
he plans to welcome the rookies by showing them a big-time hit at the line
of
scrimmage, but he, too, said he was impressed. "They are really fast and
they
all catch the ball pretty good," he said. "They have good height, too."
Until the youngsters start knocking heads with the varsity, nothing is
certain, but the early betting would be on at least two of the young wide
receivers to play major roles on the 2000 Longhorn team.

Some of you have asked me to break down the current list of commitments and
the prospects for adding more commitments on a position-by-position basis.
It's a little to early to do any guessing about future commitments at wide
receiver and defensive back because the coaches probably will wait to see a
few high school games before deciding which WRs and DBs to go after. But
here's the way it looks to me at the other spots (national top 100 players
are underlined):
QB - (no commitment) Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of
Shreveport Evangel, the highest rated QBs in their respective states, are
the
two main prospects. UT should get one of them.
RB - (no commitment) Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and Anthony Johnson of
Jefferson are the two most likely future Longhorns, but Jabari Davis of
Tucker, Ga., and Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky., are two superstars who say
they plan to visit UT. James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., is the only
fullback
UT is recruiting.
TE - (no commitment)  James Moses of Galena Park North Shore is the only
tight end on the UT horizon.
OL - (7 commitments) Texas has commitments from Jonathan Scott of Dallas
Carter, Abe Robinson of Jersey Village, Matt Garcia of Galena Park, Will
Allen of Cypress Falls, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Terrance Young of
Longview and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC. The Longhorns will sign one or two
more, if they can get Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville, William Winston of
Houston Madison or Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill.
DE - (no commitments) The coaches want to sign about five defensive linemen
and at least three of them probably will be ends. The ones UT has the best
shots at are Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., Kaelen Jakes of Valencia,
Cal.,
and Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson. Shaun Cody of Los Altos HS in
Hacienda Heights, Cal., who had an incredible 33 sacks last year, also says
he will visit Texas.
DT - (no commitments) Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Paul Broussard
of
Blinn JC are the main hopes.
LB - (1 commitment) Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison is the only middle
backer
UT will take. Derrick Johnson of Waco, Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park
North
Shore and Lance McFarland of Jefferson are other possibilities. Jackson and
McFarland also have big frames and could wind up at defensive end.
