True Orange, Part 2

Recruiting Roundup

RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter are =
UT
commitments who are on USA-Today's Top 25 national players.
Two other UT pledges =01) OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QB-Athlete
Kendal Briles of Frenship =01) are on some national top 100 lists.
Benson, running behind an all-new offensive line, is still racking up
impressive numbers. He had 14 carries for 140 yards and a TD, plus a 38-yar=
d
reception, in the defending state champions' 40-12 victory over a good
Victoria team in the season opener, then scored four touchdowns on just nin=
e
carries, good for 142 yards, in a 40-7 romp past Longview.
His four TDs came on runs of 19, 4, 85 and 4 yards. For the year, he has 23=
,
carries, 282 yards and five touchdowns. Behind an inexperienced OL, he is
averaging 12.3 yards per carry and a touchdown every 4.6 carries.
Terrance Young, the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT, said it
was a long way to go for a high school football game, but he said it was
worth it just to see Benson run.
"I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome," You=
ng
said. " Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun. He is an awesome
player."
Benson won't have the monster year he had last year, at his present pace,
simply because he isn't carrying the ball as much.
Lee coach John Parchman, trying for a third consecutive state title, is
working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little
more. When you lose as many seniors as he did, you have to improvise.
Briles, the Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill=
e
to the state title in 1999, is at a new 4A school, Wolfforth Frenship near
Lubbock, because his dad, former Stephenville coach Art Briles, is on the
coaching staff at Texas Tech.
But don't worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted. Frenship open=
ed
its season Friday and Briles passed for 279 yards and four touchdowns and r=
an
for 105 more yards and two more tallies in a 47-20 conquest of Canyon, an
11-3 playoff team last year.
I went to Houston to scout some players last weekend. Galena Park North Sho=
re
beat Alief Hastings Friday night in Galena Park, where it actually rained.
It's been so dry in Austin lately that I enjoyed getting wet.
North Shore TE James Moses and DE/LB Jonathan Jackson both looked good, but=
 a
guy who really caught my eye was Hastings' DT Rodrique Wright, a junior who
is listed in the program as 6-5, 324. If he is No. 61, as the program state=
s,
he looks about 6-4, 270, but he is a fine player. He stuffs the run, and he
has great quickness to chase  the passer. Look for him to be a big-time
recruit next year.
Aldine played Madison in a battle of Class 5A Houston powers. Aldine won, b=
ut
the most impressive players in the game were Madison OL William Winston and
his team's junior QB, Vincent Young.
Winston has the quickest feet of any 330-pounder I've seen this year.
Aldine's Lawrence Hooper is a highly recruited DE. Some people think he's t=
he
best one in the state, but Winston definitely won their individual battle. =
At
6-6, 330, he is big enough to overpower most opponents, and he is incredibl=
y
quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers. He is still considering Texa=
s,
A&M and a lot of other people, and he is a prize.
Young is 6-5, 190, and he runs a sub-4.5 40. He has a powerful arm, but
Aldine is a ground-oriented team and he is outstanding on the option. He wi=
ll
be one of the state's top 10 recruits next year.
Selvin Young, the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the
2,200-yard rushing mark as a sophomore, is still bothered by the badly
sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season, and he saw only limit=
ed
action in his team's opener.
* * * *
Eric Hall, the fine defensive end from Clarksville, Tenn., took his officia=
l
visit to Texas last weekend, and his mother said he had a great time.
He didn't get home in time for me to talk to him before going to press, but
he told me before he came that Texas was his No. 1 choice, and his mother
said he told her the visit went even better than he expected.
Other high school stars who came to the game Saturday included three of the
state's top 10 players =01) DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellis, OL Jami High=
tower
of Jacksonville and S Dewayne Brandon of Temple.
Harris said he had a great time at UT. "It was great seeing all those peopl=
e
in the stands," he said. "I can really see myself as a Longhorn. I couldn't
believe some of the plays Roy Williams made. They tell you that you can pla=
y
as a freshman if you're good enough, and he proved that's true."
But he said he wants to take some official visits before making committing =
to
anyone.
Brandon also said Texas is his top choice.
Hightower says it's a three-team race between Texas, A&M and Nebraska "and
nobody is out front. I want to take official visits to all three of them
before making up my mind."
Killeen Ellison MLB Yamil Lebron and San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin,
two other UT commitments, also were at the game.
* * * *
The Horns have 13 total commitments. They haven't added anyone since my
August issue.

Out-of-State Prospects

Texas is recruiting several out-of-state players. Here are the ones who are
seriously considering UT:
Quarterback
Bret Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (LSU, UT, FSU, Tenn)
Running Back
Jabari Davis, 5-11, 224, 4.5, Tucker, Ga. (Tenn, Ga, UT, Neb, Ala)
Eric Shelton, 6-3, 230, 4.45, Lexington, Ky., Bryan Station (Ky, FSU, Fla,

ND)
Defensive Tackle

UT)

Recruiting: Proof Is in the Pudding

I've been covering recruiting since 1990, and there definitely is a
correlation between recruiting success and success on the field.
But Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th=
an
that, and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to 1983, the year befo=
re
the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of
being hammered, and compiled the results.
The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year, so it =
is
able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own
list of top recruits. That should give it a great degree of accuracy.
Here is what the study showed:

DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference, plus results of UT-A&=

**00: Texas #1, A&M #2
** Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin, according to Dave
Campbell's rating system.

A&M put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early 1980's,
and kept it going, with the exception of 1989, until Texas started having
good recruiting success again in 1993.
It's no coincidence that the Aggies, who had never  won more than three in =
a=20
row against the Longhorns (and that was way back in 1909-10-11), won five i=
n
a row and nine times in 10 years during their recruiting dominance over the
Longhorns.
Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams, and that is w=
hy
the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun.
But look at those recent classes. All the strange happenings at A&M last
season delayed the inevitable, in my opinion, and, if those recruiting
rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the
last two decades, the Longhorns' supremacy in recruiting should make this
first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series, whi=
ch
the Horns already lead, 67-34-5.

Four Baseball Stars Commit

The Longhorn  baseball coaches already have commitments from four top
baseball players.
They are catcher Jack Sweeney, 6-2, 200, of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and
three hard-throwing right-handed pitchers =01)  Joey Guajardo, 6-0, 190, wh=
o
threw three no-hitters as a junior at Round Rock, and  Austin Westlake aces
Chaz Taylor, 6-3, 180, and, Huston Street, 5-11, 180.
Street, who was 6-1 with a 1.27 ERA last season,  is the son of former UT
football and baseball star James Street.
Taylor pitched a two-hitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs, a
powerful team that included seven college players or signees, including Jas=
on
Stokes of Coppell. He struck Stokes out twice in that game. Stokes, a UT
signee, signed a $2 million pro contract last week.
Sweeney started 10 games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter
ever since. He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields=
 a
powerful bat.

Basketball Recruiting

The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting
weekend for both Texas basketball teams.
T. J. Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class
5A State Championship last season, took his official visit to UT.
He said he enjoyed the trip. "I really like the coaches and the players and
there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin," he said.
He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston
before making a decision.
Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country.
The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits. They a=
re
6-2 forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary, Canada, and 5-11 guard
Lauren Selmon of Norman, Okla. Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro
football star Dewey Selmon.

Football Videos Available

Host Communications is offering its season video package against this year.
You can get a video each week with the complete UT football game on it, plu=
s
some of coach Mack Brown's pre-game, half-time and post-game comments to th=
e
team and media, and the Longhorn radio team's play-by-play when you sign up=
.
It's $250 for the 11-game package, and, if UT makes the Big 12 championship
game, that one is included, too.
To order the package, you can call 512-478-1833 and ask for Extension 10.
I get this package and it's a great way to watch each game because all the
huddles and the time between plays are eliminated. I can watch the entire
game, with coach Brown's comments, in less than an hour.

UT Women Set Schedule

The Longhorn women's basketball schedule features 27 regular season games,
highlighted by UT's hosting of the elite Four in the Fall doubleheader
basketball tournament (Saturday, Dec. 9) which will  be televised nationall=

Chris Plonsky, an associate athletic director at Texas, told me last week t=
he
Big 12 Conference is directing all member universities to notify publishers
of independent publications, such as True Orange, that they can no longer
advertise for "school boosters" to buy high school subscriptions.
Plonsky told me the conference will penalize the UT Athletic Department if =
I
continue to publicly urge you to buy library subscriptions.
I'm not sure the conference could make that stick if anybody wanted to put =
it
to the legal test, but she told me all the other school publications in the
conference are dropping their public solicitations for schools, too.
I won't be publicizing my school subscriptions in the future. However, thos=
e
of you who do send True Orange to one or more school libraries can keep doi=
ng
so in the future if you so desire. I just won't be able to ask you to that =
on
the pages of this newsletter.
Thanks for your great support in getting University of Texas news out to al=
l
the high schools, and I regret that I have to stop soliciting new
subscriptions.
Having great football teams helps all universities grow, and your support h=
as
helped get the word about the Longhorns into 160 high schools in Texas and
several states.
