Scouting Colorado

Colorado, playing the toughest schedule in the country, was winless in four
games before storming into College Station and ending the Aggies' 22-game
home winning streak, 26-19, last week.
And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to
mile-high Boulder for a 2:30 p.m. game Saturday. It will not be televised.
"That sure got my attention," said Texas coach Mack Brown. "College Station
is a tough place for the visiting team."
Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week. The
Buffaloes opened the season with a 28-24 loss to Colorado State, then fell =
to
Southern Cal, 17-14. Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed, also
by a 17-14 score. Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for =
a
44-21 victory.
After the K-State loss, Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off
his players' helmets if they didn't start playing better.
Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs  all the way against A&M, and
he came through big, hitting 15 of 25 passes for 239 yards and one touchdow=
n
and running 18 yards for another touchdown.
Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury, but Cortlen
Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for 99 yards and a touchdown Saturda=
y.
WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel
Graham also is a threat.
Defensively, the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters,
headed by Jashon Sykes.
The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that
went 7-5 last year in Barnett's first season at the helm.
For the Longhorns to win, the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a
one-time disaster and go back to playing smash-mouth defense. It also has t=
o
pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes.
Offensively, the Horns have to come out with their best shots early. They
haven't scored an offensive TD all year and haven't moved the ball at all i=
n
some of their first quarters this season. Unless the offense plays better
than it has been playing, it will be tough to win this game.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

Oklahoma travels to Manhattan Saturday to play Kansas State in a battle of
top 10 undefeated powers.
Texas also visits Colorado in a game that will have a major bearing on the
races in both divisions because both teams already have one league loss.
Oklahoma is the only team in the Southern Division without a league loss,
while Kansas State and Nebraska are the unbeaten teams in the North.

Recruiting Roundup

Texas still has 16 commitments and the Longhorns plan to sign 22 to 25
players, with several of the remaining spots going to defensive linemen.
Tommie Harris, the great DT from Killeen Ellison, is the No. 1 guy on UT's
wish list, with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., the only
other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns.
This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle, so Harris and Jakes are =
as
important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns' wish list.
Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
As you can see, the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive
linemen, running backs, linebackers and defensive backs.
They want to sign one QB, one TE, one or two WRs, Waco's great LB Derrick
Johnson (who had 30 tackles in his team's loss to power Tyler John Tyler
about 10 days ago) super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre=
at
prospect who wants to come.
They should be able to get a QB and TE, and they might get one WR, but
probably won't be able to get two.
They lead for both Johnson and Brandon.
If things fall like they appear to be developing, there will be at least fo=
ur
spots left for defensive linemen, and possibly more, depending on whether t=
he
coaches will sign 25 players.
But right now, it doesn't look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top
defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns' way
are Jakes, DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., DE Kevin Everett of Port
Arthur Jefferson (who might be better suited to playing TE).
Harris appears to be wide open.
If the Horns don't fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting
season, they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro=
up
of the big guys who are juniors this year.
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas
practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head
coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis, but he said he isn't
ready to commit and wants to look around some more . . . The other QB Texas
is recruiting, Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, visits Florida State this
weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week. He also
has visited Texas and Purdue, and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base=
d
on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the
Boilermakers. . . LB/DE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein=
g
recruited by most colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are
wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 =
at
a summer camp. That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder.

Olympic Gold

Current and former University of Texas  student-athletes and coaches
accounted for 22 medals at the 2000  Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia which concluded on Sunday,  Oct. 1.
Longhorns captured 18 medals - seven gold, nine silver and two bronze - whi=
le
Longhorn coaches worked with teams that won four gold medals.
The 18 medals earned by the UT competitors tied Texas for first with UCLA
nationally for most medals won by current/former student-athletes among all
NCAA institutions.
Former Longhorn basketball star Nell Fortner (1981), coached the gold-meal
winning  U.S. Olympic Women's Basketball Team,  while current Longhorn men'=

UT Women Get 2 More Stars

College basketball coaches love always try to recruit players with height,
quickness, ball-handling ability and a good shooting eye.
The trouble is that few players have all of those abilities.
But coach Jody Conradt, who already had two outstanding recruits with all
four of those traits, landed two more last week for the Texas women's
basketball team.
Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada, two 6-2 stars who are so versatile that they have
played point guard at times, are the latest additions to Conradt's recruiti=
ng
class.
Bowers is a national top 25 player who was one of just four high school
underclassmen to be invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team
She also considered Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She
averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds last season.
Her high school is 53-2 for the last two seasons, winning one Oklahoma stat=
e
title and finishing as the runner-up to the state champion the other season=
.
"Last year, our point guard got hurt, so Kala played point guard for us,"
Woodward coach Kim Kramer said. "She's so versatile she can play any
position."
Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for Chestermere High School in
Calgary. She was a member of the Canadian junior national team.
She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up  picking Texas over
Arizona State.
Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell "is a 6-2 player who can handle the
ball like a guard, run the floor and shoot the three. She's an inside/outsi=
de
player with skills you normally don't see in a girl her size."
"She has great all-around skills," he said. "Texas got an outstanding playe=
r.
She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt=
.
She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere
else."
Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of
Windthorst, the state's hottest prospect, and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of
Houston Jersey Village.
Like Bowers and Bell, they  are fine ball handlers and shooters.
Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top 25 list. Schrieb=
er
has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea=
dy
has been the state tourney MVP three times, with her senior season still
remaining.

Support UT

Do you love UT athletics? Are you one of the thousands of loyal fans tho tu=
rn
out for football, baseball and/or basketball games?
If you are, then you need to join the Ex-Students' Association.  If you hav=
e
already joined, recruit a  Longhorn friend and get him or her to join.
There has never been a better time to join because this is the year the
Ex-Students Association is sponsoring a membership campaign to better serve
the university in many ways, including expansion of the scholarship program
that already funnels nearly $2 million annually to deserving students who
want a degree from the University of Texas.
Jim Boon, executive direction of the association, says all UT supporters ar=
e
welcome to join, not just those who attended or graduated from Texas.
"We're letting people know you don't have to be a UT graduate to join the
only organization that serves all of UT-Austin," Boon said. "It's a matter =
of
pride that the country's largest university have the largest alumni
association"
"But even more importantly," he said, "we couldn't continue to reward
outstanding professors, encourage excellent teachers in our public schools,
talk to legislators about improvements in higher education and provide all =
of
our other behind-the-scenes services without growing our membership."
Boon pointed out that whille every UT graduate is a Texas Ex, not every UT
graduate is a member of the Ex-Students Association. To learn more about
member benefits, call the Ex-Students' Association at 512-471-3819 or
800-369-0023 or visit their website at: www.TexasExes.org
