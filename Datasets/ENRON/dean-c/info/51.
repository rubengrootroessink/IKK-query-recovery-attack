> Brown Says Buffs Pose Real Problem; No TV for Game at Missouri
>
> Coach Mack Brown said  Monday Colorado will be the best running team
Texas
>
> will see this year and he also said the Buffaloes have the best offensive

> line the Horns will face.
> The two teams play at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in a game that will be televised

> regionally by ABC. The Longhorns, 5-1, are a 10-point favorite over the
> Buffaloes, also 5-1.
> Brown said DE Kalen Thornton, who missed the Oklahoma State game with a
> sprained knee, is expected to return to practice Tuesday and he said that
> is
> very good news because Colorado has such a powerful running game that the

> Longhorns will need every available defensive lineman to try to stop it.
> "This is the best running team we have seen since the last time we played

> Nebraska," he  said. "They have a big, physical line, and some big,
> physical
> backs."
> He said Oklahoma uses its passing game to set up its running game. He
said
>
> Colorado is the opposite. "They run to set up their play-action passes,"
> he
> said. "They have a very good offense, and their quarterback (Craig) Ochs
> is a
> good passer and he can hurt you running. We'll have a battle."
> The Longhorns probably will be back in their basic 4-3 defense against
the
>
> run-oriented Buffs, and Brown said sophomore DT Adam Doiron, who started
> against Oklahoma State, "played really well" and will start again. Fellow

> sophomore Marcus Tubbs is a fixture at the other tackle spot.
> If Thornton is able to return, Brown said that will give the coaches
> freedom
> to use Maurice Gordon at end or tackle. Gordon, a former end, was a
> starting
> tackle until Thornton got hurt, and then he moved back to end.
> He said the Longhorns have to work hard to run a lot against Colorado's
> tough
> run defense because "they like to dominate time of possession with their
> running game and just wear the other team down. We try to wear the other
> team
> down, too, so that's going to be interesting."
> The Longhorns have won 11 straight games at home. That is the longest
home
>
> winning streak since the early 1980s. They also are 19-2 at home since
> Brown
> took over.
> Brown said true freshman RB Cedric Benson will start and Ivan Williams
> also
> will play quite a bit against Colorado. "Cedric did a good job," Brown
> said,
> "and Ivan did  well when he came in late. We want Cedric to get a lot of
> carries, but probably not 31 like he got against Oklahoma State. We'll
> probably spread it out a little more."
> He also said TE Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards are going to start getting
> more
> chances to catch passes. "They can really run, and we've got to work them

> into the offense a little more and give them more chances," he said.

> The Longhorns 'game at Missouri on October 27 was not chosen for TV, but
> UT
> officials have asked the Missouri athletic director to approve a pay TV

> p.m.
> or later to be approved for pay TV because the Big 12 has a rule that pro

> Ironically, the two longest Big 12 trips last year - to Colorado and
