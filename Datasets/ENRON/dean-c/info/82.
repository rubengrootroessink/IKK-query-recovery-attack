> TE-LB David Thomas Picks Horns over Sooners, Raiders
>
> TE-LB David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Class 4A power Wolfforth Frenship
> committed to Texas Sunday, picking the Longhorns over Oklahoma and Texas
> Tech. He also had offers from Texas A&M, LSU, Purdue, Oklahoma State and
> Baylor. He had attended camps at his big three - Texas, Oklahoma and
Texas
>
> Tech - before picking the Longhorns.
> When I asked him what factors led him to choose Texas, he said, "It has
> been
> a dream of mine since I was a little boy to play football for the
> University
> of Texas. This is a dream come true for me."
> Thomas is an outstanding tight end who set school records at Frenship
last
>
> year with 57 receptions for 1,104 yards and 14 touchdowns. But he might
be
>
> even better on defense. He had 141 tackles last year and is on Dave
> Campbell's Texas Football's Super Team as a linebacker.
> But Texas and most of the other schools after him see him as a tight end.
> He
> will make the tough catch across the middle and then do something with
it.
> He
> also is very sure handed and is a devastating blocker.
> He was the first freshman to play on the varsity at Frenship, then
started
>
> all 13 games at safety as a sophomore before making first-team All State
> at
> tight end as a junior last season. He also had 141 tackles as a
linebacker
>
> and safety.
> He's also a fine student, with a 4.0 GPA on a 4-point scale and a 27 ACT
> score.
> Thomas is the Longhorns' eight commitment this summer, joining Wide

> Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don
> Malone,
> 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North Lamar;  RB/Athlete Clint Haney, 5-11,
> 190,
> 4.27 of Smithson Valley; OL Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood,

> Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos and Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8,
> of
> Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in
Arizona.
> Davis, a graduate of Austin Lanier, was on all the top national 100 lists

> RECRUTING NOTES: LB Garnett Smith6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Houston,
> came

with

came
>
> very close to committing, but said he isn't quite ready. He also told me
> he
> is considering Tennessee, Florida and Penn State, "but Texas is No. 1."
He
> is
> one of the top linebackers in the state because of his speed and the way
> he
> plays all out all the time. . . OL Justin Blaylock of Plano East told me
> he
> was weighed and measured at 6-3, 340 at the Nike camp at A&M and still
ran
> a
> pair of 5.0 40s. Folks, that is extremely impressive. He also favors the
> Longhorns, as does DE Larry Dibbles, 6-2, 270, 4.8, of Lancaster. . . The

> FOOTBALL NOTES: The Texas-Texas A&M game in College Station the Friday
> after
> Thanksgiving has been set for an 11 p.m. kickoff for national television,

> with the Nebraska-Colorado game getting the more desirable afternoon
slot.
> I
> like it that the TV guys are alternating the morning and evening between
> the
> North and South in the Big 12, but I don't like the way they alternate it

> every year so that the morning kickoff for the Aggies and Longhorns is
> always
> when the game is at A&M. It should be set so that each school gets one
> home
> and one away morning kickoff every two years. That would mean the
> Longhorn-Aggie game would need to be a morning game for two years in a
> row,
> then an afternoon game for two straight years. . . Cedric Benson's pro
> baseball career means the Longhorns have an extra scholarship. Ricky
> Williams
> didn't count against the 85-scholarship limit when he was at UT because
of
>
> his pro baseball summer job, and Benson's won't count either. Let's hope
