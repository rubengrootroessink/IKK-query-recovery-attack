> Freshman CB Ross Leaves Team, Plans to Return in January
>
> Longhorn freshman CB Aaron Ross of Tyler  has left the Longhorn football
> squad to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse issues, head coach Mack Brown
> announced Friday.
> "I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in  order to
> rejoin
> the team," Ross said.  "I'm going to get those issues worked out so I can

> return to  Texas in January."
> LB Aurmon Satchell of Denver had the same problem a year ago and he is
> back
> on the team now and contending for playing time as a freshman. Hopefully,

> Ross will work out the problems, as Satchell did, and return to the team.
> If he gets the problems resolved by January, he can go through spring
> training with the team next year.
> Federal laws prohibit university officials discussing academic problems,
> so
> no reason was given for Ross leaving the team. However, it probably is
> either
> an improvement in the SAT or ACT score that was disallowed as being
> excessive
> or a course that Tyler High School officials counted as a core course and
> the
> Clearinghouse folks didn't think was a core course.
> Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said last week that Ross probably would
> be
> play in the Longhorns' first game and had a good chance to be his dime
> back
> (sixth defensive back in passing situations). Two other true freshmen,
> Michael Huff and Cedric Griffin, will be competing for that job now.
> The first day of classes at UT will be Wednesday and the Longhorns will
> open
> the 2000 football season on Saturday, September 1, vs. New Mexico  State
> at 6
> p. m. in Austin in  a game that will be nationally televised by the Fox
> Network.

> FOOTBALL NOTES: Head Coach Mack Brown has closed all regular season
> practices
> to the press. Reporters will be allowed to talk to Brown, his assistants
> and
> players after practice. This is a departure from last season when
> reporters
> were allowed to attend practice every Tuesday. During the season, the big

> practice days are Tuesday and Wednesday. . . With freshman Cedric Benson
> looking even better than expected and sophomore Ivan Williams displaying
> his
> usual spring brilliance in the fall, too, the Longhorns are in much
better
>
> shape at running back than any of us had a right to expect. Junior Victor
> Ike
> is the starter, and he looks bigger and stronger than he has been in the
> past, but Benson and Williams will play a lot, too. . . Senior Maurice
> Gordon
> and freshman Stevie Lee had very good performances in the final scrimmage

> Wednesday night and they should be able to make the problems at defensive

> tackle go away. Sophomore Marcus Tubbs is solid at one DT, and Gordon,
Lee
>
> and sophomore Adam Doiron will all be able to help, giving the team four
> capable tackles. . . Look for a lot more four-wideout and two-tight end
> formations with just one running back this season because third WR Sloan
> Thomas and second TE Brock Edwards are better than most teams' starters.

> The Longhorns will have the best receiving corps (wide receivers and
tight
>
> ends) and one of the best defensive secondaries in college football. They

> also will have a fine pass-blocking offensive line, and a very good
> defensive
> line. That means the season's success will depend on how the offensive
> line
> blocks for the run, and how well QB Chris Simms, the linebackers and the
> special teams perform.
> RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are in great shape with several national
> top
> 100 players and two of them, WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and
DE
>
> Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, might make early September
decisions.

Anderson,

> 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale
