Football Practice Roundup

Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a different kind of two-a-day
workouts this year and he and the players both think it is the way to go in
the future.
With the wave of football-related deaths hitting the pros, the colleges and
the high schools, he decided to only have one workout on days when the team
worked during the hottest time of the day.
A typical week of practice included 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. workouts on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, and 3 p.m. workouts on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Brown said it kept the players fresher (and safer) and he also said they will
be better prepared to start the season.
"They handled the heat really well, and worked hard in every practice," he
said. "We've had some problems early in the season since I've been here, and
I think this kind of schedule gives us a better chance to be stronger at the
start of the season."
Brown had three game-type scrimmages during the pre-season work.
The final one went about 90 minutes last Wednesday night before about 4,000
fans and the first-team offense and first-team defense were dominant.
"The ones were dominant," Brown said, "and that's the way you want it. We ran
the ball well and threw it and caught it well, and we played good defense for
the most part."
The first-team defense had five QB sacks, with LBs Tyrone Jones and Everick
Rawls, DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and DT Maurice Gordon getting one
each.
Gordon got most of the first-team snaps at DT opposite Marcus Tubbs.
Brown said Tubbs has won a starting job, but the other DT spot is still up
for grabs.
Freshman Stevie Lee also looked good working with the second team at DT and
going against the first-team line. He appears to be recovered from off-season
foot surgery. He is a run stopped deluxe who is getting better at rushing the
passer.
Freshman RB Cedric Benson, running primarily with the second team, had his
best scrimmage. He gained 75 yards on 13 carries.
His was very impressive on a four-play 26-yard drive with the second team
against a mixture of first-and-second-team defenders.
He carried the ball four straight times, getting 6 and then 5 to set up a
first down at the 15, then bolting 14 yards on a draw play, breaking several
tackles along the way. He scored easily on the next play from the 1.
Benson seems to have better vision and be quicker through holes than the
other Longhorn backs. It also takes great penetration by the defense to keep
the heralded freshman from making positive yardage.
The Longhorns worked primarily on the running game in the final scrimmage.
Brown has said several times that UT must run the ball better in big games
and he said after the scrimmage he is encouraged by the way the backs are
running and the linement are blocking.
He was asked after the scrimmage why TE Bo Scaife has not been involved more
in the passing game. "We know Bo can catch and make things happen after he
catches it," Brown said. "We've been working Bo more on runs because he needs
to work on his blocking. That's the area where he needs to improve."
Brown also said at least three freshmen will play in the opener Sept. 1
against New Mexico State - Benson, outside linebacker Derrick Johnson and
walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum.
Asked why they are assured of playing, Brown laughed and said, "Cedric is
really, really productive. Derrick is 6-5, 215 and he runs really fast. Dusty
has been doing a good job in an area that was a problem for us in the
spring."
He also said Mangum will be the place-kicker and also might kick off.

Baseball Prospects Promising

The Longhorn baseball team begins fall workouts in September with most of its
top performers returning, plus a great group of new players.
Iowa State dropped baseball after last season and the Longhorns got the
Cyclones' ace pitcher, Alan Bomar, a hard-throwing right-hander who was one
of the top hurlers in the Big 12 last year.
They also signed two other pitchers who will compete for starting jobs. They
are Brad Halsey, a left-hander from Hill County JC who throws in the lows
90s, and Jesin Merrle, a right-hander from Navarro JC with a fine assortment
of pitches.
Five pitchers who saw a lot of action last year also return. They are Ray
Clark, Ryan France, Justin Simmons, Eugene Espineli and Bradley Jordan.
Ryan Hubele returns at catcher and Jeff Ontiveros will be at first base. Both
hit with power.
Speedy Timmy Moss is back at second base and prize freshman Michael Holliman
of Dallas Jesuit, who turned down a pro offer of more than $1 million to come
to Texas, probably will be at shortstop.
Omar Quintinilla, who suffered severe facial injuries in a collision with a
teammate last season, was having a great year at bat when the season-ending
injury occurred.
He played shortstop last year as a freshman, but will move to third base and
will add some pop to the batting lineup.
Another top middle infielder is Brandon Fahey, of Duncanville and Grayson
County JC. He is an outstanding hitter who could be the designated hitter if
he doesn't win a starting job.
Starting outfielders Ben King, Kaloni Napolean and Matt Rosenberg all return,
along with Eric Sultemeir, who played a lot as a freshman last season.
The Horns also added a top centerfielder in Joe Ferin of Westark JC. He was
All-Big 12 as a freshman at Iowa State in 1999 before transferring to Westark
for the 2000 season.
He has outstanding speed and is a fine hitter.
The Longhorns made it to the regional finals last year. With Quintinilla
returning healthy and the other returning starters, plus the influx of new
talent, this team has the potential to be much better.

Soccer Team Starts Strong

The Texas women's soccer team completed a 6-0-1 wing of Europe last week with
a 3-2 victory over Saestrum, the Dutch  League Champion, in Zeist, Utrecht,
NL.
The UT team, ranked No. 18 nationally, had three shutouts in the seven
matches and outscored their opponents by a 32-6 margin.
Leading the Longhornsoffensively in Europe were freshmen Kelly Wilson of
Odessa Permian and Kristen Teter of Kingwood, who finished the trip ranked 
first and second on the club,  respectively, in points scored with 14 and 12.
Wilson led the Horns with five goals and she and Teter tied for the team lead
in  assists with four.
Teter and sophomore Kylee Wosnuk of Folsom, California, tied for second on
the squad with four goals each during UT's European trip.
Up next, head coach Chris Petrucelli and theLonghorns officially kick off the
2001 campaign at 7 p.m. Friday at  Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field
against consensus No. 1 and  defending national champion North Carolina.
Tickets for individual matches are on sale through UTTM at (512) 477-6060 or
1-800-982-BEVO, while season tickets may be purchased by calling (512)
