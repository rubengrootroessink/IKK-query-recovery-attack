> Horns Favored Over Cougars by 30; Tech Game Set for 6 p.m. on Fox TV
>
> The Longhorns are 30-point favorites over the Houston Cougars for their 8

> p.m. game Saturday in Houston, but UT coach Mack Brown said Monday he
> anticipates a close game.
> Brown said the Cougars' only game, a  21-14 loss to Rice, is misleading
> because the Owls have their best defense in years. He said the Longhorns
> will
> need to be  ready to play all out.
> He also said sophomore Ivan Williams will be the starting tailback and he

> said freshman Cedric Benson also will see early action at tailback. "Ivan

> deserves a chance to be the first one out there," Brown said. "He has
> played
> well for us this season."
> Brown said the Cougars will be the first of three straight all-out
passing
>
> teams the Horns will face this season. Texas' next game is the one
against
>
> Texas Tech and then comes the big Dallas shootout with defending national

> champion Oklahoma.
> The Texas-Texas Tech game in Austin September 29 has been set for a  6
> p.m.
> kickoff and will be nationally televised on Fox Sports Net.  The game
> already

> One of the Longhorns' prize football commitments, DT Earl Anderson of San

> Marcos, has been suspended from the team for two games after he and a
> teammate - QB Jerry Montemayer - were arrested outside an Eckerd's Drug
> Store in San Marcos and charged with conspiring with two young female
> Eckerd
> cashiers to leave the store with merchandise they had not paid for.
Police
>
> said Anderson and Montemayor attempted to leave the store with unpaid
> merchandise valued at $274.89.
> The charge is a misdemeanor.
> San Marcos coach Bruce Bush said Montemayer has been dismissed from the

> because it was his second violation of team rules, while Anderson drew a
> two-game suspension because it was his first violation.

> QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar completed 8 of 14 passes for 163

> yards and two touchdowns and also ran for 58 net yards to lead his team
to
> a
> 35-20 victory over West Mesquite Friday. Malone's two touchdown passes
> were
> for 28 and 32 yards. He has committed to Texas. He has 430 yards passing
> in
> his team's 1-1 season.
> When I asked him what he considers his strongest suit, Malone said he
> feels
> like he has a strong arm and quick feet, but he said his biggest asset
> "might
> be my vision. I'm lucky to have a coach who stresses the need to see the
> entire field, and I work hard at that. I try to look at as many of my
> receivers as possible before throwing the ball."
> RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, the state's top running back and a top
> target
> of Longhorn recruiters, rushed for 278 yards and scored two touchdowns in
> a
> 21-0 romp past Crosby.
> Most of the top defensive ends in this year's recruiting class are more
> physical than fast, but two of the best speed rushers around are juniors
> who
> will headline next year's class of ends. They are Jarvis Moss, 6-5, 220,
> 4.5,
> of Class 4A power Denton Ryan, and Bruce Davis, 6-3, 230, 4.6, of  Clear
> Creek, who is the son of a former Houston Oiler star. . . LB Ta Ta
> Thompson,
> 6-3, 225, 4.5, of Garland, is another junior star who will be a top
> national
> recruit . . . Another junior who is drawing a lot of attention is RB
> Richuel
> Massey, 5-10, 200, 4.5, of Hillsboro, who also is one of the state's top
> power lifters. He has the speed to run outside and the power to run
> inside. .
> . I saw another top junior Friday night in Lufkin. He is Terrance Parks,
a
>
> 6-4, 220-pounder with 4.5 speed who plays TE, WR and QB for the Panthers.
> He

guard
