Scouting Texas Tech

Texas travels to Lubbock Saturday to take on dangerous Texas Tech in a 6 p.=
m.
game that will be televised by the Fox Network.
The Red Raiders are 6-3 overall and 2-3 in the Big 12, with losses to
Nebraska, Kansas State and Texas A&M.
Tech, under new coach Mike Leach, opened the season with a 24-3 win over Ne=
w
Mexico, then whipped Utah State, 38-16, and North Texas, 13-7, before
wrapping up the non-conference slate with a 26-0 shutout of
Lousiana-Lafayette.
The Raiders fell at Texas A&M, 33-15, to open league play. Then they
whitewashed Baylor, 28-0, before getting hammered by Nebraska, 56-3. Then
they scared Kansas State in Manhattan before falling, 28-23.
They outscored Kansas, 45-39, Saturday in Lawrence, with sophomore QB Kliff
Kingsbury hitting WR Derek Dorris for four touchdowns.
Leach is the guy who found Josh Heupel and lured him to Oklahoma last seaso=
n
when he was the Sooners' offensive coordinator.
The Sooners' offensive success last year propeled him to the head job at
Texas Tech and his offense is a pass first, pass second and pass third
offense, just like the one the Sooners use.
The difference, however, is that there is only one Heupel. But Kingsbury is
very good. He's a sophomore who has thrown a nation's leading 431 passes th=
is
year and who has hit 60.1% of them.
He is No. 8 in the nation in total offense, averaging 285.6 yards per game.
One scary statistic is Texas Tech's lofty No. 2 ranking in pass defense. Th=
e
Raiders are giving up only 146.2 yards per game passing and they have
intercepted 10 passes.
If the Longhorns don't run any better than they have been running, they wil=
l
have to have some success throwing to have a chance to win.
One other worrisome thing is that Texas Tech is the second best team the
Longhorns have played to this point. Oklahoma, with a 7-0 record, is the on=
ly
other team the Horns have played with a winning record right now.
To win in Lubbock, the Longhorns have to pressure Kingsbury and the offense
and defense both have to remember to show up in the first quarter.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                             Texas Tech

Big 12 Roundup

The conference races have narrowed down to three teams in each division and
the Northern Division will come down to just two teams after this week
because Iowa State travels to Kansas State in an elimination game.
Two huge games are on tap next week when Oklahoma visits Texas A&M and
Nebraska travels to Kansas State. If the Sooners and Huskers both win, the
races are as good as over and you can count on them meeting again in Kansas
City on December 2.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns are still at 19 commitments and are headed toward another
national top 10 class, and possibly a top five class if things break right =
at
the end.
* * * *
Longhorn prize recruit Cedric Benson had 27 carries for 313 yards and all
three touchdowns on runs of 4, 22 and 82 yards to lead Midland Lee past
arch-rival Odessa Permian, 19-0. It was his sixth career 300-yard game.
Benson has rushed for 7,121 yards, the 10th highest total ever for a Texas
high school player and the best ever for one in the state's highest
classification.
He won't have the awesome stats he had last year (3,500 yds, 51 TDs) becaus=
e
he is one of two offensive starters left from Lee's great back-to-back stat=
e
championship teams, but he looks even bigger and faster this year than he w=
as
last year.
T. J. Mills, Permian's coach, said, "My kids hit him and hit him and hit hi=
m,
but he's a load. If you don't get a lot of hats on him on every play, he'll
hurt you."
Don Shows, the highly successful coach at West Monroe, La., had much the sa=
me
thing to say after his team mauled Lee, 38-6, in an early-season game.
Lee's lone TD came on a 78-yard run by Benson, and it came on the third pla=
y
of the game. Shows, whose teams are 89-3 since 1995, said, "We don't usuall=
y
give up runs like that, and we stopped him pretty good most of the time. Bu=
t
our game plan was to have a lot of people on him on every play, and even
then, he made some tough, tough yardage. He's a hard back to stop, especial=
ly
if he gets a little room."
* * * *
Not much has changed in the last week. The Longhorns are still waiting on
several key players to make their decisions.
They will sign six to seven more players, and several of the remaining
scholarships are likely to go to  S Dewayne Brandon of Temple, LB Derrick
Johnson of Waco, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and DE Jonathan Jackson
and TE James Moses, both of Galena Park North Shore.
They fill the key requirements: they like the Horns and the Horns like them=
.
The most important recruit remaining is super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison, and others still considering Texas are  Athletes Quan Cosby of Mar=
t
and Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston
Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville.
Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is still a possibility, but he has some
academic hurdles.
The Longhorns have as good a chance as anyone with Harris, but he says he i=
s
still considering six or seven schools and says he is wide open.
Harris said he came to the Missouri game Oct. 21 but got there late and
didn't get to visit with the other recruits. Harris said he had a good time
and said Texas remains one of his top choices.

RECRUITING NOTES: Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., picked Florida
State over Texas and Boston College. . . One top UT recruit, OL Mike Garcia
of Galena Park, is out for the rest of the season with a torn ACL, but he
says he will be ready for two-a-days next August in Austin.
