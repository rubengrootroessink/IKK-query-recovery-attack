Quan Cosby Signs 5-Year Pact with Angels, Gives Up Football

Quan Cosby of Mart, one of the Longhorns' prize recruits, signed a
five-year
baseball contract with the California Angels and said his football playing
days are over.
It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other
Longhorns. You just don't expect a sixth-round draft choice to get enough
money to give up football. But Cosby told me he got close to first-round
money. "I told them what it would take for me to give up football, and
that's
what they came up with," he said.
Cosby, a fleet wide receiver who was expected to see action at Texas this
season, said baseball is "easier on the body, so I probably will be able to
play baseball longer than I could have played football."
Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career
doesn't work out as planned, he said, "That's a possibility, but I'm
figuring
on playing baseball for a long time."
Texas A&M QB Marki Farris is an example of a player who tried pro baseball,
then returned to play college football after several years.
Cosby declined to say how much he signed for, but did say it included
tuition
and fees to attend Texas for four years to get his degree.
UT head coach Mack Brown said, "The reason a young man comes to college is
to
better his life and we gave Quan an opportunity to do that. If he feels it
is
better for him to play professional baseball, then we are excited for him.
We're disappointed short-term that he will not be coming to Texas this
fall,
but if he ever decides he wants to give up baseball and come to college
we'd
be happy to have him."

Cosby's decision to go the pro baseball route probably will mean the
Longhorns will try to sign three wide receivers this year. They had homed
in
on Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Illinois, and Anthony Wright of Klein
Forest, but they probably will step up their efforts on Xavier McQuire of
Dallas Carter and DaBryan Blanton of Forney. Blanton is a running back at
Forney, but his slight build and blazing speed (20.37 fully automatic 200
meters at the state meet) will see him move to wide receiver or cornerback
at
the next level.
McQuire was at the Texas summer camp that ended today (Wednesday) and he
said
he had a good time, but was still considering several schools.
DE Dontriel Coates, 6-3, 270, 4.8, of Anahuac, attended the Texas mini-camp
Sunday and is being recruited by the Longhorns. He says his big three are
Kentucky, Texas and Arkansas. On tape, he looks like a fine outside pass
rusher. Like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, a Longhorn pledge, he has an
explosive start.
The Longhorns didn't appear to get any additional commitments Wednesday,
but
that could change Thursday when all the kids get home. I told you in my
last
e-mail/fax about the new NCAA rule interpretation that prohibits coaches
taking commitments at summer camps.
Texas has four early commitments. In addition to Anderson, they are DT Lyle
Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, DT  Sonny Davis, who is attending junior
college in Mississippi after graduating from Austin Lanier, and  OL Brett
Valdez of Brownwood.

Marc Pittman, father of Cole Pittman, the UT defensive tackle who was
killed
in an automobile accident in February, was at the Longhorn practice
Wednesday
with his other son, DE Chase Pittman, a top 100 national recruit, plus
several other Shreveport Evangel stars, including John David Booty, a  6-2,
195-pound quarterback who might be the nation's top sophomore prospect, and
another outstanding sophomore, DE Chris Bowers, 6-3, 232. He also brought
two
top defensive backs who are being highly recruited from Evangel. They are
Jonathan Wade, 5-10, 175, 4.3 (he ran a 10.25 100 meters in April), and
Chad
Johnson, 5-11, 185, 4.4.

BASEBALL NOTES: James Sweeney, the outstanding catcher Texas signed, has
inked a pro contract, and  Vincent Sinisi, the top slugger the Horns signed
a
year ago, has transferred to Rice after redshirting this year at Texas
because of persistent problems with a rib injury.
