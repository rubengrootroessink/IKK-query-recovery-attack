Hi Sweetie,
?
How are you?? I got up about an hour  ago.? I went to bed pretty late last 
night-probably because I slept a lot  yesterday and because I was cleaning.? 
My room looks a whole lot  better.? I'll probably be cleaning for a couple of 
days.? I just hope  that Bren cleans up her stuff so I don't have to.
?
I don't know when Em is supposed to be here,  she'd said she would call.? 
Anyway, Ray is coming to my graduation.?  That's nice, huh?? Now it's gonna 
be a total of 13 people here!? He  going to be in Austin tomorrow.? He's 
going to stay here all weekend.?  I don't know where I'm going to put 
everyone!
?
I have rehearsal at 7:15 tonight, so call me  before 6:45, okay?
?
I'll be checking my email all day......so say  hello!
?
Love you,
Jenn
