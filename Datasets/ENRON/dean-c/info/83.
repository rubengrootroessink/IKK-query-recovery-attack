 Round Rock Westwood Wide Receiver Becomes 7th Commitment

 Wide receiver Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood said
 Thursday he called UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis and committed to
 the
 Longhorns. He is Texas' seventh early committment.
 Miksch ran a 4.35 40 at the Texas A&M Nike camp and followed that with a
 4.4
 at the Texas camp that ended Wednesday. "I won the fastest man contest at
 both camps," he said. He also ran a 10.53 100 meters last track season.
 Miksch, the son of former Longhorn WR Donnie Miksch, a 1977-78 letterman
 from
 Needville, said Purdue, Nebraska, A&M, Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all
 recruiting him. He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to
 their
 summer camps. "I'll have to call both of them and tell them I won't be
 coming
 to their camps," he said.
 He caught 46 passes for 676 yards and five touchdowns for the 4-6 Warriors

 last season.
 Houston Madison's Donald Burgs, one of the state's top cornerback
 recruits,
 also attended the UT camp that ended Wednesday. He had  been a strong
 Texas
 lean earlier, but he know says he is wide open and probably won't commit
 to
 anyone this summer.
 Burgs praised Miksch when I talked to him Wednesday night. When I asked
 him
 if anyone at the camp really impressed him, he said, "There was a wide
 receiver from Round Rock named Dustin something who was really good. He
 was
 hard to cover and he has really good speed. He has good hands, too."
 The Longhorn coaches can't comment on recruits, but Burgs wasn't the only
 one
 Miksch impressed because the Texas coaches usually try to sign larger wide

 receivers.
 "I've been a Longhorn fan all my life," Miksch said. "I've always gone to
 the
 games and it gives me the chills when the players run through that smoke
 before the game. This was an easy choice for me when Texas offered a
 scholarship. This is where I've always wanted to play."
 Texas  got commitments Monday from QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7,
 of
 Paris North Lamar, and RB/Athlete Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson

 Valley.
 Malone and Haney both attended the UT mini-camp Sunday, then got offers
 Monday from the Longhorns due to the new NCAA rule interpretation that
 doesn't allow kids to commit at summer camps. Normally, both would have
 been
 offered by coach Mack Brown at the conclusion of their mini-camp sessions.
 The Longhorns' other commitments are from DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos,
 OL
 Brett Valdez of Brownwood, DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and DT

 Sonny Davis, who signed with Texas last year, but is having to go to a
 junior
 college in Mississippi because he failed to qualify academically.
 Speaking of academically qualifying, only two of the Longhorns' February
 signees are still in limbo after CB Aaron Ross of Tyler qualified earlier
 this week. The two who are still trying to make it academically are RB
 Anthony Johnson of Jefferson and LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison.
 (Editor's Note: I don't put out as much  academic information as I did in
 earlier years because (a) it is not a good subject for internet bulletin
 boards, and (b) it tends to irritate the high school coaches. So, please
 use
 this information judiciously.)
 Super RB Cedric Benson says the only way he will sign a pro baseball
 contract
 is if he gets an offer that lets him play college football, like Ricky
 Williams did when he was at Texas. The Midland Lee star has a chance to
 solve the Longhorns' problems at running back, and he says he is raring to

 get that chance.

 BASKETBALL NOTES: Ed Kohtala, who has been an assistant to UT head
 baskeball
 coach Rick Barnes since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago, has been
 named
 head coach at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. Barnes is expected to name a

 replacement in the next couple of weeks.

 CATCH 22: A guy who made an internet post some time back accusing me by
 name
 of trying to kill Texas' football recruiting, put a post on an internet
 bul
 letin board yesterday saying Texas needs to recruit a quarterback this
 time around because the Horns didn't get one last year. That's his
 sarcastic
 way of ridiculing Matt Nordgren, UT's QB signee last February. Classy
 posts
 like that are sure to help Texas recruiting (sarcasm intended). I don't
 post
 on the internet, but those of you who do ought to use good judgment since
 stupid posts like that don't exactly help our image.
