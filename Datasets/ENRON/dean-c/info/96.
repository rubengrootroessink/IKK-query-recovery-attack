> Longhorns Have First Full-Team Practices; UT Ranked No. 5 by AP
>
> The Longhorns had their first two full-team practices Saturday, and coach

> Mack Brown said he is pleased with the way the players went all out in
> both
> drills.
> "We're doing it a little differently this year," Brown said, noting that
> he
> is alternating between two workouts a day and one workout a day. When he
> has
> two workouts, like he did Saturday, there is an early morning and a late
> evening workout. Then he follows that with a single workout at 3 p.m. the

> next day, like he is doing Sunday.
> "We haven't started well here," he said, pointing to four early-season
> losses
> since he has been at Texas. "It doesn't get as hot in North Carolina as
it
>
> does here, so we checked with some pro teams in hot-weather cities and
> we're
> doing what they do."
> He said all coaches are concerned about the football deaths that have
> occurred in pro and college football already this pre-season, and he said
> the
> early and late workouts should help players avoid losing so much fluid.
He
>
> has always had water breaks in practice and he is still having frequent
> water
> breaks.
> Brown talked about problem areas in the pre-season, and he mentioned
> three:
> (1) the loss of both starting defensive tackles, (2) the lack of a proven

> tailback, and (3) the necessity of finding two new kickers, one to do the

> punting and one to do the place kicking.
> He said sophomore Marcus Tubbs, who is close to 290 pounds and very
quick,
>
> played well last year when Shaun Rogers was hurt and looks good at one
> defensive tackle. Redshirt freshman Stevie Lee and sophomore Adam Doiron
> both
> worked some with the first team at the other tackle. Lee is coming off
> foot
> surgery, but showed no signs of weakness and looked good. Former
defensive
>
> end Maurice Gordon looked great as a pass-rushing tackle in the spring
and
> he
> still looks very quick and very formidable.
> Brown said he hopes junior Victor Ike will step up at tailback, and also
> said
> the coaches want to look at highly touted freshmen Cedric Benson. Ike
> worked
> very hard in the off season and is sporting some new muscles.
> He said JC transfer Brian Bradford is looking very good as the team
> punter,
> and said he is encouraged with the place-kicking of true freshman
walk-ons
>
> David Pino and Dusty Mangum
> Linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins worked at defensive end
Saturday.
>
> Brown said they will continue to work at linebacker, too, but might play
> some
> at end until O. J. McClintock returns. McClintock is out indefinitely
> after
> suffering slashed muscles and tendons when he accidentally rammed his
hand
>
> and arm though a window.

> Texas was ranked fifth in the nation in the pre-season Associated Press
> Top
> 25 Poll which was released Saturday. It was the Longhorns' highest
> pre-season
> ranking since being ranked No. 3 in 1983.
> The Horns received five first place votes and were one of five schools to

> earn votes for the top spot. Florida opens the season at No. 1, followed
> by
> Miami, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Texas, giving the Big 12 three of the top
> five
> spots.
> The Longhorns have been in the top 25 in 37 of 42 AP polls since head
> coach
> Mack Brown took over in December of 1997.
> The No. 5 ranking by the AP writers comes one week after the ESPN/USA
> Today
> Coaches and Football Writers Association of America tabbed UT No. 6 in
> their
> pre-season poll.
> One positive factor that gives this team a better chance to finish in the
> top
> 10 than Brown's previous teams at Texas is the overall depth. His second
> team
> at UT was 9-2 and on a roll when the wide receivers and starting QB Major

> Applewhite got hurt, sick or in the case of Kwame Cavil, got suspended.
It
>
> lost its last three games.
> This team has much better depth and is two deep in quality players at
most
>
> positions.

> RECRUITING NOTES: The state's top running back, Albert Hardy of Galena
> Park,
> was at Saturday morning's practice, and he drew a lot of attention from
> all
> the UT coaches. He looks at least as big as the 5-11, 225, he is supposed
> to
> be. He is a power runner deluxe with speed to take it to the outside. The

> offense UT has run since the present staff arrived is ideal for him. . .
> The
> state's top player, DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, attended one of
> the
> Thursday practices and he also drew lot of attention from the coaches.
One
>
> reason he is so highly rated (and I rated him highly before anyone else
> way
> back last September when he was just starting his junior year) is that b
> lockers don't slow him down very much. Single-teams, double-teams, even
> triple-teams are just minor nuisances for him. He stays so low and is so
> explosive that the best chance to avoid him is to run away from him as
> fast
> as possible. . . Two UT commitments also attended Longhorn practices this

> week. WR Dustin Miksch of Roud Rock Westwood was at the Saturday morning
> practice and LB Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally was at one of the
> Thursday drills.
