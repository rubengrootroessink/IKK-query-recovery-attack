> At Least Five Top Recruits Coming to Austin This Weekend
>
> Five top recruits have confirmed they are coming to Austin this weekend
> and
> at least three of them are coming on official visits.
> The three who will be taking official visits to Texas are all
linebackers.
>
> They are Rufus Alexander, 6-2, 215, 4.49, of Baton Rouge Christian Life;
> A.
> J. Nicholson, 6-2, 240, 4.6, of Winston Salem Mount Tabor, and Michael
> Williams, 6-3, 220, 4.6, of Lindale.
> Alexander is one of the top recruits in Louisiana, Nicholson is one of
> North
> Carolina's top blue-chippers and Williams is emerging as one of the most
> coveted recruits in Texas.
> Two other national top 100 recruits will be in Austin this weekend, and
> one
> of them, TE Eric Winston, 6-6, 275, 4.9, of Midland Lee, also might be on
> an
> official visit. He is considering taking his official visit the Dec. 14
> weekend so he can attend the UT football banquet. If he decides to visit
> officially that weekend, his trip to Austin this weekend would be an
> unofficial visit.
> The other blue-chipper who confirmed he is coming to the UT-Kansas game
is
> QB
> Vincent Young, 6-5, 200, 4.5, of Houston Madison.
> Young is as good a quarterback prospect as there is in the nation. Texas
> and
> Miami are his top two schools right now. Winston also is considering
Texas
>
> and Miami, along with Texas A&M.
> Alexander, who has scholarship offers from most of the Southeastern
> Conference powers, is leaning toward Texas, but also is considering
> Alabama,
> Tennessee and Florida.
> Nicholson committed to North Carolina during the summer, but decommitted
> when
> the Tar Heels lost their first three games. He is considering Texas,
North
>
> Carolina and several other ACC and SEC schools.
> Williams committed to Oklahoma on a visit about three weeks ago, but then

> decommitted and visited Texas A&M and Texas Tech. He had planned to visit

> Texas the Dec. 14 weekend, but told me tonight he decided to take his
> official visit now because "I'm getting kind of tired of recruiting." He
> said
> he expects to make a decision soon, and said no one has an edge right
now.
> The Longhorns also are trying to get Lance Mitchell, a 6-2, 240-pound
> inside
> linebacker from City College of San Francisco to visit. He runs under 4.6
> in
> the 40 and is one of the top junior college prospects in the country. He
> said
> he is considering visiting Texas, but has not set a date.
> Texas has 16 commitments right now, and LB Garnet Smith of Arlington
Lamar
>
> now says he is a solid UT pledge. "I'm going to sign with Texas," he
said.
> He
> has committed at various times to Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
> * * * *
> Coach Mack Brown said Wednesday the Longhorns have been practicing very
> hard
> this week. He said the team has great senior leadership and has come to
> realize that top five teams have to show up ready to  practice hard every
> day
> and play hard every Saturday.
> He also said OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes, who missed the last two games with a
> sprained ankle, should be able to play against Kansas. "He worked out the

> last two days, and we think he'll be able to play." Brown said Beau Baker

> played at a very high level when he was called upon at Baylor when
Tillman
>
> Holloway suffered a shoulder injury.
> Holloway won't play against Kansas because of a sore shoulder and will be

> examined again next week to determine if he can resume practicing.
> With Derrick Dockery and Baker the only completely healthy front-line
> guards,
> Brown said center Matt Anderson is ready to play at guard if needed, and
> Jason Glynn  could move in at center.
> "It seems like we have one position where we get a lot of injuries each
> year," he said. "Last year, it was the tight ends who got hurt. This
year,
>
> it's the offensive guards."
