That Elusive Top 10

Is this the year the Longhorns finally will finish in that elusive top 10
nationally for the first time since 1983?
The Longhorns are in the top 10 right now at No. 9 in the AP poll and they
will stay in that elite group and even rise a little if they keep winning.
The biggest remaining obstacle to keeping winning is the game Saturday
against 5-1 Colorado.
The Longhorns are 10-point favorites over the Buffaloes, but Colorado, at 5-1
and with a five-game winning streak, is the most dangerous foe left on the
schedule.
Next up will be road trips to 2-3 Missouri ande 2-3 Baylor, teams which have
one Big 12 victory between them this season, followed by a game in Austin
against Kansas, also 2-3.
The Longhorns will be huge favorites in all three of those game.
Then comes the regular season finale at Texas A&M. The Aggies lost to
Colorado, 31-21, Saturday in Boulder to fall from the unbeaten ranks, but the
toughest part of their schedule remains to be played.
If  the Horns keep winning until the A&M game, they will be favored by at
least 10 points.
The Aggies have a good defense, but it isn't as good as the one at Texas, and
the Horns have a clear edge on offense.
So, barring an upset, the Longhorns should head for a bowl game at 10-1 and
with a national ranking in the top 5. A win in the bowl game would cement a
top 5 ranking, but a loss might knock the Horns just out of the top 10 in the
final poll.

Longhorn Game Notes . .

* After opening the game with a  12-play, 65-yard scoring drive, Oklahoma
State had six more possessions in the first half and gained 41 yards on 20
plays. In the second half, OSU started drives at the Texas 36 and 21 after
turnovers, but came away with zero points. After its opening TD drive,
Oklahoma State gained only  97 yards and had 163 for the game, its lowest
total of the season.
* QB Chris Simms was involved in all six  Texas touchdowns with a 1-yard
rushing TD and scoring passes of 27 yards to Brock Edwards, 5 and 16 yards to
Roy Williams and  27 and  23 yards to Sloan Thomas. He fell one short of the
UT record of seven set by Clyde Littlefield against Daniel Baker (4 pass/3
rush) in 1915. The last Longhorn to account for six touchdowns in a game was
Ricky Williams against Rice in 1998.
* Freshman LB Derrick Johnson had two tackles for losses in the first half to
move into a tie for third place on UT's all-time freshman list. He has 10
TFLs for the season, just six short of the Longhorns record held by Tony
Brackens who had 16 in 1993.
* Sophomore WR Sloan Thomas had six catches for 82 yards Saturday. Both were
career bests. His  previous highs were three catches against Missouri in 2000
and 74 yards against Texas A&M in 2000. He tied his career high with two TD
passes, last accomplishing the feat against Missouri.

UT No. 22 in Basketball Poll

The Longhorn men's basketball team has been ranked No. 22 in the ESPN.com
pre-season top 25.
Texas is one of five Big 12 Conference teams selected in the Top 25, joining
Kansas (5), Missouri (8), Oklahoma State (16) and Oklahoma (19).
The Longhorns return 57 percent of their scoring, 69 percent of their
rebounding and 63 percent of their minutes played totals from last year's
25-9 team which finished with a No. 18 national ranking in the AP poll.
Texas starts its exhibition schedule with the annual intrasquad scrimmage at
7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 31 at the Erwin Center.  Admission is free.
