UT Favored by 45; Brown Says He'll Name QB Just Before Kickoff

The Longhorns are 45-point favorites over Louisiana-Lafayette for
Saturday's
11:30 a.m. season opener in Austin. For those of you who don't live in
Austin
and who plan to come to the game, this is the hottest summer I have seen in
Austin, with temperatures hitting 105, 106 and 107 with disturbing
regularity, so I would advise you to wear something cool and arrange to
have
plenty of liquids to drink.
The team returned to practice Monday after getting three days off to
recuperate from 2-a-days, and freshman WR Roy Williams made a spectacular
catch of a ball that looked like it was over everyone.
Coach Mack Brown said he won't name a starting quarterback publicly until
the
game starts, and won't even break the news to Major Applewhite and Chris
Simms, the two quarterbacks who are competing for the starting job, until
Saturday morning. "We want to watch them in practice all week," Brown said.
He also said both QBs are working hard and competing for the starting job.
"We have told our team we have two starters," Brown said. "We are just
happy
they are both really good. In making these decisions, we will try to take
care of both of them and do what is best for the team."
All of the injured starters who missed some time last week were back at
practice Monday, but they didn't run with the first team. Brown said, "as
of
today," redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway would start at left guard
because
Derrick Dockery missed most of last week, sophomore Cole Pittman would
start
ahead of Cory Redding at DE because Redding was injured last week, and
Roderick Babers, who is locked in a battle with Ervis Hill, at CB, would
get
the nod because Hill missed some workouts with an injury.
But the game isn't today, and Brown said the players who were hurt will
have
an opportunity this week to regain their starting jobs.
Brown also said he hasn't decided whether to start any true freshmen, and
said he probably won't make a final decision on that until close to game
time, too, "because sometimes you tell a freshman he is going to start, and
he starts hyperventilating."
Whether or not they start, freshman WRs Williams and B. J. Johnson will
play
early and often. They are the most impressive freshmen wide receivers I
have
seen at Texas. Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney were a very good pair, but
Williams and Johnson look better, and Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, the
other two freshmen WRs, aren't too far behind. Defensive coordinator Carl
Reese also says freshman CB Nathan Vasher and freshman DE Kalen Thornton
will
play Saturday.
RECRUITING NOTES: Greg Barnum, the center from Killeen Ellison who left
Tennesse and considered transferring to Texas, enrolled at Stephen F.
Austin
and says he plans to stay there for the remainder of his career. . . DE
Eric
Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., says he is still planning to take his official
visit to Texas this weekend, and super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison
heads the list of high school stars who plan to come to the UT game on
unofficial visits. . . Shreveport Evangel's 60-game winning streak ended
Saturday when Marrero Shaw took a 22-19 victory. Evangel QB Brett Rawls,
6-5,
200, completed 19 of 37 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns in a
losing
effort. Rawls and Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, of Dallas Bishop Lynch, are UT's
top QB targets this recruiting season.
BASKETBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorn women got a commitment Monday
from
the state's top prospect, Heather Schrieber, a  6-2 forward from
Windthrost,
a small town near Wichita Falls. Schrieber, who had offers from top schools
all over the country after a great summer season in AAU ball, had narrowed
her choices to Texas and Iowa State, and she visited the Cyclones last
weekend, then came home and called the Texas coaches to say she wants to
play
for the Longhorns. "I just really like Texas," she said. Joel Nelson of
Flower Mound, who coached her in AAU play this summer, said, "Heather is a
great player. She can bring the ball down court, she hit 46% of her
three-pointers for us and she was the best player on an AAU team that
finished fourth in the country. She could play guard, forward or center at
the college level and be very good at any of those positions. I know teams
like Texas Tech, Arkansas, Iowa State and several others wanted her, too. I
think she's the best player in the state." He said she averaged 18 points,
13
rebounds and 6 assists in a 60-game AAU season against top players from 4A
and 5A schools.
