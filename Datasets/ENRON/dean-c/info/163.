Roy Williams Leads Outstanding Freshman Class in Workouts
The heralded Longhorn freshman class had its first two workouts Monday, and
several players looked very good, but big, fast WR Roy Williams was almost
too impressive to believe.
He's big, at about 6-3 or maybe 6-4 and a little over 200 pounds (we should
get official heights and weights Tuesday) and he is fast (10.03 100 meters
last track season) and no one could cover him Monday. He caught so many
long
passes I lost count.
Pitty poor Nathan Vasher, the lone scholarship DB among the freshmen. He
had
to try to cover Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, the
best group of freshman wide receivers in the country. As soon as he got
through with one and got a little breather, it was on to the next one.
Vasher
actually did a good job most of the time on everybody except Williams, who
was just too big and too strong for him to handle. Vasher does a good job
of
man coverage, getting right with the wide receiver and staying with him on
most occasions.
Also pity poor QB Chance Mock, who probably threw more passes Monday than
he
did in his whole career at The Woodlands. He showed great accuracy and
touch
on long and short passes, and offensive coordinator Greg Davis,
complimented
him for having "a quick release." But I'll bet his arm is sore Tuesday.
Coach Mack Brown said he doesn't normally want to play freshmen,
particularly
early in the season, but he said it is easier for wide receivers to play
early than for most other players.
"Take our two freshmen defensive ends, Kalen Thornon and Adam Doiron,"
Brown
said. "They are very good prospects, but they have never lined up against
anybody like Leonard Davis, and that's what they'll start doing when the
veterans show up. Their learning curve goes up pretty drastically, and they
probably will need some time to cope with that."
But he said it's a different story with wide receivers. "If a receiver can
run, jump, catch and do something after he catches it, Brown said, "we can
make the offense simpler for him,"
Darryl Drake, the wide receiver coach, phrased it another way, saying, "If
a
guy is 6-3 or 6-4, can run close to a 10-flat hundred meters and high jump
seven feet (Williams did all that last year at Odessa Permian), we'll just
tell him to run down the field and, if anybody can keep up with him,
they're
probably short cornerbacks and he can outjump them for the ball. We'll
coach
him next year, but he can get by with the speed and jumping ability this
year." Drake was only partially kidding.
When Williams has to try to get off the line against big-time correrbacks
like Quentin Jammer and Roderick Babers, the two UT starters, it will be
harder, but Brown said all the receivers are going to get a lot of work
against bump-and-run coverage. He also said he expects at least two of them
to play a lot early in the season;
Thomas, Johnson and Jeffery also had some good plays. Thomas made one great
catch of a high ball that appeared to be out of his reach.
One UT assistant coach told me today he has never seen back-to-back classes
as outstanding as the two the Longhorns have put together the last two
years.
The freshmen will have their final workouts as a group Tuesday. The varsity
reports Wednesday and the first full team workouts will be Friday.

RECRUITING NOTES: The news got as little better today on the state's best
quarterback, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas Bishop Lynch. He
visited Colorado unofficially last weekend and came back very impressed and
saying he wants to delay his decision on picking a college.
But he told me today the Longhorn coaches are recruiting two quarterbacks
(Bret Rawls of Louisiana powerhouse Shreveport Evangel is the other one)
"and
they gave us both a deadline of October 15 and told us to look around and
be
sure what we want to do. I think that is a real sign of class," he said.
"I'll probably take some official visits before that, maybe to Colorado,
Kansas, LSU and Tennessee, and then I'll take an official visit to Texas. I
still say Texas will be hard to beat, but I just want to be real sure
before
I make a decision."
