Longhorns Getting Thinner at TE; Fall Signings Impressive

Coach Mack Brown said Wednesday TE Brock Edwards is questionable for the
Kansas game because his sore calf felt worse Wednesday than it did earlier
in
the week. As it stands now, he said Chad Stevens will start against Kansas
Saturday.
The Longhorns have had an incredible run of bad luck at TE. First, budding
star Bo Scaife tore an ACL on the first day of pre-season workouts. That
moved Mike Jones into the starting lineup and he, too, tore an ACL,
although
he did get to play in six games before incurring the injury. That moved
true
freshman Edwards, the only remaining scholarship TE, into the starting
lineup.
Stevens, a high school TE, had been moved to FB, but has moved back to TE
full time.
It was cold and rainy Tuesday and Wednesday in Austin and Brown said he was
happy about it because there is a very good chance it will be cold and
rainy
Saturday in Lawrence.

The Longhorns cleaned up on the first day of the fall signing period
Wednesday.
BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Point guard T.J. Ford, 5-11, 165, of Sugar
Land
Willowridge, and center Chris Wright, 6-10, 235, of Redwater, signed
basketball letters of intent with Texas Wednesday, the first day of the
fall
signing period.
Coach Rick Barnes said Ford is ranked as the nation's top point guard by
Bob
Gibbons' All-Star  Report and Wright is rated as the No. 25 prospect in the
country by Gibbons.
For those of you who like to keep up with future prospects, 6-7 Louisiana
star Derek Burditt of Marrero Ehret is the cousin of former Longhorn star
Albert Burditt. He is one of the nation's top juniors. The next great
player
in Texas might be 6-8 sophomore Kendrick Perkins of Beaumont Ozen. The
Longhorns are recruiting both these underclassmen.
