Note to E-Mail Subscribers:

I published a roster in the mail version of my newsletter. If you have the UT
media guide (the big, back-breaking thing) or if you went to the first game
and got a program, you already have it. I have a lot of out-of-state
subscribers and I always try to publish the roster so they can tell who is
who when they watch it on television.

But I had to use a copy. It isn't in my computer, so I can't e-mail it to
you. If you don't have the media guide and didn't come to the first game,
then you probably will want it.

I can fax it to you if send me a fax no. or I can mail you a copy if you will
send me a self-addressed envelope.

FB Games Available on Tape
Many of you have asked me how to get the football season videotape package

This is a great product. I endorse it heartily because it contains pre-game,
half-time and post-game remarks from Mack Brown, plus every play, and you can
watch it in less than an hour because it cuts out all the idle time.

Network radio broadcast, post game interviews, sideline footage and more.
Bonus tape: the Big 12 Championship game if Texas is a participant, free

Football Notes . .
Dan Smith, the junior college transfer who handled the kickoff duties against
New Mexico State, is from Charles City, Iowa, and Waldforf JC in Iowa. He was
booting them out of the end zone in pre-game drills, but tailed off slightly
in the game. The coaches like his leg strength and the height he gets on his
kicks. He wears No. 33.
* * * *
The guy who used to wear No. 33 is junior RB Kenny Hayter. He has transferred
to TCU and will have two season to play after sitting out this year to
establish his eligibility.
* * * *
Freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum of Mesquite was named the Big 12
Conference Special Teams Player of the Week after setting a UT freshman debut
scoring record for a kicker with 11 points. He was 2-for-2 on field goals and
5-for-5 on extra points. His two field goals also tied Jeff Ward's 1983
freshman debut record in that category.
* * * *
True freshmen who played Saturday, in addition to Mangum, were RB Cedric
Benson, LBs Derrick Johnson and Aurmon Satchell and WR Brian Carter. Satchell
enrolled in January after signing last year. Coach Mack Brown said unless a
rash of injuries changes his plans, all of the other freshmen except possibly
one defensive back will redshirt.
* * * *
The Longhorns have won nine straight games in Royal Memorial Stadium. That is
their longest home winning streak since 1984.
* * * *
The coaches named OLs Mike Williams and Antwan Kirk-Hughes the outstanding
offensive players, LB Everick Rawls, CB Rod Babers and DE Kalen Thornton the
outstanding defensive performers and safety Phillip Geiggar the top special
team player in the season opener.
