Why did we give Matt McFarland a scholarship if he isn't a capable kicker?

> The Longhorns were already thin at defensive end, and they could be

> 250-pound junior, underwent surgery Friday to repair what UT officials
> called
> "significant damage to muscles and tendons in his right arm."
> UT head football trainer Tom McVan said the surgeons who operated on
> McClintock said the injury appeared to be caused by a glass cut, probably

> from a broken window. They said McClintock was injured in an eaccident at
> a
> family member's home.
> "O. J.'s surgery was successful," McVan said. "Our medical staff and the

> "It's very unfortunate that O. J. was injured," said head coach Mack
> Brown.
> "He did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end (from
> linebacker) in the spring and is a guy we have high hopes for this
> season."
> If McClintock's injury is serious enough to cause him to miss all or part

coaches
>
> will move one or more players to defensive end to provide more depth.
> Incoming freshman Eric Hall, who had been ticketed for a try at fullback,

> would be a good candidate for a switch to defensive end.
> McClintock, a junior, has never redshirted, so he could sit out the year
> without penalty if the injuury turns out to be serious.
> He is expected to be released from the hospital Saturday.
