> Brown Says Benson Might Start Saturday at Oklahoma State
>
> Coach Mack Brown said Thursday freshman RB Cedric Benson "has had a good
> week
> of practice and we'll make a decision at gametime on whether he or Ivan
> (Williams) will start."
> Benson has run with the first team in practice all week after making only
> a
> cameo appearance in the loss to Oklahoma Saturday, and Brown said the
> coaches
> plan to use him more for the rest of the season.
> Benson has great acceleration through the line of scrimmage and the
> Longhorn
> offensive linemen can usually open a hole briefly against a good defense.
> He
> has a much better chance of getting through a small hole than the
> 240-pound
> Williams, who requires a step or two to get much acceleration.
> Brown also said DE Kaelen Thornton (sprained knee) and TB Victor Ike
> (bruised
> ribs) have not been able to practice this week and won't make the trip to

> Stillwater this weekend. He said DT Maurice Gordon, a former DE, will
move
>
> back to end at start in Thornton's place and he said sophomore DT Adam
> Doiron
> will start at tackle when Texas is in its base 4-3 defense.
> The Longhorns might return to a 4-3 at times against Oklahoma State
> Saturday,
> and they probably will use it a lot next week when a power-running
> Colorado
> team comes to Austin, but they have used a 3-4 most of the time in their
> last
> two games against pass oriented Oklahoma and Texas Tech.
> Brown said earlier in the week that several starters on offense were in
> danger of losing their jobs, but he softened that statement a little
> Thursday, saying, "We may rotate three guards and Derrick Dockery might
> play
> a little more at tackle and Jason Glynn might play a little more."
> What that means is a probable three-way rotation at guard between
Dockery,
>
> Antwan Kirk-Hughes and Tillmon Holloway, with Dockery sliding out to
> tackle
> to replace Robbie Doane at times, and a two-way rotation at center with
> Matt
> Anderson and Glynn splitting time.
> Brown also said the team has been practicing hard this week and trying to
> put
> the tough loss to Oklahoma behind them.
> "The fans don't have to get ready until Saturday," he said, "but the
> coaches
> and players have to start getting ready on Monday."
> Brown also was asked about a story in Thursday's Fort Worth Star Telegram

> alleging he telephoned the prosecutor in a sexual misconduct suit against

> former Shreveport Evangel head coach Dennis Dunn and offered to be a
> character witness for Dunn. A minor girl in Marshall has accused Dunn of
> improper sexual conduct.
> Brown said he would have only one comment on that and that comment was:
"I
>
> would be happy to be a character witness for Dennis Dunn, who has been a
> friend of mind for more than 20 years."

of

> Lindale, who is so fast he plays wide receiver on offense. Williams, who

> Oklahoma, Texas A&M, Baylor, Minnesota and West Virginia. He also told me
