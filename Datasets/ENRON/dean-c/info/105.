1. Texas is still recruiting Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. I
listed him in my out-of-state prospects, but inadvertantly omitted him in the
article when I was writing about guys UT is still recruiting.

2. Marquis Johnson did make it to Austin, but didn't meet with any coaches. I
talked to him mother last night and she said he never got to Austin, but I
checked with Marquis today and he said he drove to Austin and looked around
and like what he saw, but did not meet with any coaches.
