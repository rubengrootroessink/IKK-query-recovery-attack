> The Longhorns are favored by 20 points for their 1 p.m. game Saturday at

will

> But the road game at Baylor the following week has been set for an 11:30

> The first Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were announced Monday

> Texas was ranked No. 6 behind five teams with perfect records. The BCS

> Michigan at 15.91, Maryland at 21.29, Tennessee at 22.07 and Washington

> at 23.05 to round out the top 10.
> One of the top two will drop this week because OU and Nebraska meet in

> Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are
> guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose,
> Orange,
> Fiesta and Sugar. The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this

> If Texas wins out, the Longhorns probably will wind up in New Orleans in

> This
