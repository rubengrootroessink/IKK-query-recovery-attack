> UT Recruits Look Good in North-South Game
>
> The Longhorns had eight recruits in the annual North-South game in Fort
> Worth
> Tuesday night, and they all looked good at times. One of the UT recruits,
> DB
> Huston Street of Austin Westlake, is coming to Texas to play baseball
> instead
> of football.
> But the seven future Longhorn football players, headed by QB Kendal
Briles
> of
> Wolfforth Frenship (who will be a DB at Texas), S Rufus Harris of La
Porte
>
> and OG Mike Garcia, were among the stars in the game, which resulted in a

> 16-9 victory for the North.
> The game was a total defensive struggle until halfway through the fourth
> quarter. The South was leading, 6-2, at that point. But Briles scrambled
> 20
> yards to make a key first down, then hit a 9-yard touchdown pass to put
> the
> North on top, 9-6. The South came back with another field goal to tie it,
> but
> the North got a long touchdown pass in the final seconds to win.
> Harris was one of the game's big hitters in the secondary for the South.
> He
> made a thunderous hit early in the game.  Garcia also did a good job of
> blocking for the South.
> OT William Winston of Houston Madison teamed with Garcia to provide good
> pass
> and run blocking for the South.
> Future Longhorns joining Briles on the victorious North squad were OT
Will
>
> Allen of Cypress Falls, WR-CB Aaron Ross of  Tyler (he'll be a CB at
> Texas),
> and speedy DB Michael Huff of Irving Nimitz.
> The teams were sloppy at times because they had less than a week of
> practice
> and that always makes for mistakes, penalties and inconsistent play. But
> all
> of the future Longhorns produced some highlights along the way.
> Texas had more signees in the game than any other school. Super RB Cedric

> Benson of Midland Lee also was invited, but passed it up to continue
> working
> out in Austin to be ready to challenge for playing time at UT as a true
> freshman.
> The Aggies had six, including 6-3, 235-pound DE Brandon Johnson of Bryan,
> who
> was the Defensive Player of the Game. Johnson showed great pass-rushing
> skills for the North.

> Junior DE O. J. McClintock says the doctors have told him he can resume
