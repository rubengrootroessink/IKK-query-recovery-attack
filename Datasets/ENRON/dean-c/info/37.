Game Quotes . .

"Texas has great team speed. That return guy (Nathan Vasher) was spectacular,
just spectacular. He was the back-breaker for us. There is no doubt about it
- he was the difference in the ball game in my opinion. We were in the game
and had some momentum, and then he started running those punts back down our
throat. Mack Brown has done a great job at Texas. They really have some
outstanding athletes."
- North Carolina head coach John Bunting
* * * *
"It seemed like everyone was hitting their blocks on my returns, so usually I
just had to try to make one guy miss. It was a lot of fun. Now, I just have
to get back to work to try to get better."
- UT safety/punt returner Nathan Vasher
* * * *
"It's great to put (freshman LB Derrick Johnson) in pass-rush situations
because he's got some shake and bake the Good Lord gave him. He's still
learning what to do, and by mid-season I think he'll really make a mark. He's
already made a little bit of a mark in my mind."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I just read the quarterback's eyes. When I got the ball, I ran as hard as I
could and then I jumped as high as I could. I was not going to be denied. I
wanted that touchdown."
- UT DE Cory Redding, talking about his 22-yard interception return for the
game's first score
* * * *
"I was really excited about getting to play against him (heralded North
Carolina DE Julius Peppers). He's got a great first step and he's really
fast. He's got real long arms, too, which helps him on  his pass rush. I felt
like I did pretty good. I know I gave it all I had and played as hard as I
could on every play. I got some help from other guys a lot of the time."
- Longhorn OT Robbie Doane, who was primarily responsible for holding Peppers
without a tackle or a sack
* * * *
"I questioned myself a little on that one just before the half. It was 49
yards and going into the wind, but I marked off my steps, took a deep breath
and told myself to kick right through the ball and drive it. I was really
excited when it went in. It gave the team a lift."
- Texas true freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum, who booted a 49-yard field
goal into the wind on the last play of the first half to give Texas a 20-14
lead at intermission.
* * * *
"Our defense was unbelievable. They kept us in the game and then the special
teams kind of drove the dagger in their heart. Nathan Vasher is great. He got
the whole team and everybody in the stands excited."
- UT QB Chris Simms

Scouting Houston

The Longhorns have an open date this week, and then they hit the road for the
first time this year and travel to Houston to play the Cougars at 8 p.m. on
September 22 in tiny Robertson Stadium.
The Cougars lost to cross-town rival Rice, 21-14, in their season opener and
had their open date last week. Things won't get any easier for them this week
because they travel to Athens to play the Georgia Bulldogs.
The Owls controlled the ball and the clock against Houston, rolling up 354
yards with their wishbone attack.
So, if the Longhorns are ever going to get their running game going, they
won't have a better opportunity all season.
Against Rice, Houston had only 199 yards offensively, and 192 of that was
through the air. So it looks like the Cougars can't run and can't stop the
run.
QB Kelly Robertson is UH's main offensive threat and his top target is WR
Brian Robinson, while the defense is led by CB Jason Parker.
The Cougars went 3-8 a year ago in coach Dana Dimel's first year. They have
eight returning starters on offense and six on defense.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Longhorn Notes . .

 Sophomore Nathan Vasher broke Johnny Johnson's school record for single-game
punt return yardage with 153 yards on eight returns. Johnson gained 131 yards
against Boston College in 1977. Vasher's 44-yard touchdown return in the
fourth quarter broke a long dry spell. It was the first for the Longhorns
since Mike Adams ran one back in 1993, a mere 98 games ago. ... Backup
quarterback Major Applewhite got into the game late in the fourth quarter,
but he added to his list of records with two pass attempts to overtake Peter
Gardere in the category. Applewhite has now thrown 1,025 passes, and holds or
is tied for 41 school records.. . . North Carolina had only 52 net yards and
made only two first downs in the second half, both in the fourth quarter. . .
The Tar Heels dominated time of possession in the first half, holding the
ball for 18:02 compared to the Longhorns 11;58, but Texas had the ball for
more than 20 minutes of the 30-minute second half (20:08 to 9:52).

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska thumped Notre Dame, 27-10, at home, and Kansas State whipped USC,
10-6, on the road  in top intersectional games involving Big 12 teams last
week.
It was a great week overall for the Big 12 because league teams won 11 games,
with Kansas losing to UCLA for the only blemish.

Baseball Team Gets 2 Pledges

 The Longhorn baseball team got commitments Sunday from two of the state's
top players.
Andrew Casares, 6-3, 217, a switch-hitting outfielder who batted .431 and hit
eight home runs as a junior at Corpus Christi Carroll, chose Texas over Rice,
Houston, Oklahoma State and others. Carroll went 29-4 last season.
He also led the Ohio Thunder, an AAU team, in hitting last summer with a .424
average and five home runs.
J. Brent Cox, 6-3, 195, a right-handed pitcher who went 9-2 last year as a
junior at Bay City, picked the Horns over Arizona State, Miami, Rice,
Nebraska, Baylor and others.
Cox has an outstanding slider, a fast ball in the 88-90 mph range and fine
control. He gave up an average of four hits and two walks per game while
striking out about 10 per game.

Basketball Recruiting

One of the top basketball recruits in the nation is  Brad Buckman, a 6-8
power forward at Austin Westlake, and he is strongly considering the Longhorns
.
His father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams (1971 &
1972) at Texas with Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite. His mother, Tammy, also is a
Texas grad.
Buckman, who had a great summer in AAU basketball, has narrowed his choices
to Texas, Kansas, UCLA and North Carolina.
Buckman is ranked as a national top 50 recruit.
There also are three nationally-ranked guards in Texas this year, but the
Longhorns lost out on all three of them.
The best of the bunch, Bracey Wright of  The Colony, picked Indiana last
week, Brian Hopkins of  Dallas Lincoln chose SMU over Texas Wednesday, and
Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill picked Michigan several weeks ago.
