> Brown Says 3 or 4 Offensive Starters in Danger of Losing Their Jobs
>
> Coach Mack Brown said Tuesday three or four offensive starters have been
> told
> they are in danger of losing their jobs unless they really show some
> improvement and some fire in practice this week.
> He declined to identify them, but he made it clear QB Chris Simms is not
> one
> of the starters he was referring to in his statement. I'm sure one of the

> guys who was warned was TB Ivan Williams, who ran pretty tentatively at
> times
> against Oklahoma, and it is safe to say a couple of offensive linemen
> probably got the warning, too.
> Brown said, "We told them we are going to make them compete this week to
> keep
> their starting jobs. We're going to watch them and grade them and we'll
> tell
> them on Friday if they are still starting. It all depends on their
> attitude
> and how they compete in practice this week. We've got to get better
> offensively and it starts with practice this week."
> The Longhorns are seeing a steady diet of zone pass coverages and that is

> happening everywhere. UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese is a strong
> advocate of man-for-man defense, but he is using mostly zone coverages
> this
> year because it helps eliminate the long touchdown passes. That's why
> everyone is using it.
> Brown said the Longhorns are going to have to run the ball better to be
> able
> to be effective offensively against the great defensive teams, and he
said
> he
> has told the coaches and the players that the running game must get
> better.
> He also said freshman RB Cedric Benson, who did not carry the ball
against
>
> OU, will be used much more in the coming weeks.
> He said the Longhorns also are going to have to rely more on short passes
> and
> utilize TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards more to try to defeat the zone
> coverages.

> The Longhorns are a 17-point favorite over Oklahoma State for their 11:30

> The Texas-Colorado game in Austin the following week also will be

> but ABC, which gets first choice each week, gets to exercise a 6-day
> window
> on choosing games three times a year and it has decided to use one those
> options that weekend. That means the game probably will be on ABC at 2:30

> p.m. on October 20 if Texas beats Oklahoma State and Colorado beats Texas
> A&M
> this weekend. If either Texas or Colorado lose, then it probably will be
> the
> Fox national game at 6 p.m., but it could be the Fox regional game at
> 11:30
> a.m. If that sounds confusing, it's because the whole TV thing is

> RECRUITING NOTES:  DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, who says he had eight
> sacks
> in his most recent game to give him 14 for the season, says Texas and
> Oklahoma are his top two teams. He also said the fact that OU beat Texas
> won't be a factor in his decision. With an SAT score in the 1,200 range,
> he
> would feel a lot more at home at Texas than he would at OU. I like UT's
> chances with him. He is a great player who combines great size and
> strength
> with tremendous quickness. . . DT Marco Martin of Mesquite is having a
> great
> year. He has always been a great prospect because he can run in the 4.7
> range
> while weighing over 300 pounds, but he has been inconsistent in the past.

> That's not the case this year because he is playing dominating football.
> He
> lists Texas No. 1, but says he plans to take several visits before making
> a
> college choice. . . The loss to OU doesn't seem to have hurt Texas any in

> recruiting. I've talked to most of the top players who went to the game
> and
> they say the outcome won't influence them.

> BASEBALL RECRUITING: The Longhorns got commitments Tuesday from two top

White
