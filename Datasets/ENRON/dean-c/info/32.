has

> Sunday or Monday.

> Texas is Number 1. I've been hearing from Oklahoma fans and it hasn't

coaches

> WR Montrell Flowers has had to give up football. Head coach Mack Brown
> said
> Tuesday Flowers suffered some kidney injuries when he took a hard like in

> Saturday's game. He said doctors discovered he only has one kidney and
> advised him to give up football. Brown said he will get a medical

> concentrate
> on track, where he has two years of eligiblity left.
> "Montrell's injury is really unfortunate," Brown said. "He is a nice kid
> who
> was playing his best football and providing much needed veteran
leadership
>
> for us."
> Brown also announced that backup kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell has quit
> the
> team to "concentrate on personal matters." The personal matters are a
> Monday
> grand jury indictment in Dallas County on a felony charge of taking and
> distributing nude photographs of a 17-year-old Coppell girl.
> McFadden, a redshirt freshman at Texas, was expected to be the starting
> place
> kicker at Texas this season, but he had a disappointing spring and the
> coaches brought in four freshmen walk-on kickers in August. One of them,
> Dusty Mangum of  Mesquite, beat him out and has been sensational so far.
> Mangum is perfect on all five of his field goal tries, including one from
> 51
> yards and another from 49 yards into a swirling wind.
> Mangum probably will get McFadden's scholarship at the end of this
> semester.
> Brown also said DE O. J. McClintock, who has been out all season with
> severe
> cuts to his right hand and arm, returned to practice this week, "and we
> just
> have to wait and see how he does." With the open date this weekend, there
> is
> a chance he might be back for the Houston game on Sept. 22.
> Brown cut Tuesday's workout short because of the tragic terrorist
bombings
> in
> New York and Washington and said the coaches and the players are all
upset
>
> about "this tragic day."
> "This is a very difficult day for all Americans," he said. "Our thoughts

guards
