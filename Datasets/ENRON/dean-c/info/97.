> Longhorn Veterans Report; Ellis, Wyndham Only Players Missing
>
> Senior linebacker Jon Wyndham and sophomore tight end Artie Ellis were
the
>
> only Longhorn veterans missing Thursday when the other 60 scholarship
> varsity
> players reported to begin pre-season practice.
> Head coach Mack Brown  said Wyndham, a senior who has played primarily on

> special teams during his career, did not report with the team due to
> unresolved medical issues that are unrelated to football.  He said the
> medical issues might cause Wyndham to miss the fall semester. He did not
> elaborate.
> He said Ellis,  who played in seven games and caught eight passes for 77
> yards as a receiver last year, is taking the fall semester off for
> personal
> reasons and to further recover from a stress fracture in his tibia.  That

> injury limited his action in 2000 and sidelined him during spring drills.
> He
> moved to tight end last spring and Brown said the coaches expect him to
> return in January for the spring semester.
> Wyndham is not expected to return to the team. "I really want to be with
> my
> teammates and help the program," he said, "but I need to take care of
> myself
> first.  I came here to play football and get an education and even if I
> don't
> play again, I want to leave here with a degree."
> "I'd like to thank my coaches and teammates for all their support," Ellis

> said, "but it is in my best interest at this time to take care of my
> personal
> issues and to further recover from my stress fracture. I wish the
> Longhorns
> the best of luck this season and look forward to coming back strong next
> January."
> The veterans joined the freshmen for a team meeting  Thursday night and
> both
> groups will go through orientation Friday before their first full team
> workout at 9 a.m. Saturday at Frank Denius Field at the corner of 26th
> Street
> and Red River.
> "Obviously this group of veterans is excited to get things started,"
Brown
>
> said.  "A lot of them have been here all summer and several of the guys
> have
> been out at the freshmen workouts the past  two days.  But, today's
> reporting
> day is what we have been waiting  for since the spring game.  With a
> couple
> of exceptions, we now have  everyone here.  The guys have tomorrow off to

> focus on academics and  to get acquainted with the newcomers and then
> we'll
> get down to  business on the field Saturday."

> Coach Brown also reset Sunday's practice for 3:30 p.m. He had said

> he would move it to the early morning, but he said Thursday he decided to

> keep in it the afternoon because the team's second workout Saturday will
> be
> at 7 p.m., and he said he thought the players needed more rest before the

> Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Pickryl, one of the nation's top
> pass-rushing ends, took an unofficial visit to OU last week and came away

> saying Texas, UCLA and Missouri are his top three teams at this point.
> Pittman says his top two teams are Texas and LSU, and Studdard is a
strong

in
