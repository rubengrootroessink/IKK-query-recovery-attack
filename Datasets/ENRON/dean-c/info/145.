Tommie Harris, DL, 6-3, 275, 4.75, Killeen Ellison, Texas

"I really go after it. I'm aggressive and I'm really strong," said Harris,
who bench presses 405 pounds. "I'm just blessed. That's all I can really
say." College coaches agree. Said one recruiting coordinator, "When you are
thinking about the best defensive linemen in the state of Texas, just draw
a
line under Tommie Harris. He is clearly the best defensive lineman in the
state. He is the only great one."

Last season, this 57-foot shot-putter had 139 tackles, including 21 for
losses and eight sacks. Tommie, whose father is in the Army, was born in
Germany but has lived in the United States since 1991.

He strongly favors TEXAS, which is 45 minutes from his home. "Mack Brown is
gonna do some good there. They are a team on the rise. I feel at home there
and there is no school with better facilities. They have a great weight
program. There is a 75 percent chance I'll choose TEXAS."

Others in the running are MIAMI ("I like their attack defense. I always
liked Warren Sapp. He's great. I don't know much about them, but my family
is from Pompano Beach and I still have family there."), TEXAS A&M, FLORIDA
STATE ("When I was a kid, I always used to watch them. Bobby Bowden looks
like he knows what he is doing.") and LSU.
