Horns Compete at NCAA Track

University of Texas senior Chris Hercules finished second in the triple jump
and sophomore Moushaumi Robinson placed third in the 400 meters and helped
UT's 1,600-meter relay finish second at the 2001 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships in Eugene, Oregon in early June.
 The Texas women finished 10th in the team standings with 25 points,
extending their streak of top-10 finishes under head coach Beverly Kearney to
eight consecutive years.
The Longhorn men finished 15th with 19 points, marking the program's sixth
top-15 finish in head coach Bubba Thornton's six-year tenure.
In the meet's final event, Robinson anchored UT's 1,600-meter relay to a
runner-up finish for the second consecutive year in 3:30.36. She was joined
on the relay by freshman Alyssa Aiken, senior Angel Patterson and freshman
Raasin McIntosh.
Senior Nicole Hoxie and sophomore Jermaine Cooper both picked up their first
individual All-America honors in their respective hurdle events.
Hoxie closed her Longhorn career by finishing sixth in the 100-meter hurdles
in 13.08, marking her fourth All-America performance overall.
In the 110-meter hurdles, Cooper picked up his first All-America certificate
by finishing fourth in 13.97.
Sophomore Erin Sims picked up her first All-America honor by finishing
seventh in the 1,500-meter final. Sims ran 4:22.98.
Patterson finished third in the 400-meter hurdles in 56.45.
The Texas men scored in the 400-meter relay for the first time since 1988
with their seventh-place effort. The crew of junior Amar Johnson, senior
Lawrence Armstrong, junior Michael Franklin  and junior Nathanael Esprit ran
a 40.05.
Freshman Dylan Armstrong broke his school record and became the first
Longhorn ever to earn All-America honors in the hammer throw when he finished
fifth with a toss of 227-11, topping his prior record of 227-4 set at the
Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays on April 5. He now owns the top five throws in
school history.
Thornton and Kearney both say they expect their teams to be better next year.
Both say they are awaiting some signed letters of intent, but say they have
some recruits who will help their teams.
Thornton also has an outstanding transfer in Tre Gardner, a sprinter-long
jumper who started out at Baylor.

Basketball Star Evans Turns Pro

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has hired an agent, thus
forfeiting his senior year of college eligibility.
Evans  led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average.
He said he is ready to give the NBA a try.

Barnes Hires Top Recruiter

Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes has hired South Carolina assistant
coach Frank Haith, 35, as his top assistant.
Haith has a reputation as an outstanding recruiter.
Haith, who went with coach Dave Odom to South Carolina in April after
assisting Odom for the last four years at Wake Forest, takes the job vacated
by Rob Lanier, who resigned to become head coach at Siena College.
While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons to
four consecutive post-season tournament appearances, including an NCAA bert
last season.
He also was instrumental in helping Wake Forest sign one of the nation's Top
10 recruiting classes during the 1999-2000 campaign.
"In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the
nation," Barnes said.
"He came very highly recommended from many of the high school coaches in the
state of Texas and around the nation. Frank also brings a great deal of
familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this area of the country. There
is no question that it is just a matter of time before he becomes a head
coach at this level."
Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the
associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97). He spent one season (1995-96) as
an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a 21-7 overall
record.
But Barnes is still coach hunting because Ed Kohtala, who has been one of his
assistants  since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago, has been named head
coach at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. He is expected to name a replacement
in the next couple of weeks.

Assistant Golf Coach Named

UT head golf coach Susan Watkins has hired Shannon Fisher, a former TCU star,
as one of her assistant coaches
Fisher was a four-year letterwinner at TCU (1995-1999), where she led the
Horned Frogs to two appearances at the NCAA Championships in 1997 and 1999.
She is currently ranked 18th on TCU's Top 20 career scoring list with a
scoring average of 77.90 in 127 rounds played.
For the past year, Fisher, a native of Austin, has taught golf professionally
at the Austin Golf Club, where she served as the office manager and assistant
golf professional.
In 1999, she earned exempt status to compete on the SBC Futures Professional
Golf Tour.
"Shannon brings a new dynamic to our team," said Watkins, who led the
Longhorns to consecutive third-place showings at the last two NCAA
Championships. "She is a great teacher of the game and has a strong knowledge
of the top players in Texas."

Stephens Vying for Star Team

UT sophomore-to-be Stacy Stephens is one of 30 top players aged
19-and-younger competing at the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team
Trials in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Following the four-day trials, which end Monday, 12 players will be selected
for the 2001 USA Women's Junior World Championship Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was the first Longhorn freshman in 20 years
- and only the second rookie ever - to lead the 20-13  Longhorn squad in
both scoring (11 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg).
In Big 12 Conference action, she averaged 10.9 points and 10.3 rebounds per
league game and was one of only three league players to average a
double-double in both scoring and rebounding.
In addition to her All-Big 12 honors, Stephens was named to the 2000-01
Women's Basketball News Service National All-Freshman Second Team and was
tabbed the Big 12 Freshman of the Year by both the Dallas Morning News and
the Austin American Statesman.
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are having their elite summer camp this
weekend and Chelsi Welch, the 5-9 sharpshooter who led Plainview to the state
Class 4A championship last spring, says she plans to come to the camp. One of
the state's top underclass players, 6-3 Tiffany Jackson, a junior to be at
Dallas Lincoln, also says she will be there. Four out-of-state girls who
range from 6-3 to 6-4 1/2, also are scheduled to attend. UT's biggest need in
its next recruiting class is a shooting guard and a big center.

A "Must Read" For All UT Exes!
The Burnt Orange Coffin
(Los Muertos No Hablan)
By Bill Holchak  BJ '49
It's recruit signing day, and the greatest high school player in the history
of Texas football is scheduled to make his official commitment to play for
the Burnt Orange. But the expected celebration at the UT  Ex-Students Center
in Austin turns into a wake when it is learned that the boy and his father
have been found murdered at their remote ranch home near the
headwaters of the Frio and Nueces Rivers in south Texas. Millionaire
playboy/detective Bill Chak volunteers his services without charge to his
alma mater to solve the mystery, and finds out that the trail soon leads far
beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.

Horns Sign Top JC Guard

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes has signed 6-4 point guard Terrell Ross of
Allegany  JC in Cumberland, Maryland. Ross will have two years of eligibility
with the Longhorns.
"Terrell is a versatile player with good size who can help our backcourt play
in many ways," Barnes said.  "He handles the ball and sees the floor well,
can score and defend, and is a good worker."
"The most attractive thing about Terrell is that he comes from one of the
most storied junior college programs in the nation and received great
coaching while at Allegany," Barnes said.
Ross was the starting point guard for two years under coach Bob Kirk at
Allegany and he averaged 9.3 points, 7.7 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game
while earning first-team NJCAA (National Junior College Athletic Association)
Division I All-America and first-team All-Region XX honors during his
sophomore season.
He led the Trojans to a 32-3 record and a runner-up finish at the NJCAA
Division I Championship last season.
Ross converted 52.2% of his field goals, 33.8% (20-of-59) from three-point
range and he hit 74.3% (81-of-109) from the free throw line as a sophomore.
He joins fall signees T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and Chris Wright of
Redwater. Ford is a 5-11 point guard and Wright is a 6-10 center.
