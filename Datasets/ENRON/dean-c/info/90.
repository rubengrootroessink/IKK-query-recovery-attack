> Brown Says Benson "Even Better Than We Thought He Was"
>
> Texas coach Mack Brown has been cautious about putting extra pressure on
> RB
> Cedric Benson, but he apparently has discovered  the heralded freshman
can
>
> handle it because he had lots of praise for him Sunday during the team's
> annual media day.
> With reporters from several other Big 12 cities in the audience, Brown
> said,
> "Cedric Benson has a real flair with his vision, quick feet, power and
> determination. He's probably even better than we thought he was."
> And Brown and his staff thought Benson was so good last year when he led
> Midland Lee to its third straight Class 5A championship and scored five
> touchdowns in the title game for the third straight time that they made
> him
> their No. 1 recruiting priority.
> Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the Longhorns will go into the
> season
> with junior Victor Ike as the starting tailback, and sophomore Ivan
> Williams
> and Benson splitting time with him on about an equal basis.
> The Longhorn coaches have always stressed that their tailback must be
> adept
> at pass protection, but they haven't had a freshman with talent like
> Benson,
> and they appear ready to make some adjustments to get him on the field.
> Davis said Benson is behind Ike and Williams on pass protection because
he
>
> has only been in the UT system a few days. "But Cedric has great
> maturity,"
> Davis  said. "He has special talents and we will not let pass protection
> keep
> him from playing if he is the best back."
> West Texas football is pressure packed, particularly at the Class 5A
> level.
> When Benson scored five TDs in the state title game for the second year
in
> a
> row as a junior, it looked impossible for him to do it for a third time
> because Midland Lee's great offensive line graduated en masse. TE Eric
> Winston, a top recruit this year, did start some as a sophomore, but the
> other guys, from tackle to tackle, were all seniors.
> The coaches of other Class 5A powers knew all they had to do to beat
> Midland
> Lee was stop Cedric Benson because the Rebels had no other offensive
> weapons
> of note. With a green line, it seemed like a simple chore.
> The Rebels did lose a couple of early season games, but the line kept
> getting
> better week by week and he led them to a third straight title, scoring
> five
> TDs again as a senior, this time against a powerful Austin Westlake
> defense
> that had shut out two straight foes to get to the championship game.
> Excuse me for that history lesson, but Benson is a special kind of
running
>
> back, and the UT coaches, who already knew it, are not too shy now about
> saying it because he has already shown he's ready for big-time college
> football.
> Davis also said the Longhorns have a great group of receivers,
> particularly
> when the wide receivers and tight ends are lumped together as a group,
and
> he
> said QB Chris Simms gained much needed experience last year, "and he is
> much
> more mature this year. He has had a great camp and has shown he is much
> more
> mature and much stronger."
> He also said the offensive line will be much better this season because
> four
> of the five starters return and all of them are healthy for a change.
> Defensive coordinator Carl Reese says he is still looking for a defensive

> tackle, but he said the Longhorn defense "should be pretty good." Pretty
> good, by Reese's standards, means one that will rank in the top 10 again.
> He said Marcus Tubbs is solid at one tackle spot, and said Maurice
Gordon,
>
> Adam Doiron and Stevie Lee will all split time fairly equally until one
of
>
> them emerges as the starter at the other tackle spot.
> Reese said defensive ends Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding "are bigger and

> stronger and more determined this year." Since Thornton made the freshman

> All-America team last year after starting nine games as a true freshman
> and
> Redding is being touted as a pre-season All-Big 12 choice, that is bad
> news
