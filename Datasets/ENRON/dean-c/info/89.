> Monday, August 6 - Freshmen report
> Tuesday, August 7 - First freshman practice
> Thursday, August 9 - Varsity reports
> Saturday, August 11 - First full-team practice
> Sunday, August 12 - Team photo day, no practice
> Wednesday, August 15 - Afternoon practice will be first practice in full

> Saturday, August 18 - First scrimmage in Royal Memorial Stadium
> Sunday, August 19 - Media Day/Fan Appreciation Day 2-3:20 p.m.,
autographs

> 3:30-4:30 p.m.
> Thursday, August 23 - Scrimmage in Royal Memorial Stadium, 6 p.m.

> That is great news for the Longhorn offense for two reasons:

> 2. He and QB Chris Simms have great chemistry. If he had been healthy

of

> stud linebackers Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar and Aaron Harris of

> Mesquite. Some of you have asked me why Harris is so highly rated because

> the other guys. Folks, this guy is about as good as it gets at middle
> linebacker. He reads plays quickly, finds the ball and then delivers a
> king-kong-style lick. He is the real deal. Smith can run like a halfback
> and
> he hits hard, too. He is a tremendous outside linebacker prospect. I
think
