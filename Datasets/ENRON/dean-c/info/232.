Brown Says Horns Were Overrated in Early Season, But Now Playing Well

Coach Mack Brown said Wednesday the Longhorns were ranked too high to start
the season and didn't begin playing well until after the big loss to
Oklahoma, but he says they now have a good team and have a chance to go to
a
good bowl game.
Texas, now ranked No. 14, was No. 7 to start the season. "We were way too
over-rated in the pre-season," he said. "Alabama was third and their coach
got fired and they've won three games. The pre-season polls are way
overrated."
He said he didn't feel like the Longhorns played as a team early in the
season. "but the last five weeks, we have played as a team. We have matured
as a team."
The Longhorns will practice again  Thursday, then take off Friday, Saturday
and Sunday before returning to work Monday in preparation for the Friday
game
against A&M.

Brown said the players who were unable to practice Tuesday weren't able to
practice Wednesday. He said safety Greg Brown and TE Brock Edwards, both
battling leg injuries, are questionable for the Texas A&M game. He said QB
Major Applewhite is continuing to rehabilitate his knee sprain, and will be
re-evaluated Monday by the doctors.
Asked if he thinks Applewhite will be able to play against A&M, he said, "I
really don't have any idea until the doctors look at him Monday."

Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said said it will be important for the UT
defense to get off to a fast start against Texas A&M. "We have been playing
pretty well, but we've given up too many early drives," he said. " We need
to
get a good start against Texas A&M because we can't afford to give them
anything early."
He said the Aggies present a problem because they have the ability to run
and
throw. "We'll set out to stop the run because that's what we do," he said.
"You have to stop the run, but we'll also have to be very aware that they
can
hurt us with the pass, too."
Reese also said he is pleased with the depth he has on defense this year.
He
said his backup linemen, linebackers and defensive backs have all been
playing at a high level.

DT Shaun Rogers, who has been slowed the last month by a badly sprained
ankle, said it is feeling much better. "It's better than it has been since
I
injured it," he said.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Super DT Tommy Harris of Killeen Ellison has
changed his mind again and says he will take an official visit to Texas in
January. He said he had talked with the Texas coaches and has decided to
take
an official visit. His teammate, LB Yamil Lebron, a UT pledge, also says he
does not plan to take any visits to other schools. He had been quoted
earlier
as saying he would visit Oklahoma with Harris, but he said he is a firm
commitment to Texas and won't be traveling with Harris. . . Super LB
Derrick
Johnson of Waco says Texas is No. 1 with him. Johnson is as good an outside
linebacker prospect as I have seen in Texas in several years. He has
defensive back speed and a linebacker frame at about 6-3 or 6-4 and 205
pounds.

BASKETBALL NOTES: The Longhorns scored the last six points to come from
behind and defeat California, 57-54, in the second round of the Preseason
NIT
in a real defensive struggle in Austin. The victory propels the Horns into
the semifinals of the tournament and they will play next Wednesday in New
York's famed Madison Square Garden, probably against Duke. . . Defending
Class 5A champ Fort Bend Willowridge opened its season Tuesday with an
83-53
win over Hastings and point guard T. J. Ford, a UT signee, had 14 points
and
dominated the game with his pin-point passes. . . Super 6-7 sophomore
Kendrick Perkins had 18 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead
Beaumont Ozen to a 79-52 win over Heritage Christian.
