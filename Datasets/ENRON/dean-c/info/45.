Big 12 Roundup

Top five powers Oklahoma and Texas square off in Dallas Saturday in the Big
12 Conference headliner this week, but two other big games also are on tap.
Kansas State, a one-point loser to Oklahoma last week, hosts dangerous
Colorado, and Iowa State travels to Nebraska in a battle of unbeaten teams.
The Texas-Oklahoma scrap will go a long way toward deciding the Southern
Division winner.
In the Northern Division, perennial power Kansas State must defeat Colorado
to keep its title hopes alive.

Buckman Down to Horns, Heels
Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is ranked among the
nation's top 50 basketball recruits, took his official visit to UT last
weekend.
He visited North Carolina and Kansas earlier, and his mother told me those
are the only three schools he has been considering.
She also said he has eliminated Kansas and probably will choose between Texas
and North Carolina in the next couple of weeks.

Junior Basketball Classes Loaded

While there are several top senior stars in the boys' and girls' ranks this
year, there are four junior girls and two junior boys who are ranked among
the nation's top players already.
In fact, Beaumont Ozen's 6-11 Kendrick Perkins was picked as the No. 3
recruit in the country, regardless of class, on one national list, and some
people think 6-10 Ndudi Ebi of Houston Westbury Christian, is just as good.
The Longhorns are recruiting both of them, along with about everybody else in
the country.
The nation's top junior girl is 6-3 center Tiffany Jackson of Dallas Lincoln.
Kalee Carey, a 6-5 center at Class 4A power Canyon; Destiny Drew, a 6-2
center-forward at Corsby, and Emily Niemann, a 6-1 forward at Houston
Westbury Christian, also are drawing a lot of national attention.
Carey's father is a graduate of the UT Law School and Niemann's parents are
both Texas grads.
All four girls are considering Texas, but they also are being recruited by
many other top schools.

THE BURNT ORANGE COFFIN - Los Muertos No Hablan
by Bill Holchak - BJ '49
UT alumni are stunned to learn that the greatest  football recruit in Texas
history and his father have been murdered on their remote hill country ranch.
 But the Longhorns triumph in the end when a UT-educated detective tracks
down the killers - a group of international terrorists - and sends them to
their graves.

Star Nazareth Guard Picks UT

All-State guard Stephanie Thiel of Class A State Champion Nazareth, has
committed to the Texas women's basketball team.
Thiel, a 5-9 sharpshooter who averaged 21.1 points, 4.3 steals and 4.3
assists for the Swifts last season, was the Class A State Tournament MVP.
I saw her play in the state meet and she is an outstanding shooter and ball
handler.
Nazareth went 33-4 last year and its only losses were to larger schools.
She also played on the 2000 Nazareth team that also won a state title.
When I asked her why she chose the Longhorns and what other schools she
considered, she said, "I really had my heart set on going to Texas and didn't
really consider anyone else."
She is the third outstanding high school girl to commit to sign with Texas in
the early signing period next month.
Point guard Nina Norman, 5-7, of Jersey Village, committed several months
ago, and combo guard Tamra Cobbins, 5-5, of Kansas City, committed last week.
Sabrina Keys, a 6-2 center from Berkeley, Cal., had told me last week she
would visit Texas during the weekend, but she reaffirmed an earlier
commitment to Purdue and canceled the trip to Texas
LaToya Davis, a 6-2 center-forward from South Houston, is still considering
Texas, along with Texas Tech.
