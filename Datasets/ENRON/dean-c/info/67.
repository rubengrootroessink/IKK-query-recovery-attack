Pittman Fund Drive Lagging

Longhorns need to get busy or the plans at Shreveport Evangel to build the
Cole Pittman Memorial Field House are going down the drain.
Every UT fan I have talked to thinks the Longhorn football player was an
outstanding young man from an outstanding family and sincerely mourns his
passing.
If you feel that way and want to help preserve his memory and, while you are
at, help UT's image a lot at Shreveport Evangel, please mail a contribution,
large or small, today to the Cole Pittman Memorial Fund, 22023-1 Mossy Oaks,
Spring, Texas 77389.
If you can afford a big contribution, that's great. It's going to take some
big ones to get it done.
If you can't, how about sending $44? Cole's number at Texas was 44 and it
takes big ones and little ones to make this happen.
When a young man or woman dies, we all mourn for a while and then move on.
But the Pittman family can't ever truly move on. Parents who have to bury
their children are always haunted by it.
It won't make their pain go away if Longhorns are instrumental in seeing
those field house plans come true, but I guarantee you it will help ease it
because the Pittmans will know that UT people cared enough to help keep Cole
Pittman's memory alive.

Game Quotes . .

"Texas has a very good football team. They have great  speed on defense. They
have the great lateral movement and we tried to run at them and they did a
good job there as well. We had bad field position all night, but their
defense had something to do with that. They do a great job with the special
teams. They did a good job getting down the field and making the play."
- New Mexico State head coach Tony Samuel
* * * *
"We  started off slow, but they had played a game and we hadn't. It took a
while for us to get going and we have a lot of things to work on. I was
pleased with the way we ran the ball in the second half. They threw some
blitzes at us that they hadn't used before, so we made a conscious decision
to go with more three-step (drops instead of the normal 5-step drops). If
they are coming after us, we know they have to play man for man. We also
decided to force the run, even if they had nine in the box. We want to be
able to run it when we want to, regardless of the defensive lineup."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"We came out and played hard and really got with it in the first half. We
made some mistakes in the third quarter, but those are things we can go back
and coach next week. We thought we would see more option, but we ran them
down early and they got away from it."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"They played hard and threw a lot of different things against us. I talked to
Montrell (Flowers) after that second touchdown and he goes, 'Man, I got two
touchdown passes tonight and I only got two all of last year.' He did a great
job for us tonight."
- UT QB Chris Simms
* * * *
"I'm happy on my overall performance tonight, but I am even more happy that
the team has gotten the season off to a good start with a win. The passes
were perfect all night. They just came right to me. I have to give all of the
credit to Chris Simms. He was on target the whole time, which made my job
easier. All I had to do is catch it and run."
- Longhorn senior WR Montrell Flowers
* * * *
"Oh, it felt good. It was fun. I enjoyed it. With the guys we have up front,
it's fun to run the ball. It was great scoring my first college touchdown. It
probably won't hit me until I get out of this room. I had so much excitement
and energy running through me tonight. I really enjoyed this game. I loved
carrying the ball, the crowd and everything about tonight.  I was not really
nervous. I had three quarters to sit down and relax, so I think that helped
me out by not going in too early."
- Texas true freshman RB Cedric Benson

Scouting North Carolina

Longhorn coach Mack Brown had great success at North Carolina before coming
to Texas following an 11-1 season with the Tar Heels in 1997.
Carolina's football fortunes have waned since Brown's departure, but nothing
would make the Tar Heels happier than putting a licking on their former coach
when they come to Austin Saturday for an 11 a.m. game.
At 0-2, with a 41-27 loss at Oklahoma and a 23-7 league defeat at the hands
of Maryland already in the books, Carolina is a 22-point underdog.
The Tar Heels have an outstanding defensive front four, headed by Julius
Peppers, a 6-6, 290-pound end who Brown said "might be the nation's top
defensive player."
Ironically, he recruited Peppers for the Tar Heels before leaving for Texas.
Joey Evans, 6-4, 264, is the other defensive end, and he also is being eyed
by NFL scouts.
But so far this season, the Tar Heel defense hasn't had a chance because the
offense has committed eight turnovers in the two losses.
TB Willie Parker, a swift 200-pounder, had a 77-yard touchdown run against
Maryland.
At QB, Ronald Curry is quick and elusive, but is getting a battle from
freshman Darian Durant, a redshirt freshman who has relieved Curry in both
early season losses.
Durant has completed 22 of 40 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns, with
two interceptions. He has a QB efficiency rating of 113.79.
Curry has completed 11 of 25 passes for 135 yards with no touchdowns and two
interceptions. He has a QB efficiency rating of 70.54.
I expect Durant, a 5-11, 225-pounder with good speed and a strong arm, to be
the quarterback at Texas unless Curry gets off to a really quick start.
Brown said the eight turnovers have killed North Carolina in the two losses.
"They will quit turning the ball over at some point, and then they will be
hard to handle," he said.
Let's hope they keep on turning it over Saturday.
The Longhorns need to come out ready to play because the Tar Heels certainly
will.
This game has been dedicated to the memory of Cole Pittman, the young
Longhorn defensive tackle who was tragically killed in an automobile accident
in February.
