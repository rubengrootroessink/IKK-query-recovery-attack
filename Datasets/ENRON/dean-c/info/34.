> Chase Pittman Commits to Longhorns; UT Has 14 Pledges
>
> The Longhorns picked up their second top 100 national recruit in less
than
>
> week Sunday when DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of national powerhouse
> Shreveport Evangel, committed to Texas during ceremonies at his church.
> Pittman chose Texas over LSU at the end, but he was recruited by top
> schools
> from all over the country.
> He is the brother of Cole Pittman, the sophomore Longhorn DT who was
> killed
> in a vehicle accident in February while returning to Texas for spring
> football practice.
> I went to Lufkin Friday night to watch Evangel play Lufkin, one of the
top
>
> teams in Texas. In last week's USA Today rankings, Lufkin, led by QB
> Reggie
> McNeal, an A&M pledge, was rated No 4 in the country, and Evangel, led by

> sophomore QB John David Booty, 6-3, 185, 4.5, and Pittman, was rated No.
> 20.
> That rating will change this week because Evangel defeated Lufkin, 33-17,

> primarily because of Booty's throwing and a stout defense led by Pittman.
> Lufkin ran away from Pittman's right DE spot all night, but he still had,
> by
> my count, a sack, three QB pressures and eight tackles. McNeal is a 10.3
> sprinter, but Pittman twice came from the  far side to run him out of
> bounds.
> He has outstanding speed and quickness and is on many national top 100
> teams.
> The other national top 100 pledge the Horns got recently was from LB
> Garnet
> Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar,  who first committed to
> Oklahoma
> last Monday, then switched to Texas on Wednesday and said he is solid for
> the
> Longhorns. With a 1,200-plus SAT, he said UT's academic superiority over
> OU
> was a big factor.
> The other 12 recruits who have committed to UT are DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
> 320,
> 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
> Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of

> Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in
Arizona,
>
> and Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller; LBs Brian Robison, 6-3,
245,
>
> 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of Pflugerville
> Connally;
> OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5,
> 260,
> 4.9, of Allen;  TE-LB David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;
> WR
> Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don
> Malone,
> 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North Lamar;  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190,

> 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
> Eight of the players - Pittman, Smith, Davis, Anderson, Sendlein, Valdez,

> Tweedie and Thomas - have been on one or more national top 100 lists.
> Davis
> was on all the lists last year.
> The Longhorns probably will take about 25 to 27 players this year. The
> limit
> is 25 in one year, but Pittman will graduate in December and enroll in
> January, which means he can be counted against last year's class. Davis
> also
> has a chance to graduate in December and enroll in January. If he does,
he
>
> also count count against last year. The Longhorns are also on the short
> list
> of another outstanding DE who will graduate in December. He is Bryan
> Pickryl
> of Jenks, Oklahoma.
> * * * *
> If you are wondering who the remaining 11 to 13 signees will be, most or
> all
> will come from a 22-player group that includes QB Vincent Young of
Houston
>
> Madison, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee,
> WRs
> Marquis  Johnson of Champaign, Ill., Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and
> Anthony
> Wright of Klein Forest, OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of

> Spring Westfield, DEs Pickryl , Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Larry
> Dibbles of Lancaster, DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin
> of
> Mesquite, Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., and Loren Howard of
> Scottsdale Saquaro, Ariz., LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, CBs Ricky
> Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln and Jonathan Wade of Shreveport Evangel,
> Safeties Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Matthew Melton of Tyler and

> Athletes Eddorian McCullough of North Garland and DaBryan Blanton of
> Forney.
> The Horns have 50-50 or better shots at Marquis Johnson, Rodrique Wright,

> Kasey Studdard and Aaron Harris, who are all national top 100 players.
> Wright
> is the nation's top DT prospect.

> FOOTBALL NOTES: Look for sophomore Ivan Williams to start at tailback at
> Houston, with true freshman Cedric Benson getting a lot of action, too.
> Former starter Victor Ike also will play, but his primary role probably
> will
> be as a kickoff returner. . . True freshman LB Derrick Johnson will play
a

> lot more in future games. He already is UT's top tackler and sacker in a
