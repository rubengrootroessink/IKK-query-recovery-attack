Scouting Oklahoma

Texas and Oklahoma, both ranked in the top 15 for the first time since 1984=
,
meet at 11 a.m. Saturday in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas to battle for the
leadership in the Big 12's Southern Division.
The Sooners are 4-0 and ranked No. 10 in the Associated Press poll. The
Longhorns are 3-1 and are No. 11 in the AP voting.
OU has  six offensive and seven defensive starters back from last year's 7-=
5
team.
Oklahoma opened the season with a 55-14 rout of Texas-El Paso, then wallope=
d
Arkansas State, 45-7, hammered Rice, 42-14, and opened Big 12 play Saturday
with a 34-16 win over Kansas
Texas leads the all-time series 55-34-5 and has a three-year winning streak=
.
In fact, Texas dominated Oklahoma in the 1990s, going 7-2-1.
But coach Bob Stoops, in his second year as the Sooners' head man, has OU
humming along with an undefeated record and big ambitions.
Behind his all-out passing attack, the Sooners jumped out to a quick 17-0
lead over the Longhorns last season before UT defense coordinator Carl Rees=
e
changed his blitz packages and started getting enough pressure on QB Josh
Heupel to put the brakes on the OU offense and allow Texas to rally for a
38-28 win.
But it will be tougher this year because the Sooners of 1999 had no running
threat at all. They are rushing the ball much better this season, which kee=
ps
some of the pressure of Heupel.
The Longhorn defense should be able to pressure Heupel and corral the Soone=
r
backs if the Texas offense shows up early.
The Longhorn offense hasn't done much in the first quarter of any of its
games this year. One field goal and very little yardage is all UT has
garnered offensively this season.
But QB Major Applewhite, who killed the Sooners last year with his clutch
throws, seems to be regaining his magic touch after off-season knee surgery=
,
and sophomore RB Kenny Hayter had his coming-out party Saturday.
They keys to a Longhorn victory: (1) get a quick start on both sides of the
ball, (2) pressure Heupel and make him throw before he wants to, (3) a
reasonably balanced offensive attack, (4) no punt blocks, and (5) win the
turnover and time-of-possession battles.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

The big Texas-Oklahoma clash in Dallas is the headliner for the second week
of Big 12 play. It features the two pre-season favorites in the South and
also pits two nationally ranked teams.
Nebraska visits Iowa State in a battle of unbeatens in the North, but the
Huskers should romp.
The potential upset of the week features winless Colorado at Texas A&M. The
Buffaloes are winless, but they have played four very tough foes in a row.
They are a dangerous team, at their place or yours.

Recruiting Roundup

Brent Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel, the top QB prospect in
Louisiana, took his official visit to Texas last weekend.
I saw him going into the Texas dressing room after the game and he looks to
be about as big as advertised. He also appeared to be having a really good
time.
His parents came to Austin with him, which always is a good sign on an
official visit.
Look for Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch or Rawls to commit to the
Longhorns within the next week to 10 days. Nordgren is the most likely futu=
re
Longhorn, but it could be Rawls.
Actually, it's a great situation for the Longhorns because Nordgren is the
top QB recruit in Texas and Rawls is the best one in Louisiana, so either o=
ne
would be a big catch.
* * * *
The Longhorns are still at 16 commitments. They will sign between 22 and 25
players, so there are six to nine spots left to fill.
I think most of those spots will be filled from a group of 14 players
consisting of Nordgren or Rawls; FB James Buchanan of Sarasota, Fla.; OLs
Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison; DLs
Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Kaelen Jakes of Placentia, Cal.; DEs
Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn.;
LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; S Dewayne Brandon of Temple; Ath Joseph Addai o=
f
Houston Sharpstown and the Galena Park North Shore duo of TE James Moses an=
d
DE/LB Jonathon Jackson.
I think the Horns have at least 50-50 shots at Nordgren, Jakes, Everett,
Hall, Johnson, Brandon and Addai. I'll be surprised if they don't sign four
or five players from that group.
Buchanan, Hightower, Winston, Harris, Jackson and Moses are all strongly
considering Texas, but they also are looking at a lot of other schools.
Texas really needs to sign Harris because he is a great defensive line=20
prospect who really would be a great fit in defensive coordinator Carl
Reese's attacking style.
This is a year when great offensive line prospects are plentiful, but great
defensive linemen are scarce, and that is why Harris is such an important
part of the Longhorn recruitizing puzzle.
There is a chance some other big-time recruit will enter the picture, but
most of the remaining scholarships will go to players in one of the two
groups above.
* * * *
While big defensive line prospects are in short supply this year, I've
already seen three juniors who will be big-time recruits next year.
I've written about them before, but DTs Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.8, of
Mesquite, and Rodrique Wright, 6-4, 290, 5.0, of Alief Hastings are the rea=
l
deal and so is DE Travis Leitko, 6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands. Leitko ca=
me
to the Texas camp this summer.
I have seen Wright and Leitko play twice each, and have seen Martin once an=
d
also watched a lot of tape of him playing running back and in the defensive
line. Any college would take all three in a heartbeat if they were seniors.
The program at Hastings lists Wright as weighing close to 350 pounds, but h=
e
looked more like a 270-to-290 pounder when I saw him play early this year
against Galena Park North Shore. He was a lot heavier last year, but he has
lost some weight and really is a great prospect.
While I haven't seen them play, I also have heard good things about some
other big defensive line juniors, including Damon Brown, 6-5, 265, 4.8, of
Houston Washington; Tully Jontzen, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of Keller, and Jarre
Rhodes, 6-6, 260, 4.8, of Dallas Lincoln, who also is a tight end.
While we're on the subject of juniors, there is a great linebacker at
Longview named Marvin Byrdsong. He is 6-3, weighs about 235 and runs in the
4.5 range.
Other super juniors include QBs Reggie McNeal, 6-3, 190, 4.4, of Lufkin and
Vincent Young, 6-5, 195, 4.5, of Houston Madison; RB Selvin Young, 5-11, 19=
5,
4.4, of Jersey Village; TE-OL Eric Winston, 6-6, 270, 5.0, Midland Lee, and
DB Broderick Thomas, 6-1, 180, 4.4, of Longview.

that give you an inside view of Longhorn sports.
