Scouting Kansas

The Longhorns have another long road trip this week, traveling to Lawrence =
to
take on Kansas at 1 p.m. Saturday. The game will not be televised.
The Jayhawks are 4-5. They lost to SMU, 31-17, to open the season, then bea=
t
Alabama-Birmingham, 23-20, and Southern Illinois, 42-0, before falling to
Oklahoma, 34-16, and Kansas State, 52-13.
Then they defeated Missouri, 38-17, and Colorado, 23-15, before dropping a
45-39 game to Texas Tech and then getting hammered by Nebraska, 56-17.
The Jayhawks have a unique offense. QB Dylen Smith is one of the rare
quarterbacks who feels just as comfortable running the option or dropping
back into a four-wide receiver set. He is 6-1, 190, and fast and shifty.
Texas coach Mack Brown says Smith "is a really athletic quarterback who has=
 a
great arm and who can make plays" with his arm or his quick feet.
He also says RB David Winbush, 5-7, 180, "is the leading rusher in Kansas
history, and that's a school that has had Gale Sayers and John Riggins" of
Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins fame, respectively.
WR Harrison Hill is one of the best in the league.
Defensively, nose tackle Nate Dwyer, 6-3, 300, is the anchor in the middle =
of
the line, and LBs Chaz Murphy, 6-3, 252, and Andrew LeClair, 6-6, 245, are
big run stoppers.
The Jayhawks are giving up more yards than they are gaining, which is never=
 a
good sign, but they have been impressive at times, particularly when they a=
re
playing at home.
The Longhorns are a 13-point favorite, but this is a dangerous road game
because Kansas has to beat Texas and then Iowa State next week to qualify f=
or
a bowl game.
To win the Horns need to start quickly, like they did in Lubbock, and the
defense needs to pressure Smith and keep Winbush under control.
If Major Applewhite's knee injury turns out to be serious, they also need t=
o
have a balanced offense to keep all the pressure from falling on Chris Simm=
s'
inexperienced shoulders. They also need to score more touchdowns than field
goals when they get inside the 10.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska visits Kansas State in a game that will decide the Northern Divisi=
on
crown Saturday, while top-ranked Oklahoma travels to Texas A&M in a huge ga=
me
in the Southern Division.
The winner of the Nebraska-Kansas State game is a virtual lock to represent
the North in the Big 12 championship game.
If Oklahoma beats A&M, the Sooners also will be assured of a spot in the
title game. But if the Aggies pull an upset, then a three-way tie would exi=
st
in the South if Texas beats Kansas.

Recruiting Roundup

OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter created quite a stir last week when he
was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he remains committed to Texas, but
might take a visit or two just to be sure of his commitment.
Texas coach Mack Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both
parties. He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will
guarantee them scholarships, and they are supposed to guarantee they will
honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools.
Scott has talked off an on about visiting other schools, but he hasn't set =
up
any visits yet. I'll keep you posted if he does.
* * * *
QB-Athlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship, another UT pledge, says
Nebraska continues to recruit him, but he says he is solid for the Longhorn=
s.
* * * *
Central Texas normally doesn't have very many top recruits, but four of bes=
t
in the state and in the nation his year are in Central Texas and three of
them play in District 13-5A, which stretches from Waco in the north to
Georgetown in the south.
Those four recruits will go a long ways toward determining whether the
Longhorns have a great recruiting class or just a very good one.
The 13-5A players are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johns=
on
of Waco and DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple.
The other top prospect is QB-Athlete Quan Cosby of Mart, who led his team t=
o
a 15-0 record and a Class 2A state title last year.
Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson, Brandon
and Cosby. Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference, but he has
been more noncommital about his college choice recently.
Texas has a good chance to get all four of them and that would really put t=
he
icing on an already outstanding recruiting class.
Student Sports magazine currently has UT ranked No. 2 behind Michigan in th=
e=20
national recruiting rankings.
If the Horns get three or four of those Central Texans I mentioned earlier,
they will have a great shot at the top spot.
And for those of you who have expressed concern that the Longhorns' two-los=
s
season could pose a problem, Michigan has three losses already. A 7-2 seaso=
n
at this point is a very good year to sell to recruits.
I still expect the Longhorns to sign 25 or 26 kids. With 19 already
committed, that leaves room for only six or seven more players.
* * * *
In addition to the obvious recruiting targets I have been writing about
recently, there are two super prospects in Louisiana who are talking about
taking official visits to Texas the weekend of the Texas-Texas A&M game.
They are DT Marquise Hill, 6-7, 290, 5.1, of New Orleans De La Salle and TE
Marcus Spears, 6-5, 270, 4.75, of Baton Rouge Southern Lab.
The two Louisiana prospects and DL Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 265, 4.75, of Valenci=
a,
Cal., are the only out-of-state prospects on the Longhorn radar screen at
this time. UT has a very good shot at Jakes. Hill and Spears are long shots=
