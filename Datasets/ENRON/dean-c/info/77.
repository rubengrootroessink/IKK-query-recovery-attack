 Horns Upset Long Beach in NCAA Baseball; Football Camps Start Soon

 No. 3 seed Texas (35-24) upset No. 2 seed Long Beach State (35-22), 11-2,
 Friday in the first round of the NCAA baseball regional at Stanford.
 The Longhorns will play in the winner's bracket finals of the
 double-elimination tournament at 5 p.m. Saturday, probably against
 top-seeded
 Stanford, which was playing No. 4 seed Marist in the second game Friday.
 Gerrit Simpson tossed his sixth complete game to lead the Longhorns to
 victory. He struck out 12 and allowed nine hits.
 Texas scored twice in the fourth and picked up five more runs in the fifth
 to
 take a 7-0 lead and coast to the win. Jeff Ontiveros had a two-run homer
 for
 Texas and Sam Anderson had three hits, three runs batted in and two runs
 scored.
 If the Horns win their 5 p.m. game Saturday, they will need only one more
 v
 ictory to win the sub-regional. But, if they lose, they will have to play
 again Saturday night in an elimination game to try to get another shot at
 the
 undefeated team Sunday. The team that emerges from the loser's bracket
 would
 have to beat the winner's bracket champion twice Sunday to advance.

 The Longhorns start their summer football camps a week from Saturday, and
 some of the top players in the state and in the nation plan to attend.
 DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and FB-LB Brandon Hancock of
 Clovis
 West, Cal., head the out-of-state prospects who plan to come to the UT
 camps.
 Sendlein told me he probably will commit to Texas after the June 3 camp,
 and
 Hancock says he is very interested in Texas, but probably won't commit to
 anyone prior to the football season.
 Sendlein is the top prospect in Arizona and Hancock is one of the top
 recruits in California after dazzling everyone at a Nike camp in his home
 state. He checked in at 6-1, 242, then ran a 4.49 40, had a vertical leap
 of
 39 inches and bench pressed 185 pounds 43 times. Hancock said he will come
 to
 the UT camp that starts on June 10.
 Top Texas players who plan to come to one of the UT camps include QBs Paul

 Thompson of Leander and Jamie Beeghley of Midland Christian, WR-TE David
 Thomas of Wollforth Frenship, OLs Jeff Lebby of Andrews and Tony Ugoh of
 Spring Westfield, DEs Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Nick Owino of
 Alief
 Elsik, DT Earl Anderson of San  Marcos, LBs Marvin Byrdsong of Longview,
 Garnett Smith of Arlington  Lamar and Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flour

 Bluff, CB Donald Burgs of Houston Madison and RB-Athlete Paul Mosley of
 Austin Anderson.
 The state's top RB, Albert Hardy of Galena Park, says he hasn't decided
 whether to attend a summer camp, but don't be too surprised if he shows up

 for one of the UT mini-camps.
 Texas still has just one commitment ? fine OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood ?
 but
 the Longhorns will pick up several more in June. That's when the Texas
 coaches always jump start their recruiting and pick up eight or 10
 pledges.

 An internet site calling itself  Collegefootballnews.com has picked Texas
 to
 go 11-0 during the regular season and beat Nebraska in the Big 12
 Championship Game.
 I liked that part of it, but then it picked Oklahoma to have the best
 defensive line and Texas to have the best linebackers in the Big 12. Texas

 will have a better defensive line than Oklahoma, and I know OU and several

 other Big 12 teams have better linebackers than Texas, so that doesn't do
 a
 lot for the site's credibility.
 The Texas coaches are proud of their defensive line and secondary, but
 they
 worry a lot about their linebackers.
 The site also rated UT No. 1 at quarterback, wide receiver, offensive line

 and defensive secondary  in the Big 12.
