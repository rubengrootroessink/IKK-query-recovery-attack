> Texas head coach Mike Brown named the starters Monday for Saturday
night's
>
> season-opening football game with New Mexico State, and there was only
one
>
> major surprise.
> That was at tight end where Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards were listed as
> co-starters. "I don't know who will run out there first," Brown said,
"but
>
> they'll both see plenty of action."
> He also said Tillman Holloway and Derrick Dockery are co-starters at left

> guard, but that was no surprise because they have battled back and forth
> throughout the pre-season practices.
> Junior Victor Ike, as expected, is the starting tailback, with super
> freshman
> Cedric Benson and big sophomore Ivan Williams listed as co-second
teamers.
>
> Brown also said all three tailbacks will play a lot.
> Senior Maurice Gordon, as expected, was tabbed to start at left defensive

> tackle. "We had to figure a way to get him on the field," Brown said.
> "That's
> why we moved him (from defensive end). He probably runs 4.6 or better and
> we
> think he's really going to be good for us."
> Brown also said Nathan Vasher and Ahmad Brooks will be the starting
> safeties
> with Dakarai Pearson backing up at both spots.
> The Longhorns are 42-point favorites over NM State for their 6 p.m. game,
> but
> Brown said the contest "is a great challenge for us. They should have
> beaten
> Louisville last week and Louisville was a 9-or-10-win team last year."
> Louisville went 9-3 last year and NM State had a lead at the half before
> two
> fumbles deep in Louisville territory were returned for touchdowns.
> Brown had a good time discussing the Longhorns at his Monday press

> he

> shouldn't start."

> FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorns have the best opening game record in the
Big
>
> 12. In 108 years of playing college football, Texas is 88-17-3 in opening

> games. That's an .829 winning percantage. If the Horns hadn't gone 1-7 in

> openers between 1986 and 1993, that great percentage would be almost off
> the

passes
>
> (66.7%) for 328 yards and four touchdowns in the Longhorns' three
> scrimmages.
> He did not allow an interception in the scrimmages. . . True freshman LB
> Derrick Johnson led all defenders in the scrimmages with 20 tackles. . .
> Starting LB Lee Jackson probably will miss the opener with a turf toe and

> Texans - Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest.
> Johnson lists the Horns No. 1 and might commit when he visits. He says he
