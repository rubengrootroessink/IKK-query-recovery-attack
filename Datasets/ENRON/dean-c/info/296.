Seniors Honored

The Longhorns honored their senior football players Saturday in their final
game at Royal Memorial Stadium.
QB Major Applewhite drew two tremendous ovations, one when he entered the
game in the fourth quarter and another when he was relieved by redshirt
freshman Chance Mock.
Applewhite hold most UT passing records, but lost his starting job to Chris
Simms after severe injuries to both knees limited his mobility.
Nine senior starters - three on offense and six one defense - also were
honored.
The offensive senior starters are tackle Mike Williams, guard Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and center Matt Anderson.
The defensive senior starters are tackle Maurice Gordon, linebackers De'Andre
Lewis, Everick Rawls and Tyrone Jones, cornerback Quentin Jammer and safety
Ahmad Brooks.
Other scholarship seniors include tight end Mike Jones, cornerback Ervis
Hill, defensive ends Jermain Anderson and Marcus Wilkins and defensive tackle
Corey Bradford.
Senior walk-ons include defensive back Nathan Kaspar, wide receiver Marcus
Walther, running back Kyle Hunt, offensive lineman Robbie Nethercutt and
defensive ends Travis Slagle and Chris Stroup.

Game Quotes . .

"They are right up there with the best teams we've played. They are extremely
gifted defensively and they run well. They are without a doubt the best
secondary we have played this season."
- Kansas interim head coach Tom Hayes, who became acting head coach last
Monday when Terry Allen was fired. The Jayhawks schedule has been voted the
toughest in the country
* * * *
"I thought it was a great team game. The offense got 600 yards and the
defense held the other team to 60. I wish they were all like that. Our kids
played really hard and I'm proud of them."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I'm just really pleased overall and I'm glad Cedric (Benson) finally had a
long run so you will quit asking him about it."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis, who was picking up on a comment by
Benson that he was glad to pop a long one so people would quit asking him
what was wrong
* * * *
"As a kid, this is what you dream about. My dreams are falling into place. If
I continue to work hard, 1,000 yards will come. I have a great offensive
line, a great fullback, a great quarterback and great coaches. With all that,
what can't be done?"
 - Longhorn RB Cedric Benson, talking about his  chances of becoming the
first UT freshman to rush for 1,000 yards
* * * *
"He's probably running full speed at three steps. He hits the line of
scrimmage at full speed. He attacks the line of scrimmage and he usually
falls forward. He's one of the quickest guys I've ever seen. I don't think it
takes him long to go from zero to 60."
 - Texas running back coach Bruce Chambers, talking about Benson
* * * *
"We never gave up. I felt the offensive line played hard the whole game.
Unfortunately, that doesn't always translate into wins. Texas has an
extremely talented defense and they came out and showed us exactly that
today."
- Kansas offensive tackle Justin Hartwig
* * * *
"He's the best I've ever gone against. Size, speed, he has it all. I've never
seen a guy that big who can run that fast."
- Kansas cornerback Andrew Davidson, talking about trying to cover Roy
Williams
* * * *
"I thought that if we kept them from scoring for the rest of the first half,
holding the score to 21-0, then maybe we could come back, but Texas kept
making big plays and the next thing you know it was 59-0. Their skill players
are unbelievable.."
- Kansas defensive lineman  Brock Teddleton

Scouting Texas A&M

Texas and Texas A&M both have open dates this week to get ready for their
annual showdown the Friday after Thanksgiving.
It's in College Station this year and it has an 11 a.m. kickoff and will be
televised by ABC.
In case you have forgotten, they had an early kickoff in College Station two
years ago and the Longhorns, with a sick quarterback and two injured wide
receivers, got beat, 20-16.
There were some other factors, but suffice it to say the Longhorns won't stay
in College Station the night before the game this year.
Texas is 9-1 overall and 6-1 in the Big 12, while A&M is 7-3 overall and 4-3
in the Big 12.
The Aggies have had offensive problems all year and the situation has
mushroomed in the last two games when they were shut out by Texas Tech and
then held to five first downs by Oklahoma in a 31-10 loss Saturday.
Both teams have solid defenses, but UT has an edge in all four major
defensive categories, as you can see in the statistical rankings below.
But the Longhorns also have one of the nation's most potent offenses and that
should negate the Aggies' home field advantage.
To win this one, the Longhorns need to stay with their balanced offensive
attack, connect on some big plays and, above all, don't turn the ball over
and give the Aggies a short field.
This Aggie team has had difficulty making drives, and hasn't scored an
offensive touchdown in its last two games. It won't have much luck against
the strong Longhorn defense.
The keys here are simple:
1. Win the turnover battle.
2. Don't accept any food or drink from strangers.
I'm usually a little more serious about trips to Collie Station, but this
Aggie team's best offense is its defense, and that won't be enough on Nov. 23.
If you followed the news about the melee in Lubbock after Tech's 12-0 victory
over A&M, these two thoughts come to mind:
1. Only Aggies would go all the way to Lubbock to fight each other.
2. Only Aggies would sit in the stands at a hostile field and wait 30 minutes
for the other team's fans to tear down the goal posts.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Four Named to Honor Hall

Three former University of Texas standout female student-athletes and one
distinguished former coach were honored Friday by induction  as members of
the second class of the UT Women's Athletics Hall of Honor.
The four inductees were:
* Nell Fortner, a volleyball and basketball standout from 1977-81, who
starred on UT's 1981 Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) national championship volleyball team and is a nationally-renowned
basketball coach at the college, USA Basketball and WNBA levels.
She coached the gold-medalist 2000 U.S. Olympic basketball team before
assuming her current role as general manager and head coach of the WNBA's
Indiana Fever.
* Joan Pennington Dyer, an  AIAW national swimming champion and former
national swimmer of the year, who swam from UT from 1978-80 and from 1982-84.
* Retha Swindell, All-American basketball standout from 1975-79,  who is the
only player in Longhorn history to surpass the 1,500 mark in both career
points and rebounds and who went on to play professional basketball.
* Pat Weis was the first Longhorn women's golf coach who served in that role
from 1974-93 and coached UT to six top 10 finishes at the AIAW National
Championships and coached numerous Longhorn golfers to both All-America and
National Player of the Year honors.
