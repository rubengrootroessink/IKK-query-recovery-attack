Good as golden
Chris Simms has the name, the arm strength and the confidence. So is he
ready to inherit the Horns offense?


By Paul J. Weber
Daily Texan Staff

When Chris Simms reported to Texas' preseason camp earlier this month, he
did so bearing an enormous chip on his shoulder.

And it had nothing to do with the way the Longhorns' quarterback situation
was being handled.

"I hate putting on shoulder pads. I just hate it. I want the smallest
shoulder pads ever," Simms said. "Really, I wish I could just put my
kneepads on my shoulder. It makes me feel restricted, especially after
throwing without pads all summer. But I eventually got used to it."

His adjustment must of happened during the first afternoon practice of
two-a-days. Because for the past two weeks that Simms has engineered the
Horns' first-team offense at Whitaker Fields, there has scarcely been a
moment where the Texas sophomore hasn't looked comfortable operating behind
center. Sure, interceptions have been thrown and routes have been mistimed,
but Simms' trademark confidence has remained constant.

All the while, Simms has spent a lot of time in the middle of a day-to-day
frenzy at Texas, where a starting quarterback has yet to be named for the
season opener just 10 days away. Texas head coach Mack Brown has shyed away
from giving any indication as to who the starter might be or when the
selection will be announced, leaving just speculation as to whether it will
be Simms or Major Appplewhite who comes out on the field first Sept. 9
against Louisiana-Lafayette.

"We're doing what all you guys are doing," Brown said. "[Offensive
coordinator] Greg [Davis] and I are looking at, evaluating it, and trying
to
be fair. But honestly, I think both of these guys could play in the NFL."

That may be looking a bit too far ahead, but for the quarterback with the
regal NFL bloodlines, Simms has been taking the situation in stride.

He's brushed off the endless questions about the issue with ease, and in
the
meantime, has put together a string of practices that revealed a much more
patient and mature quarterback than the one abruptly thrust into
high-pressure situations toward the end of last season.

"All of this hubub hasn't been much of a distraction. I don't read the
news,
I don't read the newspaper," Simms said. "All I really watch is
SportsCenter
in my life. That's all I ever watch. That's all my life is. Practice, eat,
nap. Practice, eat, nap."

Simms finished his freshman campaign as the Horns' quarterback, after
Applewhite blew out his knee in the Cotton Bowl during Texas' 27-6 loss to
close out 1999. Surgery and rehabilitation kept the reigning co-Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year sidelined through spring drills, where Simms
assumed the starting quarterback position and showed every reason why he
was
one of the nation's top recruits when he came out of high school the year
before.

"He's got sharp instincts and a tremendous arm," Texas offensive
coordinator
Greg Davis said. "A guy like Chris gives you a lot of options in your
quarterback, between his mental understanding of the game and his physical
ability."

Simms reported to campus this fall about 17 pounds heavier than he was at
this time a year ago, as the 6-foot 5-inch signal caller added muscle in
the
weight room this offseason. He joked the biggest difference in his added
strength was "looking better in my uniform," but Simms does think the extra
muscle has given him better arm strength and has increased his ability to
take a hit, even though Brown has not allowed his quarterbacks to be
touched
this preseason.

"People ask me if I'm scared when I'm out there, and if I'm scared of
getting hit by these big guys while I'm out there. And yeah, I am scared,"
Simms said. "Because I don't want to fail. I don't want to be a failure. "

If Simms does start this season, his fear of failure should be eased by the
targets he'll be throwing to downfield. Texas has added a bumper crop of
wide receivers dubbed The Big Three to their offensive mix, with Roy
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson poised to become big targets for
the
Texas passing attack this year.

And unlike Applewhite one of the more stationary quarterbacks in the pocket
Simms can be mobile when need be, though he doesn't really consider himself
a scrambler. Or at least one like Virginia Tech's Michael Vick, who like
Simms, is a lefty.

"I don't think I could ever do what he could do," Simms said. "I might be
able to run a 4.25 forty off a cliff, but that's about it."

And does Simms have an ideal situation for his playing time this season?

"Do I have an ideal situation? I think you can figure it out," Simms said.
"Just write it down, and you'll figure it out. "
