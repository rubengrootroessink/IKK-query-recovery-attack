Longhorns Get Pledge from Euless Trinity Defensive Back

Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.4, a defensive back from Euless Trinity who
came
to one of Texas' three-day summer camps earlier this month, committed to
the
Longhorns Wednesday.
Johnson, a hard-hitting safety who had 42 tackles last season for the 9-2
Trojans, who had one of the top defenses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is
moving to quarterback this season.
His father, David, told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns
because
"the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and
with
the classy way they operate. They were very open and very straightforward."
David Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to
a
Texas A&M camp last summer. He said several schools called his son in May,
the month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit.
He
said calls came from coaches at Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas,
TCU
and others, but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the
recruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season.
Braden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines. David Johnson was on a
football scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a career-ending
shoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for old-time football fans.
One is Bill Johnson, who had a 20-year career as a player and coach with
the
San Francisco 49ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland
Browns' staff. The other is Gil Johnson, the quarterback on the great SMU
teams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote.
Braden Johnson is a three-sport star. He plays centerfield in baseball and
runs on the 400-meter relay in track. He also is a good student.
Johnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month. The
others are WR-DB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, and OLs Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Will Allen of
Houston Cypress Falls. In addition, Alfio Randall, a super OL recruit a
year
ago, is on track to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he
will
enroll at Texas in January.
All five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending
one of the Longhorns' summer camps.
Scott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top 100 lists.
RECRUITING NOTES: The top running back and the top quarterback  in Texas
both
say they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong
contention for both. The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee, who rushed for
3,526 yards and 51 touchdowns in leading Lee to a 16-0 season and it's
second
straight Class 5A state championships. Both those incredible totals are
Class
5A records. The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, who threw for
2,500 yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season
that knocked him out of his teams' final five games. He still passed for
1,170 yards. . . The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the 24
members of the "Super Team" in Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine.
They
are Scott and Robinson. The only other member of the "Super Team" who has
committed is Madisonville RB David Underwood, the Aggies' No. 1 RB target
who
announced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine. Allen made
the second team and Carter made the third team. . . There are at least five
super players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year.
That's right ? they were so good as sophomores that every school in the
country already knows about them. They are QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 195, 4.5,
of Houston Madison; RB Selvin Young, 5-11, 188, 4.4, of Houston Jersey
Village; DL Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.7, of Mesquite; DE Travis Leitko,
6-5,
250, 4.7, of The Woodlands, and TE-OL Eric Winston, 6-6, 265, 5.0, of
Midland
Lee. Young ran for 2,204 yards last year in a tough district. Young threw
for
1,007 yards and ran for 730 more as a sophomore, also in a tough league.
Martin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that he's a
terrific pass rusher and run stopper. Leitko was a dominating force as a
sophomore last year on The Woodlands' playoff team. Winston is a great
athlete who was one of the stars on Lee's title team as a sophomore. Leitko
and Young came to Texas' summer camp earlier this month.
In the "did-you-know" department: Nebraska was 81-8 in the last seven
football seasons. That makes the Huskers 80-5 against the rest of the world
during that span, but only 1-3 against our Longhorns.
