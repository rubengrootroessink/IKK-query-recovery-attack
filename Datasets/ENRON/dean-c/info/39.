Women Get Top Recruit
The Longhorn women got a commitment Sunday from Tamra Cobbins, a 5-5 combo
guard at Kansas City Schlagle High School.
She chose the Longhorns over Kansas at the end after being recruited by top
schools all over the country.
She is lightning quick, and like the Longhorns' other early guard pledge, 5-7
Nina Norman of Jersey Village, has the passing and ball handling skills to
play the point and the scoring ability to play shooting guard.
The Longhorns also will get visits this weekend from  a top center, Sabrina
Keys, 6-2, of Berkeley, Cal., who has narrowed her choices to UT and Purdue,
and from the nation's top junior prospect, 6-3 center Tiffany Jackson of
Dallas Lincoln.
Keys is a top rebounder who loves crashing the boards. In fact, she said the
reason she isn't considering any Pac 10 schools is  officials in that league
"call too many picky fouls. In the Big 10 and Big 12, they let you play."
The junior class of girls is one of the best in Texas high school history
with lots of top talent, headed by Jackson, 6-5 Kalee Carey of Canyon, 6-0
Emily Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian and 6-2 lefthander Destiny Drew
of Crosby.
Carey's father is a graduate of the UT law school and both Niemann's parents
are Texas' graduates. Both are considering Texas, but both are wide open at
this point.
Carey's AAU team, the West Texas Star Hawks, won the national AAU
16-and-under championship during the summer. She averaged 19 points, 11
rebounds and 8 blocks during the national tourney.
The Star Hawks also defeated a highly touted California team three times in
three meetings. The California team had three Tennessee signees on it.
Niemann averaged 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks shots last year at
Westbury Christian. She is an outstanding all-around player.

THE BURNT ORANGE COFFIN - Los Muertos No Hablan
by Bill Holchak - BJ '49
UT alumni are stunned to learn that the greatest  football recruit in Texas
history and his father have been murdered on their remote hill country ranch.
 But the Longhorns triumph in the end when a UT-educated detective tracks
down the killers - a group of international terrorists - and sends them to
their graves.
