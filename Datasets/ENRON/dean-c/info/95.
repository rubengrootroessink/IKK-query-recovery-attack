> He also said he is very encouraged by the work of freshmen walk-on
kickers

finding

> "They were tremendous as true freshman and helped this team win nine

> he said, "but they are bigger and stronger and more experienced now and

> True freshman CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes had missed several

Monday

> He said Griffin and all the other freshmen DBs have talent and are
working

> True freshman DT Kaelen Jakes continues to be impressive in the
one-on-one
>
> pass-rushing drills. He has been almost unstoppable against all the top
> offensive linemen in that drill. At 255 pounds, he is light for a tackle,

Kalen

> Thornton, who started nine games last year as a true freshman, both  have

bigger

workout,
