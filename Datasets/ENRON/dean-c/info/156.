Four Longhorn Substitutes Leaving Team; UT Will Sign at Least 22

Three Longhorn reserves

- sophomore CB Kendrick Turner, sophomore LB Jamal
Joyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore
- have quit the football team
and will transfer to other schools, and a fourth backup
- redshirt freshman
FB Jason Barron
- will miss the 2000 season for academic reasons.
Barron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team, but
I
would be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback
chart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least 22 players in February.
With 80 players on scholarship and only 13 seniors, they will need to have
some more players leave next year to stay within the NCAA's 85-scholarship
limit.
None of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of
the
quartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had
stayed. Joyner was on suspension. He was the last to leave of the four
players who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game.
Brown wished all of the young men well, and gave the three who are
transferring unconditional releases.

Eric Hall, 6-3, 235, 4.5, the outstanding DE prospect from Clarksville,
Tenn., told me today he is going to take his official visit to Texas the
Sept. 9 weekend and will see the season-opening game against
Louisiana-Lafayette. He said he strongly favors Texas, and the only other
schools he is considering are Nebraska and Tennessee.
"I see myself going to Texas," he said. "I was born in Texas (Fort Hood)
and
I really like the state."
Another top out-of-state DE who is strongly considering Texas is Kaelen
Jakes,  6-4, 265, 4.8 of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Texas for  four years
and
said he is considering the Horns, along with USC, UCLA, Arizona and
Nebraska.
He said his team doesn't keep invidual stats, but estimated he had "between
15
and 18 sacks last season." He said he played DE, DT and NG for Valencia
last
year.

DT Tommie Harris of Killen Ellison is the top DL in Texas this year and is
one of the top players in the country. He says he favors Texas over Florida
State and others. Harris has been working out in Houston with a personal
trainer this summer. UT center signee Trey Bates works out with the same
trainer. Stockar McDougle, a former Oklahoma Sooner OL who now is in the
NFL,
is Harris' cousin, and is paying for the personal trainer for Harris.
* * * *
Texas has 11 early commitments, including six offensive linemen. The OLs
are
Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott
of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal
Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric
Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian
Carter of The Woodlands.
Ten players who signed with Texas are slated to play in the annual
North-South High School Football All-Star game at Rice Stadium next Tuesday
at 7 p.m. Scheduled to play for the North are QBs Chance Mock of The
Woodlands and Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest, WRs Roy Williams of Odessa
Permian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand Prairie and Nathan Vasher of
Texarkana
and kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell.
Scheduled to play for the South are OT Lionel Garr of Diboll, C Trey Bates
of
Fort Bend Elkins and DTs Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier and Marcel Moses of
Texas City. Davis and Moses failed to qualify academically and are headed
to
the JC ranks. Johnson has a sprained ankle that will keep him out of the
game.

FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorn DBs are extremely impressed with Sloan Thomas
and Tony Jeffery, who are two of the outstanding incoming freshman wide
receiver prospects. They said Thomas is a big, physical receiver with great
speed, and they say Jeffery is very hard to cover because he has such great
moves and quickness. The players have been working out against each other
during voluntary summer drills.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL RECRUITING: CoCo Reed, a 5-11 forward from Houston
Jersey
Village, has committed to play for the Texas women. She averaged 19 points
as
a junior and averaged 23 points in AAU play this summer. She lives with 5-6
junior point guard Nina Norman, who will be one of the nation's top
prospects
next year. Reed also was recruited by Duke, LSU, Rutgers, Florida and
Maryland, among others.
The Longhorn women's top incoming freshmen
- 6-1 Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro
and 6-2 Annissa Hastings of San Antonio Sam Houston
- were named to the AAU
All-American Team Saturday at the conclusion of the National AAU Tournament
in Clarksville, Tenn.
