> "I didn't go to any camps, but I went to Notre Dame and Texas A&M and
> Texas
> to look around. I had planned to go to Oklahoma, too, to take a look, but

> Texas just really impressed me and I decided to go ahead and commit to

> Tweedie said his top four schools were Texas, A&M, Notre Dame and OU, but
> he

in

> "I really like the coaches and the players at Texas," he said. "The

where

> Tweedie plays tackle at Allen, but said he wouldn't mind moving to guard

> play wherever I can help the most."
> He has very quick feet and is extremely athletic. He's very strong for
his

> 6-3,
> 245, 4.6, of Splendora, told me Wednesday night he has narrowed his
> choices
> to Texas and Houston, and is leaning the Longhorns' way. "I visited Texas

and

> BASKETBALL NOTES: Head coach Rick Barnes has promoted his administrative

> assistant coach. Kohtala left to become head coach at Alma College in
> Michigan. Springmann has been with Barnes throughout his three years at

> recruit
> off campus), has helped organize the summer camps and has performed many
> other duties on the basketball staff. . . Daniel Horton, 6-2, an

> shooting guard at Cedar Hill, has chosen Michigan over Texas and Florida.

> Shooting guard Bracey Wright, also 6-2, of The Colony, is one of the top
> recruits in the nation and Texas is among his leaders. The loss of Horton

> won't be a problem if Wright comes aboard. If Wright goes elsewhere,
