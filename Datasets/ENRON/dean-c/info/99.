> Freshman Hold First Workouts, Impress Coaches
>
> The Longhorns' heralded freshmen had their first pair of workouts Tuesday
> and
> coach Mack Brown and his staff said they are very pleased with their
> newest
> group of recruits.
> "They are big and fast and talented," Brown said. "We are still glad we
> recruited all of them."
> JC transfer Alfio Randall, who is being counted on to challenge for a
> starting job at offensive tackle, was held out of Tuesday's workouts
> because
> the doctors who conduct tests on all the team members said some of his
> blood
> tests need to be repeated. Brown said there was no indication from the
> doctors that there was a problem, but he said no players will work out
> until
> they have been thoroughly tested and cleared by the doctors.
> Two freshmen were nursing injuries. DB Rufus Harris of La Porte has a
sore
>
> quad muscle from one of the All-Star games and RB Anthony Johnson of
> Jefferson turned up with an old stress fracture in his foot. His injury
> probably will keep him out of action for a while, but Harris should be
> able
> to work out soon.
> Brown also said junior DE O. J. McClintock's arm and hand injuries might
> cause him to miss "about half the season," but he also said he might be
> able
> to make it back quicker than that. McClintock suffered glass cuts to his
> arm
> and hand in a household accident last week and underwent emergency
> surgery.
> With McClintock on the shelf, at least temporarily, the only two
> out-of-state
> freshmen -  Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, of Valencia, Cal., and Eric
Hall,
>
> 6-3, 240, 4.6, of Clarksville, Tenn. - were getting close looks from the
> coaches because the Horns are thin in the defensive line.
> With the players working without pads, it's difficult to tell very much,
> but
> Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese both said they like the way
> Jakes
> runs and like his athleticism. Reese also said Hall has a chance to play
> ear
> ly because of the shortage of defensive ends.
> Reese also said the class of defensive backs "is the best, as a group,
> since
> we've been here. They all have speed and the ability to cover
> man-for-man."
> Offensive coordinator Greg Davis also praised the arm strength of his
> freshman QB, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 215, 4.7, of   Dallas Bishop Lynch.
> Nordgren
> threw several passes more than 60 yards in the afternoon practice Tuesday
> and
> he threw them with some zip and good accuracy.
> The four walk-on kickers also were drawing close attention and all four
of
>
> them showed good leg strength and pretty good accuracy. They are Brady
> Noto,
> 5-10, 175, from Katy Taylor; David Pino, 5-8, 165, from Wichita Falls
> Rider;
> Dusty Mangum, 5-11, 175, from Mesquite, and James Baker, 6-0, 185, from
> Austin Westlake. Brown said he thinks all four of them have some talent
> and
> said the coaches hope one or two of them will be able to help solve the
> team's place-kicking problems.
> He said one thing that hampered all the kickers Tuesday was that none of
> the
> freshmen have experience as holders. Brian Carter, a WR/DB from The
> Woodlands, appeared to do a good job of holding in a pinch-hit role.
> Brown said some of the freshmen OLs "are going to have to drop some
> weight."
> He didn't name anyone, but William Winston of Houston Madison and
Terrance
>
> Young of Longview both appear to weigh well above 350 pounds.
> The freshmen will practice again at  9 a.m. and  5 p.m. on Wednesday. The

> varsity reports Thursday and the first full squad practice will be
> Saturday
> at 9 a.m. All the practices are open to the public.
> RECRUITING NOTES: LB Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora, one of
> the
> Longhorns' dozen early commitments, got word from Norfolk, Va., late
> Monday
> night that he had been named the outstanding male performer at the AAU
> Junior
> Olympics in Norfolk. As I reported in yesterday's e-mail/fax, he broke
his
>
> own national AAU Junior Olympic record by winning the discus with a 202-7

> throw and was second in the shot and sixth in the javelin. . . The
> Longhorns
> have commitments from DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, who is No. 3 on my
> list
> of the state's top 25 "difference makers, Robison, who is No. 17, and OL
> Brett Valdez of Brownwood, who is No. 23. They also are running No. 1
with
>
> several other members of that elite group, including No. 1 DT Rodriquie
> Wright of Alief Hastings, No. 9 LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, No. 15
> DT
> Marco Martin of Mesquite and No. 21 DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac. They
> are
> tied for the lead with some of other "difference makers," but they are
> clearly in the lead with the four I cited.
