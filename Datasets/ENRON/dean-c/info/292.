Part 2

Ford Looks Good in First Outing

Heralded freshman point guard T. J. Ford looked as good as advertised
Wednesday night in the Longhorn basketball team's annual intrasquad scrimmage.
Senior guard Fredie Williams, sophomore guard Royal Ivey and sophomore
swingman Brandon Mouton had 19 points each to lead the scoring, but Ford had
16 points and nailed a three-pointer with five seconds left to knot the score
at 75-75. Coach Rick Barnes called it a draw at that point.
The Longhorns, who tied for last in the Big 12 Conference in field goal
percentage during the 2000-01 season (.412), shot well.  Both teams connected
on better than 50 percent of their field goal attempts and three-point field
goal attempts during the scrimmage.
"Coming into the season, we knew we had to get better with our field goal
percentage," Barnes said.  "I look at the stat sheet and I know we can shoot
even better than we did tonight.  I think we are a better driving team this
year, and that penetration will help our shooting.  I was pleased with
tonight, and I really like the chemistry on this team."
The Orange team was led by Mouton and Ford, plus senior forward Chris Owens,
who scored 17 points. Ford's 16 points included four of six treys, plus eight
assists and just three turnovers.
Williams and Ivey led the White squad.  Sophomore center James Thomas had 15
points and a game-high 10 rebounds, while sophomore forward Brian Boddicker
scored 15 points (4-of-6 threes) and had seven boards.
A trio of Longhorns did not suit up for the scrimmage due to injuries,
including junior guard Terrell Ross (foot, ankle), freshman swingman Sydmill
Harris (achilles) and freshman forward/center Chris Wright (knee). Wright is
expected to redshirt this season to rehabilitate his knee. The other two
should return this season.
Texas is slated to play two home exhibition games at the Erwin Center
(Wednesday, Nov. 7 vs. Alaska Anchorage, 7 p.m.; and Tuesday, Nov. 13 vs. EA
Sports All-Stars, 7 p.m.).

Newcomers Star for Women

Freshman center-forward Mercedes Williams and sophomore guard Kaira White
scored 12 points each to lead the White to a 61-36 win over the Orange in the
annual Texas women's basketball scrimmage Tuesday.
Senior guard Asha Hill had 11 points, including a game-high three
three-pointers, and senior forward Dana Godfrey  finished with 10 points.
Sophomore center Stacy Stephens had nine rebounds to lead both teams in that
department and she also scored seven points for the White.
Senior forward Tracy Cook led the Orange team with 10 points and freshman
forward Jody Bell added seven points and six rebounds.
The White squad held a 37-30 edge in rebounding and shot 45% from the floor,
hitting 22 of 49 shots, while the Orange squad hit at a 33.3 percent clip
(16-for-48).
"It was a little shaky out there at first, but that's to be expected," coach
Jody Conradt said. "You could easily tell who the returnees were by their
solid presence on the court, whereas the freshmen looked a little tentative
and uptight."
"We are looking for our identity right now. We do want to run with the ball,
but we've got to work on pushing the ball up the court quicker, getting the
outlet passes released quicker and taking the ball out of bounds as fast as
possible."

Game Quotes . .

"We played a very talented team that is well coached and is on a roll in the
BCS mix. It hurts when you throw an interception, have a punt return, a kick
return and a bad snap that all lead to eventual touchdowns and realize your
spotting Texas 28 points.
- Baylor head coach Kevin Steele
* * * *
"Early in the ball game, the defense did what it was supposed to do. It
stopped Baylor when it had to. Then the offense did what it was supposed to
do. It started scoring touchdowns. It got a little sloppy after that, but
overall, I thought we did a good job."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"In most cases today, the run was outnumbered. We knew it would be hard, but
Cedric (Benson) did a good job for us, and we were able to get good matchups
in the passing game because they had to play Roy (Williams) and B. J.
(Johnson) and Sloan (Thomas) one on one. We ran two backs more than we have
in other games to try to get more blocking."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"I might have gained 108 yards today, but it didn't come easy. The offensive
line did a great job today. Baylor played tough all day long. I feel like the
offense is starting to get into a rhythm. Hopefully we can keep stepping it
up more each week. I'm happy with the win. Every team in the Big 12 has
talent and winning on the road isn't easy."
 - Longhorn freshman RB Cedric Benson
* * * *
"It's really competitive out there and we did a lot of things right, but we
made too many mistakes to beat a team as good as Texas."
- Baylor wide receiver Reggie Newhouse
* * * *
"I thought we were going to make more big plays, and I got a little impatient
at times. Overall, I thought the offense played well and moved the ball and
scored some points."
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
"My eyes lit up when I saw that man-for-man coverage. We've got the mentality
that nobody can cover us man for man. I respect them for trying it. We
haven't seen a lot of manh coverage this year."
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams, who had six catches for 147 yards and
a touchdown
* * * *
"It was just like being at home. I wanted everyone to know I can compete with
the older guys, and that's hard to do when you're a freshman."
- Texas freshman linebacker Derrick Johnson, talking about coming back to
Waco, where he starred for the Waco Lions, for the first time as a college
player

Scouting Kansas

Texas will host Kansas at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in the Longhorns' final home
game of the season. It will not be televised.
Texas is 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Big 12. Kansas is 2-6 overall and 1-5 in
the Big 12. As if the Jayhawks didn't have enough problems, head coach Terry
Allen got the axe Sunday and one of his assistants was named interim coach.
Kansas opened the season with a 24-10 win over Southwest Missouri, then fell
to UCLA, 41-17. The Jayhawks lost at Colorado, 27-16, before upsetting Texas
Tech in Lubbock, 34-31.
Then they lost to Oklahoma, 38-10, fell to Missouri in three overtimes,
38-34, lost to Kansas State, 40-6, and fell to Nebraska, 44-7.
A pair of Texans lead the Jayhawk offense. RB Reggie Duncan of Killeen is
their top rusher, averaging 73.5 yards per game, and QB Mario Kinsey of Waco
is averaging 106.2 yards per game in total offense.
Kinsey is a scrambler who has 190 net rushing yards this season, despite a
lot of sacks.
This Kansas team has had its moments, headed by the upset of Texas Tech in
Lubbock, but it has too little offense (109th in the country) and too little
defense (90th in the nation) to compete with Texas unless the Longhorns mess
up royally.
Look for freshman RB Cedric Benson to have a good day against a run defense
that gives up 236.3 yards a game and for QB Chris Simms and his receivers to
light up the scoreboard, too.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                    Kansas

(51)     164.7       Rushing Avg.         (91)   118.3

Longhorn Notes . .
* Texas improved to 31-0 when outrushing its opponent in the Mack Brown era.
Conversely, the Longhorns are 4-12 when outrushed by their opponents under
Brown.
* Freshman RB Cedric Benson had 108 rushing yards, giving him 682this season
and moving him  into fifth on the UT freshman list. He is the eighth player
in UT history - and the first freshman - to rush for 100 yards in four
straight games. Benson also tied Earl Campbell's freshman record for 100-yard
games in a season (4). He ran for two scores, giving him seven rushing TDs
this season. That places him fourth on the UT freshman list, one shy of the
record of eight shared by Ricky Williams, Butch Hadnot and Graylon Wyatt.
