> Williams, Benson Star as Horns Stress Running Game in First Scrimmage
>
> Sophomore  Ivan Williams, the forgotten man at Texas, and true freshman
> Cedric Benson, the guy everyone can't wait to see, were the offensive
> stars
> of the first Longhorn scrimmage of pre-season football practice Thursday
> afternoon.
> Williams had more opportunities than anyone else and he took advantage of

> them, using his 6-1, 245-pound body to run for three touchdowns, all on
> 1-yard runs, and to gain 78 yards on 10 carries.
> "Ivan really stepped up," said head coach Mack Brown. "he weighs about
245
>
> pounds and he really did a good job for us today. He showed a lot of
power

> and determination."
> Benson, the phenom from Midland Lee, had five carries for 37 yards and
> also
> went 25 yards with a swing pass from QB Chris Simms. He made four yards
on
>
> one play that looked like it would be a four-yard loss. He has a great
> combination of speed, power and cutback ability.
> "Cedric  has great quickness and great vision," Brown said. "He's a tough

> kid, too. Rufus Harris (freshman safety) really belted him on one run,
and
> he
> just hopped back up and went back to the huddle like nothing had
happened.
> He
> ran the ball a lot at Midland Lee with everybody keying on him, so he's
> already shown he's a tough runner."
> The coaches stressed the running game in the scrimmage, and Brown said
> that
> was because they had to work primarily on the passing game when they were
> in
> shorts and shells for the first several days of practice and also
because,
>
> "It's important that we have a good running game."
> He said the offense needs to make more time-consuming drives to "help
keep
>
> our defense fresh. We've got to use our offense to help our defense out
by
>
> controlling the clock a little more."
> The right side of the offensive line, with guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes and
> tackle Mike Williams, did a great job of run blocking throughout the
> scrimmage.
> Simms also had a good day passing, hitting 15 of 23 for 142 yards and a
> touchdown on a 16-yard completion to sophomore WR Sloan Thomas, who made
a
>
> great catch just before going out of bounds.
> But this was a day for running backs to shine, and starter Victor ike had
> 28
> yards on just four carries and also had a 37-yard run with a short pass.
> Redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran had 40 yards on just two carries and
> junior
> Kenny Hayter had five carries for 34 yards.
> Sophomore DB Nathan Vasher had an 82-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.
> Walk-on Mike Ungar had a 46-yard touchdown catch on a long pass from
> redshirt
> freshman QB Chance Mock.
> Senior QB Major Applewhite, working with the second-team offense
primarily
>
> against the first-team defense, competed 5 of 13 passes for 27 yards and
> sophomore safety Dakarai Pearson picked off one and would have run it in
> for
> a touchdown if the officials hadn't blown the play dead. Mock's only
> completion in three attempts was the long TD strike to Ungar.
> JC transfer Brian Bradfort\d, who appears to have nailed down the
starting
>
> punting job, had two punts, with one going 44 yards and the other going
> 43.
> On the down side, however, he did have one blocked.
> Freshman walk-on Dusty Mangum of Mesquite was the starting place kicker
> and
> he was three-for-three on field goals from 32, 46, and 26 yards out.
> The Longhorns will practice at 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. Friday at the Denius
> Fields before having a second scrimmage at 9 a.m. Saturday in Royal
> Memorial
> Stadium.
> RECRUITING NOTES: With 12 commitments already, the Longhorns are about
