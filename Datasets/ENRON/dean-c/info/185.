Brown Says No True Freshman Likely to Start, But Several Will Play Early

Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a tough 90-minute practice
Wednesday in the team's final full-scale workout before Saturday's 11:30
a.m.
opening game with Louisiana-Lafayette in Royal Memorial Stadium.
In answer to a question, he said, "We are not likely to start a (true)
freshman, but several of them will get into the game pretty quickly." WRs
Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson, DE Kalen Thornton, DT Stevie Lee and CB Nathan
Vasher are the freshmen who are most likely to see quick action.
Brown said redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway probably will start at left
guard, but he said Derrick Dockery, who had been starting before missing
some
practice because of a large cyst, will play a lot, too.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said sophomore DE Cole Pittman "has been
playing really well. If he keeps playing like he has, we'll probably move
him
over to the other end as the starter and have Jermain Anderson be a swing
guy
who can substitute at either end.
Pittman has been backing up Cory Redding at right end. He might start at
right end Saturday because Redding also has missed some practice with a
knee
sprain. But Reese said Redding and Pittman "are my two best ends right now,
so  I might move Pittman. I'm still not happy with the end play, but we'll
keep working on it." Texas has nine defensive starters back, but the two
regulars who graduated were DEs Aaron Hmphrey and Cedric Woodard.
Brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense, and he said
the
offense "seems to be developing more leadership." He also said he is
pleased
with the way the team has worked in the record heat in Austin (110 on
Monday
and 112 on Tuesday, the two hottest days on record). "They have worked
really
hard," he said. "We've cut some of the workouts a little short because of
the
heat, but they are in fine shape."
It was a little cooler in Austin Wednesday, with the high around 100, and
it
is supposed to be in the mid-to-low 90s at kickoff time Saturday.
Brown also said the team is healthy with TE Bo Scaife and WR Jamel Thompson
the only players expected to miss the game. Scaife is out for the season
after undergoing knee surgery in late August, and Thompson will miss most
or
all of the season after undergoing knee surgery following spring practice.
Brown won't name his  QB. He says he doesn't even know yet. Most observers
think it will be Chris Simms, but I think it's 50-50 between Simms and
Major
Applewhite.

RECRUITING NOTES: I'm going to Houston Friday to see Galena Park North
Shore's game with Alief Hastings. North Shore has the state's top TE, James
Moses, and one of the top LBs, Jonathan Jackson. Both are strongly
considering Texas. I usually go to half of one game and then go to half of
another game, but with that 11:30 a.m. UT kickoff Saturday morning, I'll
probably just watch half of that game, then head back to Austin. I saw
North
Shore play last year, but I want to see how Moses and Jackson look as
seniors. I'll report on it in my next newsletter. . . The state's top
safety,
Dewayne Brandon of Temple, won't get much sleep Friday night either. His
team
is going to Brownwood for a game Friday night. He's going to get home about
1
or 2 o'clock in the morning, then says he will get up in time to make it to
Austin to the Texas game. "I want to see the Longhorns play," he said.
Asked
what schools he is considering, he said, "Texas, Florida State, Nebraska,
Michigan and Colorado are the main ones." . . . The state's top DT, Tommie
Harris of Killeen Ellison, also plans to come to the game, and DE Eric Hall
of Clarksville, Tenn., is coming Saturday for his official visit.

BASEBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorn  baseball coaches already have
commitments from four top baseball players. They are catcher Jack Sweeney,
6-2, 200, of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hard-throwing
right-handed
pitchers

-  Joey Guajardo, 6-0, 190, who threw three no-hitters as a junior
at Round Rock, and  Austin Westlake aces  Chaz Taylor, 6-3, 180, and,
Huston
Street, 5-11, 180. Street, who was 6-1, with a 1.27 ERA last season,  is
the
son of former UT football and baseball star James Street. Taylor pitched a
two-hitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs, a powerful team that
included seven college players or signees, including Jason Stokes of
Coppell.
He struck Stokes out twice in that game. Stokes, a UT signee, signed a $2
million pro contract last week. Sweeney started 10 games as a freshman at
Bellaire and has been a starter ever since. He is the best defensive
catcher
in the country and also wields a powerful bat.
