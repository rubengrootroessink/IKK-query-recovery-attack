Horns Get Super Wide Receiver

Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in Champaign,
Illinois, the big, fast, tough wide receiver the Longhorns have been
recruiting for months, committed to UT Sunday.
Johnson, a national top 100 prospect and one of the top wide receivers in the
country, took his official visit to Texas this weekend and said he committed
to UT head coach Mack Brown before returning home.
Texas assistant coach Tim Brewster did an outstanding recruiting job with
Johnson, who listed Texas No. 1 throughout the recruiting process.
Johnson said he picked the Longhorns because "I love their offense. They
really run a pro-type offense. It's a dream offense for a wide receiver."
Johnson is the 15th early commitment for Texas and is the ninth one who is
listed on one or more national top 100 teams.
The other eight recruits who have been listed on top national teams are DE
Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel; LB Garnett Smith, 6-3,
221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast
JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270,
4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral,
the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;  OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4,
310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of Allen;  and TE
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;
Davis made all of the top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT  Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
DB Matthew Melton of Tyler John Tyler had planned to come to Texas on an
unofficial visit last weekend, but was not able to make it. He told me he is
planning to commit to Texas soon.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Super QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 200, 4.4, of Houston Madison
says his top two teams right now are Texas and Miami. Young is one of the
nation's top quarterback prospects. He also is an outstanding basketball
player, but wants to concentrate on football in college. . . The
Texas-Oklahoma game Saturday will be a big factor in deciding where several
top recruits go, including OL Justin Blalock of Plano East, DE Larry Dibbles
of Lancaster, LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and DE Bryan Pickryl of
Jenks, Oklahoma. All of them are national top 100 recruits. . . I have moved
Lufkin QB Reggie McNeal to the Athlete category on my Blue Chip list on page
2. He is a great athlete with tremendous speed. I saw him play when Lufkin
hosted Shreveport Evangel and think he is one of the state's top prospects,
but might wind up at wide receiver or defensive back in college. I usually
don't explain moves like this, but he is an Aggie commitment and many of the
A&M gurus always move Longhorn signees down in their rankings when they
commit to Texas. I still have McNeal ranked very high, but have changed his
projected position. . . WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus has played
very little high school football because of transfers and disciplinary
problems, but he is a great athlete who would be on all the national lists if
he had played as much as the other top guys. He is very interested in Texas
and other top schools, but many of them are waiting to see how he fares for
the rest of the season - on the field and in the citizenship area - before
pulling the trigger on an offer. . . RB Selvin Young of Jersey Village is
opening some eyes again this season. He was sensational in rushing for more
than 2,000 yards as a sophomore, but was hampered by an ankle injury
throughout his junior year.

Horns No. 5 in Polls

Texas stayed at the No. 5 in both major national polls this week and Oklahoma
remained No. 3, setting up a big battle Saturday in Dallas.

Key Statistics

Tech's outstanding RB Ricky Williams had a 31-yard run for the Raiders' only
score, but he had four other carries for just 11 yards and he had nine pass
receptions for only 15 yards. The Longhorns accomplished that with a swarming
defense that usually had one linebacker with just one assignment - tackle
Williams.

Scouting Oklahoma

The Longhorns will find out just how far they have progressed this season
when they meet the ultimate measuring stick - Oklahoma - Saturday in Dallas.
The game is at 2:30 p.m. and will televised over most of the nation by ABC.
Oklahoma, the defending national champion, gleefully provided the lowest ebb
in the Longhorns' season last year with a 63-14 drubbing.
Texas rebounded from that debacle and went on to a 9-3 season But this is the
year the Longhorns have been working toward since the arrival of coach Mack
Brown and his staff.
For the first time, they have three straight outstanding recruiting classes
and their play so far this season indicates the really might finish in the
top 10 nationally for the first time since 1983.
Saturday's game with OU will either solidly entrench the Longhorns in the
upper part of the top 10, or it will send them plummeting, at least
temporarily, once again.
The Sooners won a big one last week, edging powerful Kansas State, 38-37, in
Norman.
OU QB Nate Hybl has completed 79 of 138 passes (57.25%) for 946 yards and six
touchdowns, with six interceptions. He is averaging 236.5 yards a game
through the air.
RB Quentin Griffin and WR Antwone Savage are the other two members of the
Sooners' big three offensively. The Sooners are running more this year and
Griffin is averaging 92 yards per game rushing. He also is one of Hybl's
favorite pass receivers.
Savage, who turned an ankle late in the K-State game, had two long scoring
plays against the Wildcats' tough defense and he also threw a touchdown pass
on a trick play.
Defensively, the Sooners are very solid and very opportunistic. LB Rocky
Calmus is adept at scoring defensive touchdowns.
To win, the Longhorns must:
1. Get another good, balanced performance from the offense.
2. Play outstanding defense and keep the Sooners guessing on offense.
3. Avoid giving Oklahoma any defensive touchdowns.
4. Play four tough quarters.
