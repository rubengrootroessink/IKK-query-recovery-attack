DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 265, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (UT, LSU)

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, and I think they will get another
one Sunday when outstanding DE Chase Pittman attends church services at
Shreveport Evangel.
It is a tradition at Evangel that recruits announce their college plans to
the congregation.
Pittman might commit to LSU instead of Texas, but I think he is going to be a
Longhorn.
He and his parents were in Austin over the weekend and participated in
pre-game ceremonies honoring the memory of his brother, Cole, who was killed
in a traffic accident in February while returning to UT for spring football
practice.
He visited LSU the previous week and has narrowed his choices to the
Longhorns and Bayou Bengals.
While Pittman was not on an official visit (he and his parents paid their own
way), his teammate, speedy DB Jonathan Wade, 5-11, 185, 4.3, was on an
official visit.
Wade, a 10.3 sprinter, committed to Tennessee several weeks ago, but he must
be having second thoughts. He says he remains firmly committede to the
Volunteers, but you know what I have always said about kids who keep on
visiting after they commit.
In case you are a new subscriber, I say that is akin to keeping on dating
after you become engaged, which makes marriage rather doubtful.
WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., has not made it to a Texas game, as he
had planned to do, but he says the Longhorns still are his No. 1 choice.
He does say he has changed his mind about committing early and wants to look
around a little.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is the closest thing I've seen  this year
to super Longhorn freshman Derrick Johnson.
He told me Sunday he probably will announce his college choice right after he
attends the Texas-Oklahoma game.
He leans the Longhorns' way pretty strongly, but I think he might swing the
other way if the Sooners win that game.
"I really like Texas, but I want to see how those teams look when they play
each other," he said.
If the Longhorns can sign Smith and Aaron Harris, the stud middle backer at
North Mesquite, they will be a lot better at linebacker in future years when
they team with the young guys already on campus.
