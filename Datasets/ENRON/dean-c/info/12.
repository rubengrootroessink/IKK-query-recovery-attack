Barnes Signs Top JC Guard

A junior college combo guard has signed a National Letter
of Intent to play basketball next season at The University of Texas, head
coach Rick Barnes announced Monday morning.
Terrell Ross (Laurel, Md./Allegany College) will join the Longhorns and have
two years of eligibility remaining beginning with the 2001-02 campaign.
"Terrell is a versatile player with good size who can
help our backcourt play in many ways," Barnes said.  "He handles the ball
and sees the floor well, can score and defend, and is a good worker.  The
most attractive thing about Terrell is that he comes from one of the most
storied junior college programs in the nation and received great coaching
while at Allegany."
Ross (6-4, 190), the starting point guard for the past two years under
legendary coach Bob Kirk at Allegany College (Cumberland, Md.), averaged
9.3 points, 7.7 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game while earning first-team
NJCAA (National Junior College Athletic Association) Division I All-America
and first-team All-Region XX honors during his sophomore season.  He led
the Trojans to an overall record of 32-3 and a runner-up finish at the
NJCAA Division I Championship this past year.  Ross converted 52.2% of his
field goals, 33.8% (20-of-59) from three-point range and 74.3% (81-of-109)
from the free throw line as a sophomore.
In his freshman campaign, Ross helped Allegany to a 28-2 record and a No. 3
ranking in the final NJCAA Division I poll.  He averaged 8.1 points, 7.5
assists (2.92 assist-to-turnover ratio) and 5.1 rebounds per game while
hitting 63.1% of his field goals and 47.2% (17-of-36) from three-point
range during his freshman year.  Ross received honorable mention NJCAA
Division I All-America and first-team All-Region XX accolades.
Ross joins a duo of fall signees on the Longhorns roster:  T.J. Ford
(Houston, Texas) and Chris Wright (Redwater, Texas).  UT will also gain the
services of junior walk-on forward Deginald Erskin (Gonzalez, Texas) who
sat out the 2000-01 campaign under NCAA transfer rules but was allowed to
practice with the team.
