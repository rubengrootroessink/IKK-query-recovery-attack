 Most Football Forecasters Rank Longhorns
High Nationally, See OU Game as Key to Season

Most of the good national football magazines are out and so is the one that
serves as an every-year staple for fans in Texas - Dave Campbell's Texas
Football - and all of them agree on two things:
1. The Longhorns are going to be very good this 2001 season, with coach Mack
Brown's most talented team at Texas poised to claim its place among the
nation's elite once again.
2. Defending national champion Oklahoma is going to be very good, too, so
mark October 6 on your calendar and plan to be in Dallas on that date for the
clash of Big 12 South titans.
With apologies to the other Big 12 South teams, I think the Longhorns and the
Sooners will be so far above their division rivals that the winner of that
October 6 Dallas showdown will win the Southern Division and have a chance
for national honors.
The Longhorns have other dangerous games, and so do the Sooners, but it's
hard to see either of them stumbling more than once when they aren't playing
each other, so look for the Cotton Bowl winner to emerge as a big player on
the national scene.
Of course, as Longhorn fans know exceeedingly well, to their chagrin, bad
things happen quite often through the course of a season.
Remember Stanford last year and North Carolina State the year before? Of
course you do. We all do. They are sad memories for all Longhorns.
But Brown's teams have also won great victories - over Nebraska twice in
three tries, Oklahoma twice in three years and A&M twice in three seasons,
plus a decisive Cotton Bowl victory over Mississippi State and Jackie
Sherrill.
Brown's first team at Texas went 9-3 after a 1-2 start and Ricky Williams won
the Heisman Trophy. Coming on the heels of a 4-7 team that ended the John
Mackovic era, it was an impressive start  for the Brown era.
His second team at Texas was rolling along at 9-2 when its wide receivers
started getting nicked and then the best one (Kwame Cavil) got suspended. It
lost its final three games to wind up 9-5, but it was a very good team until
those last three  games.
When you only have three good wide receivers and two of them get hurt and the
third one misses the bowl game, it's tough to operate successfully when you
are primarily a passing team.
Some fans were disappointed in that 1999 team, and it is understandably
disheartening to lose three games to close the season, but those 1999
Longhorns did some very good things like handing Nebraska its only loss,
rallying from a 17-0 deficit to beat Bob Stoops' first Oklahoma team and
hammering Stanford, 69-17. That Stanford team went on to win the Pac 10 and
earn a Rose Bowl berth.
Brown's third team at Texas was last year's unit, which finished 9-3.
Frankly, when I saw superb young TE Bo Scaife go down with a season-ending
knee injury during two-a-days, I would have settled for 7-4.
The Longhorns had only three scholarship tight ends and the other two also
suffered injuries that ended their seasons.
And that wasn't all. DT Shaun Rogers missed some games and was never at full
speed after an early season injury. Ditto for both starting guards - Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and Derrick Dockery.
Then there was the so-called quarterback controversy. It really wasn't that
much of a controversy because Major Applewhite simply didn't look like the
same great quarterback after his knee injury and Chris Simms simply didn't
have enough experience to play well early in the year.
I think the coaches were just trying to find one quarterback who could play
at a winning level, not playing some game with their quarterbacks.
Neither quarterback played as well last season as the pre-injury Applewhite,
but Simms did improve as the season progressed and he is the unquestioned No.
1 guy heading into this season.
There were two reasons for this brief review of Mack Brown's three seasons at
Texas.
The first was to say three nine-win seasons in a row with the kind of
problems that hit the team in 1999 and 2000 are pretty remarkable and all
Longhorn fans should be thanking their lucky stars every day that the leaders
of a school that would hire John Mackovic would get smart enough to hire Mack
Brown the next time around.
The second was to say that injuries, while always a point of concern,
shouldn't be quite as worrisome this season because the superb recruiting
classes Brown and his staff have signed will be three deep this season. He
actually will have four classes on campus, but he got a late start his first
year and his first class was good, but not great. The last three have been
great.
There are some questions to be answered, particularly at running back, but
there are talented players at virtually every position, and that is something
now many college teams can say.
The receiving corps, including the wide receivers and tight ends, will be the
best in the Big 12 and maybe in the country and the secondary might be the
best in the Big 12, too, although Oklahoma fans and coaches would dispute
that.
If Simms is the best passer in the league, as all the football magazines
attest, and if Cedric Benson is as good as we all think, look out everyone
because the Longhorns will be for real.
Don't worry about all that talk about our defensive tackles. The Big 12 is a
passing league and these tackles are quick to the passer.
But you should worry some about the place kicking. Unless one of the
returnees gets better or one of the walk-ons steps up, the same thing that
knocked Bobby Bowden out of a couple of national titles at Florida State
could jump up and bite the Longhorns.

Benson Will Mix Football, Baseball; Cosby Drops Football

Two super Longhorn recruits have signed pro baseball contracts, but only one
of them - and it is not Cedric Benson - is giving up college football to
concentrate on professional football.
Benson, who led Midland Lee to three straight Class 5A state titles,  signed
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he signed a contract like the one Ricky
Williams signed out of high school.
It lets him play college football and use pro baseball as a highly paid
summer job.
"I want to play college football at Texas," Benson said. "Someday I want to
play both sports professionally, but I want to play college football first."
But Mart's Quan Cosby, a nationally recruited athlete who was ticketed to
play wide receiver at Texas, signed a five-year baseball contract with the
California Angels and said his football playing days are over.
It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other
Longhorns. You just don't expect a sixth-round draft choice to get enough
money to give up football.
But Cosby told me he got close to first-round money. "I told them what it
would take for me to give up football, and that's what they came up with," he
said, but he declined to give a hint about his signing bonus.
Cosby said baseball is "easier on the body, so I probably will be able to
play baseball longer than I could have played football."
Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career
doesn't work out as planned, he said, "That's a possibility, but I'm figuring
on playing baseball for a long time."
