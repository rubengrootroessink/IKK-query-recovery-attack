 Earl Anderson Commits to Horns; Lyle Sendlein Poised to Come Aboard

 Earl Anderson of San Marcos, the quickest big DT I've seen this year, says
 he
 has committed to Texas unofficially and will make it official Sunday when
 he
 comes to the Longhorns' first mini-camp.
 Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral, another big DT prospect who is so
 fast
 he plays middle linebacker at his school, told me he also plans to commit
 at
 Sunday's camp "if they offer me a  scholarship." Don't worry, Lyle, your
 scholarship will be waiting for you.
 When Anderson and Sendlein commit officially on Sunday, it will give the
 Longhorns the lead in early recruiting in the Big 12 and start them on the

 way to a fourth straight top five national recruiting class.
 Anderson is the highest ranked Texas blue-chipper to pick a college. He is

 No. 3 on my 25-man "difference-maker" list, and Texas also has a
 commitment
 from OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood, who is No. 23 on that list. Sendlein is
 the
 top recruit in Arizona and, if he lived in Texas, he would be high in my
 top
 25.
 Anderson, who says he has grown an inch to 6-4 and now weighs 275, told me

 can still break 4.8 in the 40 on most days. "I ran a 4.78 the last time I
 was
 clocked," he said. "I want to stay below 4.8, so I'm watching my weight
 now."
 I was the first guy to give him a high ranking after seeing his incredible

 quickness last season.
 He said he picked Texas over Texas A&M, Florida State and others because
 UT
 "has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and it's
 so
 close that my parents won't have to spend a lot of money traveling around
 to
 see me play."
 Besides that, he said, "I've always been a Longhorn fan."
 Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother
 is
 named Austin. Their father, Robin, was a great linebacker at Texas and
 also
 played in the NFL for many years. He said he is 6-5, 275, and can run the
 40
 in 4.85. His Scottsdale team has gone 14-0 two straight years and his
 prowess
 as a defender is one of the main reasons for the team's success.
 Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus
 Notre
 Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
 Coach Mack Brown said one of the Longhorns' top recruiting goals this year

 was to sign several top defensive linemen, and, while he can't comment on
 individual recruits,  Anderson and Sendlein are top-notch defensive line
 prospects.
 Another great defensive line prospect, Chase Pittman of Shreveport
 Evangel,
 came in at 6-4 1/2 and 261 and ran a 4.8 40 at a Nike camp at LSU
 recently,
 and he also bench pressed 185 pounds 36 times. No one else at the camp was

 able to bench press 185 pounds more than 22 times. Pittman bench pressed
 440
 pounds, a tremendous achievement for a high school junior, at a recent
 charity fund raising event at Evangel.
 He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman, the former UT defensive linemen

 who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning
 to
 Texas for spring training. He is considering Texas, LSU and Oklahoma.
 CB Donald Burgs of Houston Madison plans to come to the second UT
 mini-camp
 on June 10, and there is a good chance he will commit to the Longhorns. He
 is
 a big Texas fan who is No. 15 on my "difference-maker" list.

 FOOTBALL NOTES: A columnist for the Sporting News has picked Texas No. 1.
 I
 like his sentiments and I think the Longhorns will be one of the nation's
 elite teams this season, but it's tough to go all the way when you have to

 win your division of the Big 12, beat a team like Nebraska or Kansas State
 in
 the league championship game and then tame someone like Florida State or
 Miami in the Rose Bowl. Texas could do it, but so could several other
 teams.
 Darrell Royal won three national titles at Texas, but I always thought his

 1964 team might have been his best one. Bear Bryant probably thought so,
 too,
 because it beat his national championship Alabama team and Joe Namath in
 the
 Orange Bowl, but a one-point loss at Arkansas kept the Horns from
 repeating
 as national champs. The point of that flashback is that a team can be
 very, v
 ery good and still not win the national title.
