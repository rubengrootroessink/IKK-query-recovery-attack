QB-Athlete Kendal Briles Becomes Horns' 10th Commitment

No other state has  two players who produced almost 8,000 yards and nearly
100 touchdowns between them  last season, but Texas does, and UT has picked
up a commitment from one of them and has a good chance to get a pledge from
the other one this weekend.
QB Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, of Wollforth Frenship, said he called
coach
Mack Brown late Tuesday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.
Briles led Stephenville to the Class 4A State Championship last year, but
moved to the Lubbock area when his father, Art Briles, who coached
Stephenville to three perfect 16-0 seasons and state titles in the '90s,
took
an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech.
"I called coach Brown last night and told him I was committing," Briles
said.
"I have always liked Texas. They have a great academic reputation and I'm
excited about playing for the Longhorns."
Briles was the Class 4A offensive player of the year and it is easy to
understand why when you look at his statistics. All he did last year
offensively was complete 207 of 356 passes for 3,115 yards and 28
touchdowns
and use his quick feet to run for 1,331 more yards and 16 more TDs. That's
an
incredible 4,446 yards of offense and an equally incredible 44 touchdowns.
The other half of that prolific duo is RB Cedric Benson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, of
Midland Lee, who ran for a Class 5A record 3,526 yards and another record
51
touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State
Championship.
Benson is flying to Austin Saturday  with his mother to meet with the UT
coaches. He is a long-time UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college
this summer so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season.
I asked him if he will commit to Texas this weekend. He replied, "Maybe.
We'll see."
Benson also told me he runs a consistent 4.4 40 on grass and has run a 4.3
on
a track.
When you add their junior statistics, it comes out to 7,972 yards and 95
touchdowns. I don't think there have ever been two players in the Texas
high
school ranks, even in six-man footballs, where yardage and touchdowns are
the
name of the game, who have ever had offensive totals like that in a single
season. Class 5A and Class 4A include the largest schools in Texas, and
seasons like they had as juniors never happen  in those classifications.
Benson rushed for more than 2,000 yards his sophomore year in Lee's 15-1
championship season and led the Rebels to a perfect 16-0 season in 1999.
Briles, who became the Longhorns' 10th early commitment, turned down an
offer
to be an option quarterback at Nebraska to be a safety at Texas. He
attended
summer camps at both schools before selecting the Longhorns. It was a wise
choice if he wants a chance to play in the NFL. There are some starting
5-10
defensive backs in the NFL, but there are no starting 5-10 quarterbacks.
The Longhorns other commitments include MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen
Ellison,
OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan
Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman
Reeves
of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of
Blinn
JC and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The
Woodlands.

QB Quon Cosby of Mart is another 5-10 signal caller who will move to the
defensive backfield in college. He visited Texas last Wednesday and talked
to
Brown and several UT assistant coaches. He said the Longhorn coaches
offered
him a scholarship and told him they want him to be a cornerback and kick
returner. In leading Mart to the Class 2A state title last year, Cosby
passed
for 1,328 yards and 17 TDs, ran for 1,510 yards and 27 scores and had nine
kick returns for TDs. That's 53 TDs for this explosive young man, who lists
Texas No. 1.

UT junior center Chris Mihm was the No. 7 pick in the NBA draft Wednesday
by
the Chicago Bulls, who then swapped him to Cleveland for No. 8 pick Jamal
Crawford of Michigan and an undisclosed amount of money. The Bulls had two
of
the first seven picks in the draft. They had been expected to pick Mihm No.
4, but they went instead for Big 12 Player of the Year Marcus Fizer of Iowa
State. Forward Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati was the No. 1 pick by the New
York
Nets, followed by LSU forward Stromile Swife at No. 2 by the Vancouver
Grizzlies. The Los Angeles Clippers picked third and took East St. Louis
high
school star Darius Miles. Picking fifth, Orlando chose Florida forward Mike
Miller, and Atlanta took DerMarr Johnson, another Cincinnati player, at No.
6.
