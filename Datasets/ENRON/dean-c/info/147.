Beltran Qualifies, but Sonny Davis Headed to Junior College

RB Sneezy Beltran of Abilene told me today (Monday) he made a qualifying
score of 18 on the ACT, but the mother of DT Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier
told me her son did not qualify and is heading to Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi to play football for the next two years.
Beltran is a good student who almost qualified on his first try at the ACT,
but he said he operates best under pressure and he proved it by waiting
until
the last possible date to take it again. He is a full qualifier now and
gives
the Longhorns 19 incoming scholarship recruits.
Texas actually has 22 freshmen who have never redshirted on scholarship,
but
three of them (DT Stevie Lee and S Phillip Geiggar, both of Shreveport
Evangel, and FB Tyrone Richardson of Clarksville) enrolled last January, so
only 19 scholarship freshmen will be reporting next month for the first
time.
In addition to Davis, the Longhorns lost DT Marcel Moses of Texas City to
Kilgore JC. Both Davis and Moses say they plan to come back to UT in two
years after they graduate from junior college.
Lee looked like a future star in spring training, but Texas really needs to
sign some more defensive tackles because All-American Casey Hampton and
All-Big 12 Shaun Rogers are both heading into their senior seasons. The
defensive tackle position in the Texas high school ranks is a true good
news,
bad news story this year. The good news is that Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison is as good a DT prospect as there is in the country and he is a
strong Texas lean. The bad news is that there is no one else even close to
him in the entire state. So, if the Horns get Harris, they will have snared
a
great DT, but, if they don't, they sure will need to get one who can play
as
a true freshman the following year.
RB Cedric Benson  of Midland Lee, who ran for a Class 5A record 3,526 yards
and another record 51 touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their
second straight State Championship, had to cancel his unofficial visit to
Texas last weekend. He and his mother had planned to fly to Austin
Saturday,
but they were flying standby and got bumped by the holiday traffic. He said
he will come to Austin later this month or in early Augusut to meet with
the
Texas coaches.
He is a long-time UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college this
summer
so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season. He told me might
commit
to the Longhorns when he takes his unofficial visit.

The Longhorns' chances at getting C Greg Barnum of Killeen Ellison are not
as
bright as they were earlier. He likes Texas, but don't believe those
internet
rumors that he has been accepted by the UT admissions office. Barnum was
supposed to be the anchor of Tennessee's offensive line this season, but he
quit the team several weeks ago.
Vol  coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release him. Under Fulmer, the Vols
have one of the worst graduation rates in the college ranks. Barnum was a
good high school student, but few Vol players could meet the academic
requirements to transfer to Texas, and that might be a stumbling block for
Barnum. (If I read this on the internet, I can't be as frank on academic
matters in future e-mails!!!)
* * * *
Texas has 10 early commitments, including QB/DB Kendal Briles of Frenship,
MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who
switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson
of
Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston
Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC and DBs Braden Johnson of
Euless
Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
* * * *
The UT n baseball coaches have signed left-handed pitcher Brantley Jordan,
6-0, 190, of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock McNeil. Jordan was
11-0
last season with a 1.1 ERA in conference play and a 2-4 ERA overall. He has
a
90 mph fast ball and a very good curve ball to go along with excellent
control.
* * * *
Long-time UT tennis coach Dave Snyder has retired. Let's hope the UT brass
will hire his former top assistant, Dwayne Hultquist, to succeed him.
Hultquist, currently the head tennis coach at Florida State, is a great
recruiter who can do great things at Texas if he gets the chance.

My next fax will be whenever events warrant.
