>
> LB Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of Pflugerville Connally, committed to
the

> His parents are both Texas Tech graduates and his father, Rufus, was a

> But Monzingo also said Myers' future is at linebacker because "he's got a

> whole
> package to be an outstanding linebacker."
> He had 73 tackles last year, and Monzingo said he expects him to be even
> better this year. Monzingo said Myers played inside linebacker in a
> four-linebacker set last year, and will play middle linebacker in a
> three-linebacker set this season. "We think we need an extra defensive
> back
> because off all the passing teams we play, and Marcus is a big, physical
> linebacker who we think can hold down the middle for us, so we're going
to

> Myers also is a fine student. He has a 4.5 on a 5.0 scale, ranks in the
