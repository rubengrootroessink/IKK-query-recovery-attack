>  The Texas-Houston football game at Houston on Sept. 22 has been set for

> Longhorn fans because the Cougars' athletic director has insisted on

> the game at Robertson Stadium, which has very limited seating capacity in

> 30,000 range.
> That means Texas' first three games will be televised, with Fox

> the Sept. 1 opener in Austin at 6 p.m. against New Mexico State and ABC
> televising the Sept. 8 Austin game against North Carolina at 11 a.m. That
> 11

> UT basketball coach Rick Barnes announced Wednesday something I announced
> in
> a fax last Thursday  - Sydmill Harris, a 6-6, 190-pound shooting guard
for
>
> The Netherlands National Team, has committed to Texas and will be
eligible
>
> this season.
> Harris, who is attending summer school in Austin already, averaged 7.5
> points
> in his first season with the Dutch National Team after leading the Dutch
> Junior National Team in scoring for four straight seasons.
> "Sydmill comes here with the reputation as a solid outside shooter,"
> Barnes
> said. "He's a very mature and intelligent young man, both in the
classroom
>
> and on the basketball court. Sydmill was looking for a college program in
> the
> U. S. where he could contribute immediately and continue to learn  and
> grow
> as a basketball player. He'll definitely find that here at Texas."
> Barnes said Harris hit 34.5% (38 of 110) of his trey attempts last
season,
>
> noting that the international three-point line is at 20 feet, 6.1 inches,

> which is slightly deeper than the NCAA's 19-9 arc.
> Longhorn players who have been working out with Harris report he lives up
> to
> his reputation as a super shooter with outstanding range.
> Harris is a good pickup for the Horns, who lost both super shooting
guards
> in
> Texas to out-of-state schools. Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill chose Michigan
> and
> Bracey Wright of The Colony announced earlier this wee that he has
> narrowed
> his choices to five out-of-state schools.
> Another outstanding shooter, Lakeland, Florida's 6-5 swingman Rashad
> Anderson, led his Tallahassee Wildcats to a 69-36 route of the two-time
> defending champion Fort Worth Lions in the championship game of the Great

> America Shootout in Denton Monday. He says Texas is his top choice right
> now.
> "I like it here and Texas told me they need a two (shooting) guard," he
> said,
> adding that he also is considering Temple, Florida State, Connecticut and
> St.
> John's. He hit four three-pointers in the first half to help Tallahassee
> blow
> out the Fort Worth team and take a 30-8 lead at intermission. He finished

> with 18 points to lead all scorers in the game.

> Junior reserve DE Adam McConathy has been released from his scholarship

> RECRUITING ROUNDUP: Super WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Illinois, says

> will take an unofficial visit to Texas this weekend. He said he and a
> friend
> are going to "take a few days of vacation and come to Austin." He said he

> still favors Texas, despite never having visited the state, "because I
> really
> like the offense they run." If the Longhorns can land Johnson and Robert
> Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus, the top WR in Texas, they probably won't
> sign
> any other receivers because they already have a commitment from WR Dustin

> Miksch of Round Rock Westwood. The Longhorns still have 11 commitments,
> including six guys who have been on one or more national top 100 lists.
