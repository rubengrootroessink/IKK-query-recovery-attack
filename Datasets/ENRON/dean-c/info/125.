Thank you baby!  You're so sweet!

I just got to school.  I'm gonna study until test time.  I'm also going
to call a few day spa places and set up an appointment for my mom for
mother's day.

I can't believe it's Friday!  The days are all mixed up for me.  Last
week was so wonderful with you.  It feels like I was on a long
vacation.  It was weird taking a shower in my own shower again and going
to sleep in my own bed.

Anyway, have a good day at work.  If I get bored studying, I'll email
you again!

Love you,
Jenn
