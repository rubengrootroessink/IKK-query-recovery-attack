> Dockery Training at Tackle; Sendlein Moves to Defensive Line
>
> With three experienced offensive guards and only one experienced
offensive
>
> tackle, the Longhorn coaches moved junior guard Derrick Dockery to  left
> tackle Tuesday, and head coach Mack Brown said he will be cross trained
at
>
> both guard and tackle.
> Redshirt freshman middle linebacker Austin Sendlin, who was running
second
>
> team behind starter De'Andre Lewis, was moved to defensive tackle
Tuesday.
> Junior college All American Alfio Randall might win the starting job at
> offensive left tackle, but even if that happens, the coaches will have
> only
> five players they feel they can count on two play the four guard and
> tackle
> spots. Senior Mike Williams is an All-America candidate at right tackle
> and
> senior Antwan Kirk-Hughes is very solid at right guard. Sophomore Tillman

> Holloway started several games at left guard last year and played well.
> Holloway and Dockery had been expected to battle for the starting job at
> left
> guard, but the cross-training of Dockery could mean he will start at
> tackle
> and provide relief at guard when Randall is in the game
> Brown said the coaches would like to have three tackles and three guards
> to
> alternate, but he said they can get by with five for the two positions if
> one
> of them is cross trained and there are no injuries.
> Moving Sendlein to defensive tackle opens a second-team spot at middle
> linebacker, but defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Maurice Wilkins, a
> former linebacker who has been moved to defensive end, could be pulled
> back
> and used at middle backer if Lewis gets hurt or needs a breather. He also

> said redshirt freshman Rashad Thomas might make a good backup in the
> middle.
> Wilkins and another former linebacker, Reed Boyd, were moved to defensive
> end
> after O. J. McClintock, who was the backup at both end spots, suffered
> severe
> cuts to his right arm and hand in a household accident. McClintock is
> expected to miss the first two or three games.

> Brown said the plan at quarterback this year with junior starter Chris
> Simms,
> senior backup Major Applewhite and redshirt freshman Chance Mock "is to
> win
> the game with Chris and Major, then use Chance. We hope we have some
games
>
> where we can use all three."
> Applewhite, who holds most school passing and total offense records, has
> been
> hampered by severe injuries to both his knees, but he has been looking a
> lot
> sharper in the pre-season than he did during spring football practice.
> Brown said Simms is the clear starter, but he said the coaches have great

> confidence in both Simms and Applewhite.
> * * * *
> He also said senior linebackers Lewis and Everick Rawls "have been really

> good players for us, but we need somebody to step up and have a great
year
> in
> there."
> He said the other senior linebacker starter, former safety Lee Jackson,
is
> an
> outstanding player who really "is still a safety, but is just playing
> closer
> to the line." He said the coaches decided to move Jackson to linebacker
> because they play so many passing teams that it helps to have a
linebacker
>
> with experience as a defensive back and because Jackson is a fine tackler
> and
> outstanding blitzer.
> True freshman RB Cedric Benson explodes into the line quicker than any of
> the
> veteran running backs, and true freshman LB Derrick Johnson is the
fastest
>
> linebacker on the team. True freshman DT Kaelen Jakes continues to
impress
> in
> the pass-rushing drills. He is super quick and has great moves to put on
> the
> offensive linemen.

> RECRUITING NOTES: The state's top running back, Albert Hardy of Galena
> Park,
> came to a Longhorn practice last week and now he is listing Texas as his
> favorite team again. He had moved LSU ahead of the Horns briefly after an

> unofficial visit to Baton Rouge, but the Longhorns moved out front again
> after his trip to Austin. . . Glenn Jackson, a fine outside linebacker
> prospect who also plays defensive end at Carrollton Turner, is about 6-2
> and
> 220 and has the frame to add 10 or 15 pounds and become a pass-rusher
> deluxe
> in college with his 4.6 speed and sure tackling skills. He and Garnett
> Smith
> of Arlington Lamar are both being recruited by Texas and most other top
> schools because they are very fast, very sure tacklers and both have
> frames
> that will let them grow into big linebackers or medium-sized defensive
> ends.
