is

future.

else

> If sophomore WR Roy Williams has a great year, don't be surprised if he
> opts

> after
> their junior years, but I don't think the NCAA or the NFL would risk a

> The Longhorn freshmen wrapped up their workouts Wednesday, and coach Mack

> Brown said he is very pleased with their progress.
> The freshmen worked out twice Tuesday and twice Wednesday. With the
> varsity
> reporting Thursday, the next workouts will be Saturday at 9 a.m. and 7
> p.m.
> and they will involve the entire team.
> It's too early to say which freshmen can help this year, but DL Kaelen
> Jakes
> of Valencia, California, has some moves to get by blockers that I haven't

> seen at Texas since Aaron Humphrey was here. He looks like a guy who
could
>
> really help alleviate the shortage of defensive linemen. At 6-5 and 253
> and
> with an explosive start, he's big enough to play tackle and fast enough
to

> play end.
> Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Jakes has a chance to help quickly
> "because we need somebody to help in the defensive line and he looks like
> he
> has the tools and the temperament to do it."
> The four freshmen walk-on kickers continued competing Wednesday and, so
> far,
> it looks like David Pino of Wichita Falls Rider and Brady Noto of Katy
> Taylor, are the most accurate place kickers, while Dusty Mangum of
> Mesquite
> might have the strongest leg.
> All the kickers tried field goals from about 39 yards and then about 49
> yards. Pino and Noto were the only ones who made a fair percentage from
> the
> greater distance. Of course, they get harder to make when defenders are
> trying to block them, so a lot will depend on how the young kickers
> respond
> to pressure. Pino also got off some long, high punts, and Brown said he
> was
> impressed that Pino was able to do both jobs with such proficiency.
> JC transfer Alfio Randall, who is being counted on to challenge for a
> starting job at offensive tackle, finally was cleared for workouts
> Wednesday
> and participated in the afternoon drill. He had to have some blood tests
> redone because the first ones weren't productive.
> Three freshmen were limping Wednesday and were held out of the drills. DB

> Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes  (sprained ankle), DB Rufus Harris
of
> La
> Porte (sore quad muscle) and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferson (stress
> fracture
> in foot) couldn't practice, but Brown said he hopes Griffin and Harris
> will
> be able to work out when the team practices again on Saturday.
> Brown also said Eric Hall, 6-3, 240, of Clarksville, Tennessee, who had
> been
> ticketed for a try at fullback, "wants to play defensive end, so that's
> where
> he'll start out." He also said Brian Carter, 5-11, 185, of The Woodlands,

> wants to play wide receiver and will remain at that spot for now. He also

> could be a defensive back.

> Walk-on WR Kyle Shanahan, who is expected to be one of the team's top

but
