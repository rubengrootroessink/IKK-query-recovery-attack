UT-OU Set for 11 A.M. ABC Kickoff; Brown Laments Injured Tackles

The Texas-Oklahoma game in Dallas has been selected for an ABC telecast and
will begin at 11 a.m. on October 7. I told you several weeks ago I thought
that would happen, and now it is official. It won't go to the entire
nation,
but it will go to more than just a normal regional. It is what they call a
"split national game," which means that game and another game will divide
the
nation's viewing, presumably on close to a 50-50 basis.
If you can't make the game and want to watch it on TV, I would suggest you
call your cable company to see if they are carrying the UT-OU game. If you
are in the lower half of the country, the chances are pretty good that it
will be on in your area.

Coach Mack Brown said at his Monday news conference freshman WR Roy
Williams
"should be ready to play this week and all the others are questionable."
Williams suffered a bruised arm early in the game, and Brown said he is
feeling good enough to practice when the team resumes drills on Tuesday.
But he said DT Shawn Rogers, who suffered a sprained ankle, is among those
who are questionable, along with two other DTs, Stevie Lee (foot) and Ryan
Haywood (shoulder). "We are really thin at defensive tackle," he said.
With 230-pound Reggie White of Oklahoma State averaging 5.4 yards per carry
and 127.3 yards per game (No. 2 in the Big 12, No. 11 in the nation),
primarily running between the tackles, Brown said the list of limping
tackles
is a major concern.
He said when Rogers teams with All-American Casey Hampton at the tackles,
the
Longhorns are very hard to run against. "They are the best, as a pair, that
I've been around," he said. "They are the best we've coached or played
against."
Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs played well in Rogers' place, Brown said,
"but
we need to get Shawn back." He also said Rogers is good enough that he
could
miss most of the practices this week and still be able to play at a high
level if his ankle permits it.
Brown said Hampton and Tubbs are the starters, with little used substitute
Miguel McKay the only healthy DT in reserve. He said he is hoping Lee's
foot
improves enough to allow him to play, but said the coaches are "going to
talk
to some of the kids" to see who might want to help out at tackle. He said
sophomore Cole Pittman, a former DT, and true freshman Kalen Thornton are
both 270-pound DEs who could pinch hit at tackle.
"Reggie White will be a big test for us, especially if Shawn can't play,"
he
said.

RECRUITING NOTES: Two national blue-chippers took their official visits to
Texas last weekend. FB James Buchanan of Sarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney,
got
home late Sunday night and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia,
Cal.,
got home Monday morning. Buchanan said he met with coach Brown for about an
hour and he said Brown told him he needs to know as soon as possible what
his
plans are "so I could let them know if they needed to look somewhere else
for
a fullback." He said he really enjoyed his visit, and said he was
pleasantly
surprised to find that the UT business school is ranked No. 5 in the
country.
"I had a really good time," he said. "The players and coaches were really
down to earth, but I want to visit Florida (on Oct. 6) and I want to get
back
to Florida State again before I decide anything." He said Texas "is right
up
there. I really like the Longhorns." Jakes, who lived in Plano when he was
in
junior high, said he had "forgotten how friendly people are in Texas and
how
much they like their football." He said he had a great time, but also wants
to take another visit or two before deciding anything. The Longhorns have
16
commitments and probably will sign 22 to 25 players.

BASEBALL RECRUITING: The Longhorn baseball team  got a commitment Monday
from
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, a hard-throwing righthanded pitcher from Class
2A
state champ Weimar. He was 14-1 last season and averaged almost two
strikeouts per inning. He has good control and walked only 25 batters in 95
innings. He has been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour. He had an 0.70
ERA. He visited Texas last weekend.
