Applewhite Still Doubtful; Simms Looks Like Sure Starter

Coach Mack Brown said Monday QB Major Applewhite's knee sprain is still
being
evaluated and he said Chris Simms would be the starting QB if the Horns had
a
game right now.
Texas doesn't have a game right now, but look for Simms to start Friday
afternoon against Texas A&M and look for him to get all the action unless
he
falters. If he falters, the coaches might try Applewhite, but he has never
been very mobile and he is even less mobile now.
If Applewhite is pressed into action, he probably will work almost
exclusively out of the shotgun because he can't backpedal very well.
Brown said he will have a better idea Tuesday about Applewhite's chances of

playing. He said the doctors were putting Applewhite through a lot of tests

Monday and he said he would have the results Tuesday.
Brown said he thinks Simms, who has had four passes picked off and returned

for touchdowns, has a better understanding of the UT offense now.
"I think he understands now hard hard it is to play quarterback at this
level," Brown said. "After the Kansas game, he said he knew he couldn't
complete every pass and he knew now you have to throw some balls away."
He said that is the key to playing quarterback.
Safety Lee Jackson and TE Brock Edwards, both battling leg injuries, remain

questionable for the Texas A&M game. I goofed in my fax last week when I
said
Greg Brown was hurt. I got my safeties mixed up.

Offensive coordinator  Greg Davis  said the Longhorns need to be have a
balanced offense Friday. He said a good running game makes it harder for a
defense to handle a passing attack, and he said a good passing attack opens

up more running opportunities.
He said the Longhorns have won every game in which they have rushed for 200

or more yards at Texas.
* * * *
ODDS AND WEATHER: The Longhorns are 5 1/2-point favorites and the weather
Friday afternoon is expected to be nice, with highs near 65. There is a
possibility for thundershowers.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: An interesting game note is that three Longhorns

committed to Texas A&M before switching to Texas. They are QB Major
Applewhite, OT Leonard Davis and backup TB Victor Ike. . . TE Marquise Hill

of New Orleans De La Salle told me tonight (Monday) that he still hopes to
take his official visit this weekend, but he said "family problems" might
force him to reschedule. He has already visited LSU and he also plans to
visit Michigan, Georgia and Georgia Tech. . . I went to San Marcos Friday
to
see San Marcos junior DT Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.9, and he is a very
good
player. He will be one of the top DTs in the state next year. He is very
quick, very physical and his motor runs all the time. This year was a
skimpy
year for DTs, but next year should be a good one, with Marco Martin, 6-4,
290, 4.7,  of Mesquite, Rodrique Wright , 6-5, 310, 5.0, of Alief Hastings
and  Anderson. All three of them would be more highly recruited than any DT

in the state except Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison if they were seniors
this year.  The offensive line was the deepest group of top recruits this
year, and there is a good chance the deepest group next year will be the
defensive line. Other top junior defensive linemen include DEs Travis
Leitko,
6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles, 6-3, 245, 4.7, of Lancaster

and Hosea Atkinson, 6-4, 230, 4.65, of Houston Washington, and DTs Patrick
Lee, 6-4, 275, 4.9 of Dallas Carter and Joseph Edwards, 6-3, 260, 4.9, of
Dayton. The Longhorns cleaned up on OLs this year and maybe they can do the

same thing on DLs next year. They will have very good shots at Leitko, who
had already been to a Texas summer camp; Wright, who says his top two teams

are Texas and A&M; and Lee and Edwards, who both have former teammates at
Texas.
* * * *
BASKETBALL NOTES: The Longhorn women defeated No. 15 Virginia, 56-55,
tonight
in the third place game in the Women's preseason NIT. They are 3-1 this
year,
losing only to No. 2 Purdue.
