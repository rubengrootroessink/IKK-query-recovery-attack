> "They gave me his number and I'm going to call him right now," Robison

> He said he met Brown and several other UT coaches and players after
> competing
> in the State Track Meet in May.
> Asked what caused him to pick Texas, he said, "Coach Brown was just

> players
> at Texas all told me he's a straight shooter."
> Robison, who plays middle linebacker at Splendora, said the Texas coaches

> recruited him as a middle backer. He also had offers from LSU and
Houston,
>
> and said coaches from Arkansas, Penn State, Oklahoma and Texas A&M had
> told
> him they would offer if he would visit their schools.
> He had 116 tackles, 6 sacks, 6 passes broken up, 2 fumble recoveries and
a
>

> 25
> "difference makers."
> He is one of the nation's top prep track stars, with a  200-04 3/4 discus

> throw Friday at an AAU track meet in San Antonio that broke the AAU age

> national record, a 62-7 shot put and a 172-10  javelin throw. He has
> qualified for the national AAU Junior Olympic finals in Virginia in late
> July
> in all three events.
> "I knew I wanted to come to Texas," he said, "and I wanted to get it done
> now
> so I could concentrate on doing well in the Junior Olympics.
