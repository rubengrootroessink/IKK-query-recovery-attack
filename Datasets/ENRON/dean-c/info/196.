Lee Jackson Out Indefinitely; OSU Game Set for ABC-TV at 11 a.m.

Longhorn strong safety Lee Jackson has a pulled hamstring and will miss
Saturday's 6 p.m. game with Houston, coach Mack Brown said Monday. He said
Jackson is out indefinitely.
Brown said Jackson was the Longhorns best blitzer from the secondary. He
said
redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson or senior Joe Walker will take his place.
He also said free safety Greg Brown could play strong safety and he could
move Pearson or Walker to strong safety.
"Our safeties are pretty interchangeable," he said.
Brown also defended the Longhorn offensive line, saying it was responsible
for only one of the five sacks Stanford rang up. He said one was caused by
a
running back failing to pick up the blitz and the other three were due to
some missed communications between QB Major Applewhite and his receivers.
"Believe it or not, the protection has been much better with the offensive
line," he said.
He said WR Montrell Flowers was chosen as the best offensive player against
Stanford, while DT Casey Hampton took defensive honors and punt returner
Hodges Mitchell was the top special teams performe.
Brown said Houston will be much like Stanford when it comes to throwing
long
pass after long pass.
He also said the team will practice Tuesday night to give the players as
much
rest as possible after the hard road trip to California. He said night
games
that far away are really tiring because of the long flight home immediately
after the game.
He also said that was the primary reason he wanted the Hawaii game to be
cancelled. "You need to have an open date after a game that far away," he
said.

ABC-TV has picked the Texas-Oklahoma State game Sept. 30 in Austin for a
regional telecast. The time has been set for 11 a.m.

FOOTBALL NOTES: Texas leads the Big 12 in passing offense with 366.5 yards
per game, but the Longhorns are dead last in rushing yardage at 50 yards
per
game. Even lowly Baylor, 11th in the league, is averaging 81.5 yards per
game
rushing. . . Texas leads its series with Houston, 13-7-2, and has won the
last four matches between the two teams. . . The Longhorns are 11-2 at home
since Mack Brown became the head coach. . . Brown hasn't named a starting
QB
for the Houston game, but it probably will be Major Applewhite. He started
the Stanford game and guided the team on 14 of its 18 possessions.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Texas now has 15 commitments, after picking up pledges
from
LB Lance McFarland and RB Anthony Johnson, both of Jefferson, last week.
Johnson ran for more than 200 yards in a losing effort against defending
Class 3A champ Texarkana Liberty-Eylau, and he is one of the top backs I
have
seen on tape this year. McFarland is a hard-nosed tackler with good speed
who
could play inside or outside linebacker . . . LB Derrick Johnson of Waco is
about as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently. He is 6-3 or
6-4
and weighs around 210 and he can really run. He has the frame to carry 230
pounds without losing any speed. He says Texas is still his No. 1 choice,
but
he also says he probably will take all five official visits before making a
decision. Other schools in contention are A&M, FSU, Oklahoma and UCLA, but
he
says, "I'd like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could
see me play." That bodes well for Texas and Texas A&M. . . FB James
Buchanon
of Sarasota, Fla., says he is coming to the Texas-Houston game and will
take
his official visit to Texas this weekend. DE Eric Hall of Clarksville,
Tenn.,
is the only other recruit who has taken an official visit to Texas so far
this year.
