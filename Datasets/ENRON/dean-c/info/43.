and

the

> A big key will be to hang tough early. When the Longhorns won in 1999,
> they
> had to overcome an early 17-0 Oklahoma lead. In last year's blowout, the
> Sooners also jumped out to a big early lead and they kept on pouring it

> Texas has a big offensive line and a big running back and the Longhorns
> might
> be able to wear Oklahoma's defense  down if the Horns can be physical for

> four quarters. That's what Kansas State did last week and the Wildcats
> came
> back from a 35-14 deficit and almost pulled it out.
> Texas needs to avoid falling behind and then try to pull away in the late

> stages because Oklahoma is pretty thin in the defensive line. The
starters

> When he came to Texas as the head coach, he said he asked some of the top
