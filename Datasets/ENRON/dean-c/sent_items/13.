Cara,

Alicia @ Dynegy ultimately decided to cut this schedule as per my call with her at 16:54 PPT
I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55
and Steve @PPM @ 17:21, (because he called me)

Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point.
I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)


I had a long conversation w/
Matt (Pacificorp)
Steve (PPM)
and Karen (Chelan)
-We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.

Note:
Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)

Call me with any question,
Craig
