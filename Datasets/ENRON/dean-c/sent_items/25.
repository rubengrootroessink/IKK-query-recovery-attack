Amy, 
Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.

Clint
