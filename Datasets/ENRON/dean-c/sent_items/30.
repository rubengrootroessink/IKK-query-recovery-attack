As of October 1 we need to be especially careful in using non-firm transmission right only.  Make sure to repeat transmission requests with the BPA as "non-firm on Enron all the way".  Mistakes may cost as much as  $1200/mw if you agree to use Enron's firm rights.  

Also note that some of BPA's network transmission fees have increased by $2.
