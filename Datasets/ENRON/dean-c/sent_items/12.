Hey Carl,

I hope you got my info out to Oliver.  I'd like to hear from him.  I'm still "working" for Enron.  Actually we are just sitting around according to our shift schedule and answering any calls that might come in cuz' there ain't no more tradin' goin' on...

I got an offer to play baseball in Germany this spring/summer.  I think I'm going to do it.  Ich spreche wenig Deutsch, aber mehr Ubungen huete.  (I speak little German, but I practice today)

I plan on sticking around here until 1) they no longer pay me 2) they ask me to leave or 3) all of the above

Hope all is well, 
Deano

Why aren't you staying at your parent's house?  I got a e-card from Toby - thought that was pretty cool...

Check this one out  - I caught and released this nice Chinook hen on the Eel River in Southern Humbolt County last Sunday.
Call me anytime.
Carl
