CRAIG!
What the hell have you been up to?  I just got your email address from Carl. 
  I havent talked to him in about 2 years either.  Last year I tried 
everything to get your address so you could come to my wedding.  I got 
married last July.  My wife, Jennifer, is just finishing up at the U, so she 
is a little younger than us, but she's really cute, intelligent, blah, 
blah....  Anyway, are you still in Portland?  I heard you were working at 
Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing 
anymore, so either give me a call, or I can give you a call if you send your 
number.  I'd love to catch up.  My cell:  206-293-1459.  Call after 2:30 
(yes, that is the end of my work day)  Hope to hear from you soon.

Ollie
