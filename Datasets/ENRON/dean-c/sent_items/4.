Julie,

As I am getting off night shift today, I will be unable to attend the HR presentation.  I believe I filled out all of the necessary paperwork (W-4, direct deposit, and employment application) to get started and I dropped the beneficiary and benefits paperwork on your desk this morning.  Please write me if there is anything else that you need from me.

Craig Dean

Please plan to attend the local UBS HR Presentation given by Gabrielle Hagele and Chris Lue tomorrow, Thursday, 1/24/02 at 9:00 AM in the Mt. Hood Conference Room.  The presentation will detail UBS Benefits and UBS HR Policies.  Time is also set aside for Question and Answers.  

Several UBS HR required forms will be distributed during this meeting.  These forms are required to process payroll and enroll in the benefit plans.  If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me or one of the UBS HR personnel.   See you then!
