I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there, but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from Austin.  You need to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a Halloween party this weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you planning any more trips back to Houston?

Clint

Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the second night,
but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a lot of people
had early flights out the next morning.

This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!  Or at least
some sleep.

What was the name of that band you were playing in your car?  I doubt I
can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

Have a great weekend!
Jen

	Jennifer,
	I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet
up the
	second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out
again on
	Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I
missed you.
	Talk to you soon.

	Clint
