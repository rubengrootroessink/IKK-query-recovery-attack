Subject: RE: This weekend


Guys, unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to bow out of our camping
trip this weekend. I have been rather ill over the last week and a half, and
I'm not sure that I'm up for the elements and all of the alcohol that are
involved in this weekend's festivities. I have been hoping to get better,
but between work and my cold, I don't think I'm up for it. Have fun and
please try not to make too much fun of the "silent one" while you are in a
wood kicking frenzy.

I also have a small tent that can be borrowed if "the silent one" emerges
from the depths of the legal system to join us on our quest for physical
pain, inebriation, and large, uncontrollable fires.
