Amy,
 
Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke 
with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting 
together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at 
Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three 
years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 
and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in 
hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good 
friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you 
think, and we can go from there.

Clint
