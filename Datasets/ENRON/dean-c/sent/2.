Danny and I are in for two a piece and Scott wants one.  Do either of you
want in on the steaks?  If so, let me know how many (they're 8-10 ounces
pre-cooked).

Do you guys want to go in on some New York Strip steaks?  I can pick up some
in bulk at Sam's and marinade them over night.  There are usually 4 eight to
ten ounce steaks per package for around $20.  They are pretty good quality.

If we do it, should I get one or two packages?  I'm thinking two (unless
Scott is bringing Hunter, who we can BBQ instead).

Sounds good to me.  5 o'clock.   Just kidding.
