Growing Legal Problems for Energy Rationing Program
The legal battle provoked by the government =01,s energy rationing program
intensified Thursday with a S?o Paulo judge throwing out the program =01,s
penalties.
Thursday night,a judge in the city of Mar?lia,S?o Paulo issued an injunctio=

suspending all of the penalties contained in the program for households or=
=20
firms
that exceed quota levels for electricity consumption.The injunction was in
response to a challenge of the penalties filed by a federal prosecutor and =
is
applicable to the entire country.
The judge ruled that higher energy charges and the threat of a=20
momentarycutoff of electricity for persons or companies that exceed their=
=20
quotas were
unconstitutional.
Also on Thursday several Supreme Court justices stated that they have no
doubts that a controversial decree issued by the government Wednesday is
unconstitutional.The decree states that measures taken to combat the energy
crisis do not have to respect Brazil =01,s consumer protection code.Accordi=

the
justices,who declined to be identified,the decree violates three articles o=
f=20
the
constitution.
In S?o Paulo,the number of suits challenging the government program
reached seven in the federal district court while in Rio a total of four=20
suits had
been filed by the end of Thursday.
Thus far the government =01,s only response to the program =01,s legal prob=

In related developments Thursday:
=01=07the head of the energy crisis management team Pedro Parente said that=

government would consider a proposal defended by some electricity utilities=
 to
declare every Monday a holiday.Parente said his team would analyze the
economic impact of such a measure which would be only be adopted if the=20

=01=07 the government created a special group of energy experts to prepare =

northeast,the average level fell from 32.6%to 28.5%over this same period,a
reduction of 12.6%.Thus far the decline in consumption is not keeping pace=
