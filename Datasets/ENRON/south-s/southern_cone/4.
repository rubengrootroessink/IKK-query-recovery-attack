Luiz. After consideration of currents events we believe this in an opportune 
moment for you to resign as President of Abraceel and turn over the reigns to 
your successor.  

Two reasons.  First,  the President's position in Abraceel is one that you 
could not fill from Houston and given your imminent departure you need time 
to advise your Board and plan for an orderly transition; secondly, as 
President of Abraceel, you are called by the press to make public statements 
to defend the position of power marketers in general. This is why we wanted 
you in that role in the first place, but due to the current circumstances 
that has become a temporary liability.

When you speak to the Press, you are mostly identified by the informed sector 
leaders as Enron, no matter how thoroughly you try to clarify that  you are 
speaking as President of Abraceel. In the meantime,  Orlando is in the middle 
of intensive negotiations with the government members and some of your recent 
comments have been untimely, in that it makes it appear, in public, that the 
Crisis Management Group issue leader, in insensitive to the power marketers 
(read Enron) position, thus undercutting his leverage. That also puts you in 
an awkward position, because as President of the organization you are not 
serving the membership by not engaging in the public debate.

But this does not mean that you are not still fully engaged in the battle!. 
Your prediction that the "policy makers" are taking decisions that will hurt 
the market may come true, and if so, we Enron, will come out fighting.  

In the mean time,  we will be needing your background and knowledge to move 
our viewpoints through the open doors that have been presented to us in the 
negotiations. 

Rick Shapiro has committed your assistance to the region as long as it is 
needed. Joe and Orlando would have wished that the clock could be stopped and 
you physical departure be postponed. But they are well aware that it is not 
fair to you and your family to postpone the move. We will work something out 
so that you can provide assistance from the USA.

Thank you for your perseverance on this long fight.

Jose
