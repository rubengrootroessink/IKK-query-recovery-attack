 Dear Pool Board: ?Here's a sample of the tickets. ?Sorry if you get a sore  
neck from reading them. ??Haven't made any copies yet so can still make  
changes. ?Any suggestions? ?I want to hand them out at swim team meeting on  
23rd and practices. ?Let me know what you think. ?I went off last years  
hours. I checked with Michelle and $5 sounded like a good price. ?Last year  
it was $4 but you had to buy a drink separate (which everyone did anyways)  
and this year the canned drink will be included. ?Appreciate any input so 
can  
get these done! ??Thanks, Ann
