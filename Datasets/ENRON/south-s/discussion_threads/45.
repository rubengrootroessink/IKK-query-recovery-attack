FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:   Monday, April 23, 2001

     HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), an S&P 500 Index company, today
reported record first quarter net income available to common of $212.5
million, or $1.79 per share compared to net income available to common of
$38.8 million, or $.33 per share in the first quarter a year ago.

     "At a time when the industry as a whole is struggling to maintain flat
gas production, EOG increased U.S. natural gas production by over seven
percent.  This demonstrates our ability to continue to grow our production
organically," said Mark G. Papa, chairman and chief executive officer.
"Our operations and drilling inventory are in the best shape ever; we are
off to a great start in 2001."

     Versus the same quarter a year ago, EOG's North American daily natural
gas production increased 4.2 percent, crude and condensate production
increased 7.4 percent and natural gas liquids production decreased 31.4
percent.  This resulted in overall EOG North American production growth of
approximately four percent, consistent with the 2001 full year target.
Based on shares outstanding, production per share increased approximately
five percent in North America.

     "EOG has significantly ramped up its North American activity," Papa
noted.  "Over the last year, our acreage position (including trades) has
increased over 50 percent, our geological and geophysical headcount has
grown by over 20 percent and EOG currently has 50 percent more rigs
drilling than this time last year.  To position EOG for the future, North
American capital expenditures increased during the first quarter to $185.0
million, compared to $85.3 million in the first quarter 2000."

     Results from the quarter further solidify EOG's focus on organic
growth and its long-term financial strategy.  EOG continued to strengthen
its financial structure with the following:

        Reduced the number of common shares outstanding by approximately
        700,000 to 116.2 million,

        Paid down $214.1 million of debt, reducing the debt to total
        capitalization ratio from 38.3 percent at year end 2000 to 29.6
        percent at the end of the first quarter 2001 and

        Increased the annual common dividend by 14 percent from $.14 to
        $.16 per share.

     EOG's first quarter conference call will be available via live audio
webcast at 9:30 a.m. Central Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time) on Monday,
April 23, 2001.  To listen to this webcast, log on to www.eogresources.com.
The webcast will be archived on EOG's website for 14 days.
