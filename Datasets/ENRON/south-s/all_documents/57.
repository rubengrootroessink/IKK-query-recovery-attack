I had not received an invoice from this producer for this deal, so I called 
them. They told me that this deal was not under Mirant Canada, and should 
have possibly been under Mirant Americas Energy Mktg. LP instead. Could you 
please check and see if we have this deal under the wrong counterparty name? 
Thank you.
