Please respond via e-mail if there are any scheduling conflicts or questions.

We have identified the pilot for West Gas Trading to be,  Steve South/ssouth 
and Susan Scott/sscott3.  Below is the path to the MAR for this Business 
Unit.  I have also included a list of users for quick reference.  If the

immediately if this date changes.

Please respond via e-mail with the earliest possible date for rolling pilot 
user Steve South/ssouth and Susan Scott/sscott3 to Outlook, so we can be 
available to assist this user with the transition that morning.
