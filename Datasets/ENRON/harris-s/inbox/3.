FYI

I received a voice mail from Jack Foley at PG &E wanting to breakup the prepayment ($ 1,700,000 ) due December 26 into four weekly installments. My response is to reject that request and walk him through TW with the most current information. This would be similar to what Kevin did with two vendors this morning, Nuovo Pignone and LaBarge Steel.

Regards.
