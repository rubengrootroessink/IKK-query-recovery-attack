Hey Steve - I just wanted to touch base with you prior to the new year.  I have accepted a position for the next year in Lake Jackson beginning on January 2nd.  Hopefully a year is all it will take to get a teaching certificate.  I look forward to seeing how the energy job market looks after this time.  At least with this position I have a good couple of months off during the summer.  Any way, I hope you had a nice Christmas and have a safe new year as well.  I'll talk with you later.
 
Christine
