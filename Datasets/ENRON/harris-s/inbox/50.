Steve -

 I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If your
team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
start discussing  with them.

On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80 hours *
rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate to
put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by you
before Friday.

Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the other
officers.


Dave

   Hello Steve -

   Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I
   moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and
   have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
   Optimization
   projects.

   I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has
   a
   strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered
   Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for
   making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
   companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
   This
   is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


   1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
   2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
   3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
   RCM
   (say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
   4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
   the
   next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

   I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around
   the
   Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
   discuss
   further.

   Hope all is well.
