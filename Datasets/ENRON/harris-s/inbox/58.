Hi Steve, yes I still have the bike for sale, I just decided to sell it last friday (11/23).  I hate to part with it, but I'm trying to raise capital to fund a business venture.  I don't have any pictures of it, but I can borrow my girlfriends digital camera and get you some; however, I won't see her until this friday (11/30), and we are heading out of town until 12/4.  I'll try to see if I can do anything before then, but I can't say for sure, as I don't own a computer or any computer equipment.  I only have computer access at my job.  In reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company's usually charge by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn't weigh that much, but you'd probably have to check with a truck line to verify a freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but
it's still in the person's name that I purchased the bike from.  He had it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more info.

Thx.

Greg Rowe
