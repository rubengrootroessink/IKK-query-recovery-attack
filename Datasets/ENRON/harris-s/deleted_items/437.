Rod: 

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to 
have follows: 

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years 
2.  Revenue breakdown: 
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period 
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs 
   for each type of transportation contract 
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal 
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the 
projected years 
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world 
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward 
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates, 
future liabilities 

Thanks Rod. 

When you have a time in mind for a call to discuss the above list please 
contact:
