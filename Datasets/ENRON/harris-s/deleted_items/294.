Just a quick not, keep December 4th available to meet with FERC and SoCalGas in Chicago.  We will begin at 9:00 a.m..   I will ask for Ann to get a meeting room at one of the hotels close to the airport.  At a minimum (I'm sure there will be others), Georgetta Baker and J.P. Harrigan will be representing SoCalGas at the meeting.  I will let you know more information when its available.  Greg
