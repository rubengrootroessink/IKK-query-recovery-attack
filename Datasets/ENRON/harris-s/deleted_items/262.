Julie, I know that Steve will probably not need your assistance, but (smile) if he does, please try to help.  I will be out just this one day.

Thanks a million,

Please be informed, I will be out on vacation this Monday,  October 29.   I will be available for you, however, just call me on my cell phone (713) 822-7040 or leave me a voice mail.  I will log in from home and try to work from home as much as possible.

Thanks and have a great weekend.
