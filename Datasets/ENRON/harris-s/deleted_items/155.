I'm sorry you won't be able to make it to the meeting on the 9th, however I wanted to pass on the attached invitation in the event that your travel plans do change.

In conjunction with the PNW Gas Electric Integration Group meeting on November 9, Calpine would like to invite each of you to the open house of their new Portland office in the Fox Tower.  The open house will be held on November 8 from 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. (see attached invitation for details).  If you have any questions please call Jodi Lietz at 503-552-3785.   RSVP's should also be made to Jodi.

Take care and I hope to see you at the next meeting in early 2002.  Pat
