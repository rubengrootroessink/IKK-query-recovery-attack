I finally felt it.
I was always wondering what they were all talking about until, This morning...
I did my weekly weigh-in and when I saw that smaller number swing around that scale,
I didn?FFFF92t know whether to faint, scream, or cry.
So I danced.
Just imagine, a large woman with crazy hair, laughing and dancing naked in her living room with her scale.
I gave that scale a big sloppy-wet kiss!!...
I lost 8 pounds in one week!
I have lost a total of 53 pounds in exactly 3 months.
I KNOW what made the difference this last 3 months?FFFF85
My hubby and I bought a product that was recommended by an affiliate.
Not just any ole product, A MIRACLE, Called BerryTrim Plus!
I use it 2 times a day and it lit a fire under my Wimpy old metabolism.
I have tried and failed with over 80 different diet programs. I swore, that I would never try another diet product again.
So many times I thought I was going to give up, and give in to the fact that I?FFFF92ll never be thin and attractive.
I am SOOOOOOO glad I didn't. WOE, this really works and its sooo Damn easy.
