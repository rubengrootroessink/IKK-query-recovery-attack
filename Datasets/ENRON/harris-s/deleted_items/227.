I've made reservations at the LaGrillia again.  Because I didn't know how long your meeting with Calpine would take, I made the reservations for 12:30 today.

Thank you very much for the nice card and plant. You make working here much easier and I feel like we have a great team. I really could not ask for more than what you do now. Thanks again.
