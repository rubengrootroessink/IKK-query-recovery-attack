Dear Steve

We need your feedback to better define leadership development for WEI.

As you may be aware the WEI Board has approved recommendations on how WEI
should evaluate our activities and then recognize the many people who
contribute to their design, development and delivery.  We will clearly
standardize how we evaluate "what" WEI does.  However, due to the very
different approaches used in the past to develop programs and people, the
Committee sees a strong to need clarify what members desire when it comes to
industry specific leadership development.

Following are a list of possible components of a WEI Industry Specific
Leadership Development program.  Will you please take a few minutes to rate
these components based on the value to you and to your organization?

To participate in the survey, simply reply to this email and hit send upon
completion.  And feel free to offer comments where appropriate.  Thank you
in advance for helping us by sharing your experiences and opinions.

Please rate the following components.
