Good morning sweatheart. Its really hard for me to be away from you.  I think about you all the time.  I love to sleep next to you and wake up with you in the morning.  I really wanted to stay with you Saturday night.  Maybe I can work something out for this weekend.  Love you.

Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you.

Stan's staff meeting was cancelled so I am just trying to catch up on things this morning.

Love you sweetie.
