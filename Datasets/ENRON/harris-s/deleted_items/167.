Steve:  I know you got involved with the group as a speaker so let me know if you want to continue getting the meeting notices.  Since Enron is a member, you and anyone else in your group is always welcome to attend.  I'll be sure to pass on any good info I pick up as I still have some options that are now seriously out of the money.  Take care.  Pat
