Hello Steve -

Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I
moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and
have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline Optimization
projects.

I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has a
strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered
Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for
making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.  This
is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from RCM
(say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the
next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around the
Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss
further.

Hope all is well.
