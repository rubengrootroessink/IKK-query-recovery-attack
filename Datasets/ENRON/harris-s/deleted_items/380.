SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for partie=
s to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's =
position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC st=
atement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your=
 thoughts.  SoCalGas has asked for a response by Tuesday noon.  Thanks.    =

Subject: A.01-09-024 PHC Statement draft
To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) M=
eet and Confer:=20
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruli=
ng of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed with=
in 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of Nov=
ember).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, befor=
e the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus view=
s articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on th=
e description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect t=
his case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I =
ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you wan=
t to "sign on."  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.=
  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my b=
est to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-=
positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements wil=
l be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on be=
half of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive c=
hanges are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for yo=
ur cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your indi=
vidual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's n=
ame off this one.=20
Thanks again.=20
