You are right, I am always glad when I listen to you. You are just so wonderful. That is why I would do anything for you because I love you so much. Can't wait to see you.

Love,
	Steve

I really love you.  I can't wait to be with you this weekend.  I bet you are glad you listened to me and did not buy any Enron stock at $21, considering it is at $18 today!!!

Love you,

Tracy
