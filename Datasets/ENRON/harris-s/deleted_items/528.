hey steve, 
i guess the good news is that you still have an enron e-mail adress. i hope all goes OK for you. ive been trying to follow things in the paper and mom sends me some stuff. im really sorry youre caught in the middle. maybe there will be a bright spot in all this. i have no idea what it would be, but i hope its there. 
yes i still have it. i wouldnt mind selling it. i just dont have the time right now. if you were interested in doing something, i have about 1300 into it. if we could get 2500 for it,i would split the profits with you. what do you think. i havent stared it for about a year though.  
yeah, i heard abut jeanie. not very reliable, although i did lend her about 400 bucks a few weeks ago and she senrt me a check about a week later. that was a first. did you see tracy during thanksgiving?  are you still going out with her?? monique and i had a great time. we didnt do squat...it was perfect. 
let me know ho wthe enron stuff goes. you must be busy as hell taking care of shit that comes up from this whole mess. i remember when hart was going through this, they had me doing all kinds of financial reports, this way and that for the courts, the buyers, etc. good luck. 
well, i need to run. keep in touch. oh yeah, i dont see any trips in the near future, but ill let you know.  
see ya, jim
