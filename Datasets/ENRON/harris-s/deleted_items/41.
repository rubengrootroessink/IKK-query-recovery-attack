This afternoon (Wednesday 12/19) we delivered all  468 gift bags to Gordon Elementary for their student Holiday Party on  12/20.  With your help, we raised over $2000 that we used to sponsor 33  of those children.  
 
Due to recent company events, the Enron  Kids Committee had a very difficult time getting sponsors for all the kids,  but no one was left out.  We used our remaining charity fund to make sure  EVERY child received their gift.  
 
Though we reduced the sponsor amount by eliminating  the shoes and jacket from the gift bags, we had enough money left over to  purchase gift certificates for shoes for the kids from a national chain  store.  
 
Though a lot of program sponsors we're without jobs  this holiday season, we only had to buy gifts for 23 kids (5% of the total) at  the last minute; this was significantly less than what I had dreaded  it might be.
 
Thank you for all your help and support.  468  Houston children have a better holiday because of you.
 
Best Wishes to You All,
Kevin Hyatt
Co-Chairman
