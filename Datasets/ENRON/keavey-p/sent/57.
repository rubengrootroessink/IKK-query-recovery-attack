The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for 
existing products in the next few weeks. 
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas 
Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some 
work. 
I should have a list of new locations shortly.

Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things 
happen.  

Thanks,

Pete
