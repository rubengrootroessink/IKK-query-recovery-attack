Louise,

Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the 
unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet 
technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have 
gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a 
trader on the system it has been very frustrating.  


Regards, 

Pete Keavey
