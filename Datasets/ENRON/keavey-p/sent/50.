Subject: Focus Group with traders -- EnronOnline Commercial

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in 
creating an effective ad.
