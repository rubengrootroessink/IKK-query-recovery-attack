Hey there -  
So, are we all ready for Halloween?  Mikey and Marissa can't wait!   We've had some practice already with the town parade and a few parties.   I thought they would sleep in the darn costumes!  Mikey is Batman and  Marissa is Pooh Bear.  How are the girls?  Is Pete watching the ball  games?  Mike can't stand it!  He's driving me crazy with his sour  moods!  Will anyone be visiting you for Thanksgiving?  What are your  plans for Christmas?  I hope we can get together this time around.  I  can't wait to see little Caroline!  Bob Spear just had another girl.   He names her Caroline also.  Well, back to the rugrats!
