1. Main Course: The Hunt for a Truly Grand Turkey

made people anticipate the Thanksgiving bird with pleasure
because of its deep, rich flavor. Also: tips for making the
most of your bird.

be juicy, spicy red wines and great values to boot.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Tomorrow is turkey day. If you haven't been to the store
yet, here are some wine ideas to speed up your Thanksgiving
Day shopping.

2000 Geyser Peak Winery, California, Gewurztraminer
$10 - A real crowd-pleaser. With its floral, juicy
character, this slightly sweet white captures the essence of
California gewurztraminer.

2000 Villa Mt. Eden, Coastal, Pinot Noir
$10 - A silky, strawberry-scented wine. Herbal notes add
interest while soft tannins and barely noticeable oak make
it terrific with turkey.

2000 Clos du Bois, Sonoma, Pinot Noir
$16 - Just plain pretty, this versatile pinot sports a touch
of toastiness, delicate earthy aromas and sweet cherry
flavors.

1998 Edmeades, Mendocino, Zinfandel
$ 16 - Zin can be a huge wine that overpowers food, but not
this one. It's a cool-climate red with zesty acidity, lots
of berry fruit and light tannins.


4. NYC Restaurants: Vietnamese Cuisine That Plays Long Shots
=================================================

Vietnamese may or may not have a word for chutzpah, says
William Grimes, but TanDa has plenty of it, regardless.

$25 and Under: At a No-Frills Pizza Spot, a Perfectionist's
Pie

Finding good pizza is easier than it used to be, though not
if you want just a slice. Luckily, one holdout in Midwood,
Brooklyn stands solidly against the tide.
