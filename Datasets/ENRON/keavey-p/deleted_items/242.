America, you're only one click away from the lowest airfares on the planet. 
Quickfare Finder, combining 20 years of expertise and designed for consumers--not airlines--is here! We invite you to be among the first to check it out. If you want to find the lowest possible fare between two cities, spend some time Beta testing Quickfare Finder and let us know what you think. 
For the next few days, we're inviting a very select number of travelers to "kick the tires" on this new and exciting system. Your e-mail address was chosen at random from out Hot Deals by E-Mail list. We hope you take the time to experience this new way to find the lowest possible airfares. No other site on the Web offers you more options to save travel dollars. 
Please note that we have a large team of programmers making cosmetic, and other necessary changes, throughout the weekend. We ask your patience and understanding as we tweak the system. 
To access Quickfare Finder, please click here  http://www.bestfares.com  and choose your destination. Choose Quickfare Finder and enter your city pair at the prompts provided at the upper left of the screen. We welcome your comments by e-mail sent to quickfares@bestfares.com
