Dear Customer:

Here is your RateWatch subscription from iOwn.com.

Still using that credit card with the sky high interest
rate? It's time to transfer your balance to a card that
makes sense. The Capital One Platinum card gives you 0%
interest on new purchases until March 2001 and 9.9% on all
transferred balances.
