WHAT WE'RE READING 
[IMAGE]"Big Chief Elizabeth" 
by Giles Milton
The follow-up to his best-selling "Nathaniel's Nutmeg," Giles Milton's "Big 
Chief Elizabeth" is a sprawling, ambitious tale of how the aristocrats and 
privateers of Elizabethan England reached and colonized the "wild and 
barbarous shores" of the New World. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]"The Dark Valley" 
by Piers Brendon
The 1930s were a time of worldwide economic crisis and political 
instability--and the gestation period of World War II. Piers Brendon examines 
each of the major powers of the conflict in turn as they move from breadlines 
to battlefields in "The Dark Valley," an elegantly written study of those 
difficult days. [IMAGE]Read more

Twenty-five people set sail aboard the Karluk in search of an arctic

Jennifer Niven tells their "Endurance"-esque tale of survival in "The Ice 
Master." [IMAGE]Read more

NEW IN PAPERBACK: AMERICAN HISTORIES  
Three distinctly different approaches to American history. 

[IMAGE]"The American Century" 
by Harold Evans
Harold Evans's tight, journalistic prose marks the significant events and 
personages in America's rise to superpower status in this sprawling yet 
eminently readable history of the 20th century. Filled with photographs and 
contemporary editorial cartoons, "The American Century" is an excellent 
one-volume chronicle of a momentous 100 years. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]"The Great Republic: A History of America" 
by Sir Winston Churchill and Winston S. Churchill
Everyone knows Winston Churchill as the great statesman who helped sail 
Britain's ship of state through World War II. Less noticeable have been 
Churchill's contributions as a historian and author. Many of his numerous 
histories contain information on the United States--from America's discovery 
to the nation's founding and up to the mid-20th century. Grandson Winston S. 
Churchill has edited this work into one volume, titled "The Great Republic," 
now available in paperback. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]"Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong" 
by James W. Loewen
Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen more than picking apart the 
cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high 
school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to roadside historical markers, 
guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre 
sites. After finishing Loewen's alternately angry and bemused expos,, readers 
will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide 
again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for 
themselves. [IMAGE]Read more

EDITOR'S CHOICE: "FOUNDING BROTHERS" 
[IMAGE]"Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation" 
by Joseph J. Ellis
In retrospect, it seems as if the American Revolution was inevitable. But was 
it? In "Founding Brothers," Joseph J. Ellis reveals that many of those truths 
we hold to be self-evident were actually fiercely contested in the early days 
of the republic. [IMAGE]Read more
