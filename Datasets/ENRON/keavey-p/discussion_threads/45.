Peter,

I work with Jeanie and she filled me in on your good news . . . 
congratulations.  I know that this must be a very exciting time in your 
life.  I am going to forward you a form via interoffice mail that you will 
need to fill out after you legally adopt your new child.  Please forward this 
completed form along with the adoption papers to me at EB3667A, and I will 
turn them in for you.

If you have any additional questions,  please let me know and I will be more 
than happy to assist you.

Thanks, and congratulations again.
Anne Labbe'
