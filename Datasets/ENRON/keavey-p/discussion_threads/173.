***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Vail
Vail has been synonymous with skiing since the 1960s, and is still=20
rated the best ski area in the United States by many polls year after=20
year. With 4,000 acres of skiable (and boardable) terrain, 25 chair=20
lifts, and a wide range of terrain, it's no wonder this huge mountain
remains popular. And unlike some ski areas, the town of Vail is a=20
destination unto itself, with sophisticated shopping, dining, and=20
entertainment options to keep even complete non-skiers happy.=20

Sydney
Want to escape winter for real? Then head down under, where summer is=20

Northern Hemisphere. Sydney's an exciting place to visit any time.=20
And with Olympic tourists long gone, and the weather getting=20
beautiful, now's a great time to discover the opera house,=20
picturesque harbor, world-famous Bondi Beach, and more.=20

Taos
Located in the beautiful Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Taos is=20
different from many ski towns you may have visited. Many have the=20
dining and entertainment options that Taos (population: 5,000) has,=20
but few can boast of having a cultural scene quite like Taos. For=20
over 100 years, the town has attracted a growing number of artists,=20
drawn by the distinctive light, desert beauty, and supportive=20
community. Today, about 15 percent of the town's permanent residents=20
are artists. In addition, the rich cultural traditions of the area's=20
Mexican and Native American populations would make this a fascinating=20
vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of=20
the best in the Rockies.=20

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place=20
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a=20
wide range of resorts--you're never too far from the mountains in=20
tiny Switzerland. Towns such as Zermatt and St. Moritz are where=20
you'll find the classic upscale European ski-resort experience. Not=20
to worry; you'll also find more modest areas sprinkled among the=20
hyper-glamorous ones. The country's famous cuisine, shopping, orderly=20
cities, and picturesque mountain scenery are year-round treats, and=20
enough to keep anyone busy all vacation long.=20
