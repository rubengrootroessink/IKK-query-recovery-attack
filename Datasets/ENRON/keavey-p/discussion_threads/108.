Subject: Columbia Homestead Expansion  

Columbia is taking expressions of interest in a project they are calling the 
Homestead expansion for firm (or possibly off-peak or seasonal firm) 
transportation into Operating Areas 1 and 10.  The open season will end on 
1/19/01.  The project could include Columbia working with another pipeline in 
the region, such as Transco to deliver more volumes using Transco's South 
Virginia lateral or CNG to deliver more volumes on the PL-1 line.  The 
project could include expanding Columbia's own line into Market Areas 33 and 
34 through looping or added compression.  Columbia is also considering 
building a line away from Loudoun, where LNG volumes will be delivered from 
the Cove Point pipeline, to power projects in Loudoun or Fauquier Counties in 
Virginia.  Columbia has also considered an idea in the past to build a line 
from the Cove Point terminal to BG&E through Calvert and Anne Arundel 
Counties.  Columbia indicated that they have talked with Bill Fox of 
VNG/ALG.  Columbia would like to talk with us concerning VNG, Hopewell or any 
other needs that we might have.
