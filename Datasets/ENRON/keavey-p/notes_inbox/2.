HISTORY: BEST OF 2000 

Editor, Sunny Delaney


 [IMAGE]	I admit it--I have an odd range of interests. But my editor's picks 
for 2000 do share a few characteristics. Whether the topic is the Battle of 
Iwo Jima, the American Revolution, early Britain, or a terrible fire, these 
top 10 history books all have strong narratives and compelling 
protagonists--in addition to meticulous research and attention to detail.  
	
	Ten not enough for you, either? Check out my 15 honorable mentions. 

EDITOR'S CHOICE 
[IMAGE]1. "Flags of Our Fathers" 
by James Bradley and Ron Powers
Five days after the landing on Iwo Jima, a platoon of marines and a navy 
corpsman climbed Mount Suribachi to raise the American flag. Joe Rosenthal 
snapped a quick photo--one that became a 20th-century icon. "Flags of Our 
Fathers" describes the Battle of Iwo Jima through the lives of the flag 
raisers--and their families. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]4. "To the Best of My Ability: The American Presidents" 
edited by James M. McPherson and David Rubel 
As we approach the end of this presidential election year, we might do well 
to look back at those who have held the office. In "To the Best of My 
Ability," 32 members of the Society of American Historians write about those 
41 men, Washington to Clinton, and explore the campaigns, elections, 
presidency, and legacy of each. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]5. "In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex" 
by Nathaniel Philbrick
The harrowing account of the whaleship Essex--think "The Endurance" without 
the happy ending--is enough to hold anyone's attention. The crew of the 
Essex, their ship rammed and sunk by a whale, spent weeks at sea in light 
boats with very limited food and water. In the end, the sailors were forced 
to make a terrible choice while drifting "In the Heart of the Sea." [IMAGE]

[IMAGE]6. "The Circus Fire: A True Story" 
by Stewart O'Nan
As some 9,000 people watched the Wallendas begin their high-wire act on July 
6, 1944, a fire started on the sidewall of the bigtop. In minutes, the entire 
tent was engulfed in flames. Stewart O'Nan brings his remarkable storytelling 
ability to the tragedy of "The Circus Fire." [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]7. "Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the 
Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869" 
by Stephen E. Ambrose
Abraham Lincoln was convinced that the United States would flourish only if 
its far-flung regions were linked, replacing sectional loyalties with an 
overarching sense of national destiny. Building a transcontinental railroad, 
therefore, was second only to the abolition of slavery on his presidential 
agenda. Stephen E. Ambrose examines the building of the railroad--and the 
experiences of the everyday "Joes" involved--in "Nothing Like It in the 
World." [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]8. "A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World, 3500 B.C.-1603 
A.D." 
by Simon Schama
Combining the resources of the BBC with Simon Schama's literary panache, "A 
History of Britain" is a beautifully written, handsomely crafted book on the 
sceptered isle. From pre-Roman Britain through the reign of Elizabeth I, 
Schama's lucid prose is embellished with dozens of striking illustrations. An 
excellent general history, and highly recommended. [IMAGE]Read more

When peace finally came in November 1918, four years of fierce fighting and 
unprecedented bloodshed was over. "Victory 1918" tells the story of the Great 
War, its leaders, its terrors, and its blunders--and it makes the worldwide 
relief felt at the end of the war all the more understandable. [IMAGE]Read
