**************************** December 4, 2000  ************************

If your travel plans include coast-to-coast travel between now and March
1, we strongly suggest that you review our $158-238 roundtrip
Coast-to-Coast Super Sale Fares. These fares have just been discounted and
can take you between two groups of cities, each group encompassing a wide
geographic area. The first group includes Los Angeles, San Diego, Ontario,
Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Jose, Sacramento,
Reno, Portland (OR), Seattle, Denver, Colorado Springs and many more. The
second group includes a wide assortment of Midwest and East Coast cities,
including Boston, Hartford, New York City, Washington (DC), Atlanta,
Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Chicago, Houston and Dallas.
If you want to travel between Washington (DC) and San Diego for example,
the lowest published 21-day advance fare is a whopping $742 roundtrip plus
a $40 fuel surcharge, bringing the final cost up to $782. Our lowest
14-day advance purchase fare is $238 with no $40 fuel surcharge added. You
can purchase your ticket and as many as three companion tickets at
super-low fares if you purchase by December 5. In our sample fare
scenario, you can even use alternate airport strategy and depart from
Baltimore instead of Washington, to lower your fare to $158 roundtrip. Our
travel agents stand ready to help you with alternate airport
recommendations. Be sure to note the December 5 deadline for Super Sale
Coast-to-Coast savings. Visit

FINAL 2 DAYS: FLY TO 7 MEXICAN CITIES AND SAVE UP TO 70%
It's chili today in most of the U.S. and hot tamale in Mexico. You can
save up to 70 percent on airfares to several destinations in sun-drenched
Mexico for travel this winter. These sale fares for Christmas and New
Year's have sold out, but there's plenty left for travel between January 8
and March 1. We have great airfares to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Acapulco,
Ixtapa, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and the hottest of the current beach hot
spots--Los Cabos. How about San Diego to Los Cabos for $178 roundtrip
(kids $99) or Boston, New York City, Washington (DC) or Atlanta to Mexico
City for $238 (kids $149)? Fly from Denver, San Francisco, Portland (OR)
or Seattle to Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos for $218 roundtrip (kids $109);
Dallas, Chicago, St. Louis or Kansas City for $258 (kids $129). Treat
yourself to a wonderful beginning to 2001 with cheap Bestfares.com tickets
to Mexico. Getting through the hustle and bustle of the holidays is apt to
be a lot easier if you can look forward to a winter vacation on the beach.
 This deal also requires fast action, with less than 36 hours left to
purchase. Tickets will only be available until 6:00 p.m. (CST) December 5.

discounted by up to 65 percent, an inexpensive getaway is yours for the
booking. Hotel Reservations Network (HRN) has accommodations in Las Vegas

Plaza from only $149.95; the Four Points Sheraton Hotel in Orlando and the
Ramada Plaza in downtown San Francisco from only $99.95. Enjoy New
