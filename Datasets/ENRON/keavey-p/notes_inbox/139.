I could not agree more. If a bunch of old limosuine liberals can't get it
right, tell them to soothe themselves by looking at their bank accounts.

Also, how ironic is it that Ole William Daley, Gore's spokesman, is the son
of the former mayor of Chicago who stole the election for JFK.

oh, and in case i forgot to add, the ballots used in West Palm Beach were
approved by a Democrat!!

if they want to change the ballot and correct the system, i say go for it
and
maybe by 2004 this won't happen again.  but unfortunately people voted
within
the confines of the system and like it or not, that's the way it is.  the
results are the results.  it would be like me saying that on my SAT's i
couldn't
align the dots correctly with my answers and that's why I scored so low.  I
really should have had at least a 1400.

as 'ol john coch said "if the glove don't fit, yous got to acquit" so if
bush is
ahead when all the ballots are all in, then you have to give him the
presidency.

Easy there old bags in Florida.  I can't take this BS.  The votes have been
counted twice and GWB has won both times.  If these left win bags can't vote
correctly they shouldn't vote at all.  I needed to get that off my chest.
