28th for registration and orientation.  Breakfast will be served, t-shirts
distributed, and all Christmas in April*Bronx volunteers will be there so

Bronx Caf?.

completed earlier, and in others, later.
? If you have any special dietary or medical needs, it is your
responsibility to ensure they are met.
? Do not bring any valuables with you.  They will be your responsibility.
? If you bring tools or other supplies with you, they too are your
responsibility.
? The work is very messy and includes painting, please dress accordingly.

Please feel free to bring additional volunteers with you; all are welcome.
If you are interested in attending, please email or call Betsy Boland
