Please respond to Dear RealMoney.com Subscribers,

It's hysterically funny what people are demanding
of my personal account. People want it updated
immediately and they want the ideas ahead of when
I actually buy (I am doing that). In fact I am letting
our readers front-run me on everything! I reveal what
I am about to recommend and I recommend before I buy.

That's the total antidote to the way Wall Street works.
They want to know how much money I am putting into each
stock. Done. They want the dates that I did it. Harder
because I buy in small increments. They want my stop-loss
limits if I could stop-loss out. I can't do that because
of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it
yesterday or at least when I started this game, and the
market was much higher.

Hey, I am listening! Exclusively on RealMoney.com, you
now have access to my own Personal Portfolio, which is
made up of my picks, shares owned, basis, current value
and gains that he buys and sells on a day-to-day basis.

As of Friday, the portfolio market value is $1,247,537
making me a profit of $124,650.03.
