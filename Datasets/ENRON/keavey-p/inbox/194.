Please respond to feedbackDear Peter,
At Travelocity, we love to travel. We enjoy seeing new sights, 
meeting new people, and trying new restaurants. There's just one 
thing we don't like about traveling: the cost (we're guessing you 
know what we're talking about!). But we've come up with something 
that can help. 
The Travelocity Preferred Traveler Program offers a unique package of 
discounts, upgrades, and special perks to help make your travel, 
shopping, and dining experiences less expensive--and more enjoyable. 
And it's available only through Travelocity!
