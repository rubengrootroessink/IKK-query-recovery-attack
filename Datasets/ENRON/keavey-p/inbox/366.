Notice # 01-186
June 1, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain
Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and
COMEX Transactions

DATE:
June 1, 2001
===========================================================

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will
serve as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for
use on a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained
from the Exchange's Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for
Joint Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the
Joint Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing
Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank
subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable
Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank
parent or affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use
of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a "pass-through" basis on
both divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be
able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by
customers. It should be noted that while securities and deliverable
warehouse receipts, as detailed below, may be used by customers for margin
purposes, such assets may not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing
Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some
time on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit
customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with
Clearing Members on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any
one issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their
market value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at
no more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.


AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 4.01 ("CUSTOMER'S MARGINS"), NYMEX RULE 9.05
("MARGINS") AND TO COMEX CLEARING ASSOCIATION RULE 48 ("DEPOSIT OF
SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AS ORIGINAL MARGIN")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 4.01. CUSTOMER'S MARGINS

(A) Initial margin at least equal to the level set for customers shall be
required of all customers. In no case shall a customer's initial margin be
less than a specified amount per contract, or a specified percentage of the
market value at which any commodity is bought or sold, such customer's
margin to be determined and announced by the Board of Directors or its
designee.

 (B) Once the required initial margin has been deposited for each
individual transaction, such trade and such margin shall, for the purposes
of this rule, lose their individual identity and be commingled with all
other trades and margins in the same commodity for the same customer
account.

 (C) When the margin (Net Liquidating Value plus Non-Cash Deposits) in a
customer's account declines below the maintenance margin requirement
applicable to the open positions carried in such account, the Member Firm
carrying said account is required to collect (call) from the customer such
funds, which when deposited, will restore it to the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (D) A Member Firm shall not accept orders for new trades on behalf of an
undermargined customer account other than those which reduce its initial
margin requirement unless such Member Firm has been given assurances by
said customer that funds sufficient to restore the account to its then
prevailing initial margin requirement are forthcoming and will be received
in a reasonable amount of time not to exceed one business day for Floor
Members and three business days for all other customers.

(E)(1) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more
of the following forms as margin to cover open NYMEX Division positions:

 (a) United States Currency; or any currency freely convertible to United
States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value
shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin
obligation.

 (b) securities issued by the Department of the Treasury of the United
States maturing within ten (10) years of the date of the deposit and
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government.
Such securities shall be valued at ninety five percent (95%) of par value.

*(c) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in
the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free
from liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of
the market value thereof;

(d) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.

(e) deliverable warehouse receipts for commodities traded on the Exchange
provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of
the value of the commodity.*

[(c)] *(f)* The net liquidating value in a customer's account over the
initial margin requirements for the positions carried for such account.

(2) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more of
the following forms as margin to cover open COMEX Division positions:

(a) United States currency, checks payable in United States currency, or
currency freely convertible to United States currency; provided that if
foreign currency is deposited, its value shall be calculated so that at the
current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency
satisfies the customer's margin obligations;

(b) the net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial
margin requirements for the positions carried for such account;

(c) securities issued or guaranteed by the United States, provided that
such securities shall be valued at the lower of the par or market value
thereof;

(d) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the
over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free from
liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of the
market value thereof;

(e) *deliverable* warehouse receipts *for commodities traded on the
Exchange provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more
than 75% of the value of the commodity*; [provided that such warehouse
receipts shall be valued in accordance with the following:

(i) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the commodity
underlying either the futures contract sold or the futures contract which
is the subject of the call options sold, not more than 90% of the value of
the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(ii) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the futures
contract purchased or the put options sold, not more than 75% of the value
of the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(iii) if the warehouse receipt is for either: (A) deliverable grade of a
commodity other than the commodity underlying the futures contract or
option to be margined; or (B) a form of silver or gold not deliverable
under a futures contract, then not more than 75% of the value of the
warehouse receipt may be considered as margin.]

(f) physical commodities (but not forward contracts therefor) if the
carrying member is in possession and control of negotiable documents
covering such commodities, provided, however, that the value of such
commodities shall be based upon the contract market price for the grade of
such commodity or if the commodity is not of a grade deliverable on a
contract market, then at the price for the grade of such commodity on the
spot market;

(g) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account*,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be* issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members *or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.*

 (3) Calls issued by Member Firms for additional margin from customers may
only be met by: deposits conforming to the requirements of Rule 4.01(E)(1)
for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of
Rule 4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions
on either division of the Exchange, favorable market movements which, when
taken into consideration and combined with any other monies available,
enable the customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted
by a Member Firm carrying such account if the remaining funds in such
account are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin
required of the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal
request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must
be timely and complete. A Member Firm may call, at any time, for margins
above and beyond the minimums required by the Exchange. A Member Firm may
liquidate any or all positions maintained by a customer for failure to meet
a margin call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency
resulting therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may
vary for different commodities and may be changed from time to time by the
Board or its designee, and in the discretion of the Board or its designee,
may be made applicable to all open trades as well as new trades.

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position
is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month
which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to
purchase a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different
delivery month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject
to the rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage
position, each contract long and short must be carried by the same member
firm for the same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a
different exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an
arbitrage position.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for
arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions;
provided, however, that except for interdivision straddles, no such rate
shall be lower than the rates established for clearing members' margins.


Rule 9.05. MARGINS

*    *    *    *
(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:

(1) Cash (U.S. Currency);

Clearing House, representing securities issued by the Department of
Treasury of the United States of America maturing within ten (10) years

the United States Government; such securities shall be valued at ninety
five percent (95%) of the par value; or

(3) Subject to a maximum limit of 50% of the Clearing Member's total

the expiration date thereof (if the fifteenth day prior to the expiration
of the Letter of Credit is not a business day, the period during which such
Letter of Credit may not be used to meet original margin obligations shall
begin on the business day immediately preceding that day); and, provided
further, that on the business day!
!
 preceding the fifteenth calendar day prior to the expiration of the Letter
of Credit, the Clearing House shall issue a call for original margin to be
deposited in a form and manner acceptable to the Clearing House for
positions held open as of the close of business on that day and margined by
the Letter of Credit. The Clearing House shall have the unqualified right
to call on any Letter of Credit at any time prior to expiration.

CCA Rule 48. DEPOSIT OF SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT A ORIGINAL MARGIN
