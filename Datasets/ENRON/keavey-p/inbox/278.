What We're Reading[IMAGE]  War Letters : Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars 
by Andrew Carroll (Editor), Douglas Brinkley (Introduction)
 From a treasure trove of over 50,000 submissions, Andrew Carroll selected 150 letters, spanning 130 years of warfare from the Civil War to Bosnia, to create this remarkable collection. Most were written by uncelebrated but dearly loved soldiers from barracks, trenches, and flooded foxholes, as well as combat journalists, nurses, and family members on the home front. His rich sample testifies to the universal and poignant themes of love and honor, courage and rage, duty and fear and mortality. A major contribution to the understanding of war and its impact, and a powerful tribute to those undone by it.

by Hampton Sides
 In January 1945, 121 Army Rangers slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines to liberate 513 comrades--the last survivors of the Bataan Death March--being held in a concentration camp. In Ghost Soldiers, journalist Hampton Sides recounts both the hellish imprisonment as well as that daring rescue. Thrilling from start to finish, his book celebrates the heroism of hundreds of warriors, and brings renewed attention to one of the Rangers' finest hours.

by Michael Wood
 Following in the footsteps of the greatest Spanish adventurers, Michael Wood retraces the path of the conquistadors from Amazonia to Lake Titicaca, and from the deserts of North Mexico to the heights of Machu Picchu. Few stories in history match these conquests for sheer drama, endurance, and distances covered, and Wood's gripping narrative brings them fully to life. The stories in Conquistadors are not only of conquest, heroism, and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world, history and civilization, justice and human rights. --From the publisher

An Interview with Patrick O'Donnell[IMAGE]  Beyond Valor: World War II's Ranger and Airborne Veterans Reveal the Heart of Combat 
by Patrick K. O'Donnell
 A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his Web site, The Drop Zone, to solicit personal histories from individual soldiers willing to share their experiences. The result, Beyond Valor, is a moving and often brutal firsthand look at World War II from the perspective of Rangers and Airborne veterans. In an  interview with Amazon.com , O'Donnell explains the "hidden war" behind the official histories and why it's vital that such stories be told before they are lost forever.

History Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Close to Shore : A True Story of Terror in an Age of Innocence 
by Michael Capuzzo, Mike Capuzzo
 Michael Capuzzo tells the harrowing story of the real-life Jaws that helped inspire Peter Benchley's classic novel (and movie). Modern science now tells us that shark attacks are exceedingly rare and limited to just a few species. Yet they do occur, and one of the most terrifying episodes of fatal attacks occurred near the New Jersey shore in 1916, when a renegade great white shark went on a man-eating spree that left three adults and one boy dead. Good summer reading--but don't take it to the beach. 
  Our Price: $19.96  You Save: $4.99  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Wine and War : The French, the Nazis, and the Battle for France's Greatest Treasure 
by Don Kladstrup, et al
 It's a well-known fact that Adolf Hitler did not like wine. Still, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production. Wine and War recounts a fascinating and little-known subplot of World War II.
