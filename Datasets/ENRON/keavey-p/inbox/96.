Did you know that you can use merckmedco.com to order your prescriptions
online? Ordering online lets you take advantage of many benefits you don't
get when you refill through the mail, over the phone or even at your local
drugstore:

* Convenient add-to-cart features that let you order all your eligible
  prescriptions at the same time -- and our easy checkout makes payment a
  breeze!

* Easy access to up to 12 months of prescription history, so you and your
  health care professional will always know what medicines you've been taking.

* Brand-name and generic medication price comparisons that can save you money.

* A handy summary of recent prescription costs you can print for tax purposes
  or for flexible spending account reimbursement.

To start enjoying these services, all you need to do is update your
merckmedco.com online profile with a recent prescription number. Here's a
step-by-step guide (you may want to print this page now so you can refer to
the directions):

* Follow this link:
