rising fast) and New Zealand is popular for a racy, vibrant
style of Sauvignon Blanc. Uncork one of our picks below and

1999 Luca Syrah

this a wine to age.
4 stars

5. NYC Restaurants: Midtown Elegance, One Floor Down
====================================================

New York has noisy chefs and quiet chefs. Geoffrey Zakarian
is one of the quiet ones. But at his restaurant Town, he's
coming perilously close to making some noise, in a quiet
sort of way. (Three stars.)
