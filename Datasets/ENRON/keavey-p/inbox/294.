Self explanatory.

A class of elementary students started a class project to make a planter to
take home & wanted to have a plant in it that was easy to take care of, so
it was decided to use cactus plants. The students were given greenware
pottery of a clown planter & they painted them with glaze & had them
professionally fired at a class outing so they could see the process. It was
great fun. They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters & they
grew nicely but unfortunately were not allowed to take them home.
The cactus plants were removed & a small ivy replaced them & the children
were then allowed to take them home.
The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time..
