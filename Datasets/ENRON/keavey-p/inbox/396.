June 17 is Rabbit Day

The reviews are in and the race for best Father's Day gift
is won by a hare--the Rabbit Corkscrew. "Clever bunny!
Now there is the Rabbit--a fool-proof device...never mangles
or breaks a cork." (The New York Times, May 2000) Click for
more info on the Rabbit--the ultimate cork-pulling machine.

========================================================

Bobby Flay won the rematch against Masaharu Morimoto on the
Food Network's program "The Iron Chef," but he also
solidified his reputation as the John McEnroe of the
competitive food circuit.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Cabernet sauvignon is one red everyone seems to love. Here's
a selection of cabernets for all price ranges:

von Strasser Winery 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$50 - Don't listen to the talk of '98 as a mediocre vintage
in California. This is a classic Napa Valley cabernet with
the intensity of mountain-grown fruit and the telltale
opulence of von Strasser.
4 stars

Seven Hills Winery 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$28 - This Washington State winery is producing concentrated
and intense cabernets. Beautiful ripe fruit flavors are
backed up with touches of spice and a supple texture.
4 stars

Vina Carmen 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$15 - Chile is a country producing many affordable
cabernets. Try this organic wine, which is deep, intense and
full of unique minty character.
4 stars

4. Multimedia: Video Instruction for Preparing Salmon
=====================================================

Learn some of the less common and possibly more intimidating
approaches to salmon, such as curing, hot smoking and raw
marinating.

5. NYC Restaurants: Lutece Steps Into the Future
================================================

Lutece, under the new chef David Feau, is trying to project
a more contemporary image while retaining an old-fashioned
sense of luxury. William Grimes gives it two stars.

6. Readers' Opinions: Peppermills
=================================

From the superiority of ground pepper to matching wine with
food, readers share their insights and answer fellow
readers' questions.

Q. I have recently been told by a few friends that using a
peppermill is better than using pre-ground pepper. Are there
different kinds of peppercorns and how do you select what
kind to buy? -- LoisFEP

A. There is absolutely no comparison between freshly ground
peppercorns and the powdery stale stuff that comes in those
little cans. Going to a peppermill is probably one of the
best ways of making your cooking taste better. . . .
