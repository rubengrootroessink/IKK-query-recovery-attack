Dear PETER,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 2 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the
following URL link.  You can also copy and paste the URL into your
browser.
