One of Travel Agency in the Park's major phone lines has been damaged due to downtown construction.  The line is currently being repaired with an estimated down time of approximately 4-6 more hours.  Calls are currently being routed to 713-853-4801 and 713-345-5164.  We will send additional notification if this problem persists.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
