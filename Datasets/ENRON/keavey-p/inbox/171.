Construction project

The need for aggressive oil exploration and new electrical power plants
should be a bonanza for firms like Fluor that can manage such projects on a
global basis.

By Michael Sivy

It may seem hard to believe today, but back in the 1970s, one of the
hottest stock groups was Construction and Engineering. These C&E firms
managed mega-projects, including oil refineries and pipelines in the Middle
East, and were minting money because of the oil shortage. But during the
past decade, the energy crisis seemed like only a distant memory. And even
the best C&E firms, such as Fluor [FLR], ran into trouble.

For most of the late 1990s, Fluor's earnings were stagnant. The company
over-expanded in 1994 and subsequently began missing its growth targets. As
the problems got worse, the stock fell from a high of $75 a share in 1997
to less than $23 early last year.

To fix these problems, Fluor decided it would be smart to split the company
in half, separating its C&E businesses from its coal-mining operations,
which now trade as Massey Energy [MEE]. Since the split late last year,
Flour has been doing well and appears poised for even better times to come.

But this improved performance has gone unnoticed by many investors because
the division of the company and the shift of its reporting schedule from a
fiscal to a calendar year have made earnings comparisons difficult. In
fact, some research sources have stopped following the stock altogether.

That's a pity because the outlook for energy is better than it's been in a
decade. The scare of higher crude prices should greatly improve prospects
for oil projects, while electricity shortages in California -- and possibly
in other states as well -- will encourage the construction of power plants.
In fact, a joint venture between Duke Energy and Fluor is one of the
world's leading contractors and has the largest U.S. market share for the
construction of natural-gas-fired power plants. Two weeks ago, the
partnership was awarded a contract to help build two power plants in
Massachusetts.

Fluor's share price has climbed more than 50 percent since its
restructuring, and several major brokerages have upgraded the stock to a
"buy" on the strength of Fluor's improved business outlook.

At a current $51 a share, Fluor trades at 26 times this year's estimated
earnings. Profits are projected to gain 18 percent next year and then
continue to grow at a core annual rate of about 15 percent. And those
estimates could easily prove to be too low if the climate for energy turns
out to be more positive in the next five years than it has been in the past
five. And to me, that looks like a pretty good bet.
