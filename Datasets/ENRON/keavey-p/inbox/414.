Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has made bulk purchases of business books in
the past, you might be interested in our updated Training Store
--featuring business and development books for consultants,
trainers, and corporate professionals, as well as some special,
limited-time savings.

http://www.amazon.com/training/

Plus, to coincide with the upcoming annual meeting of the American
Society for Training & Development in Orlando, Florida, we've worked
with major business and training publishers to bring you the
best book selection and availability. You'll find titles from
Pfeiffer/Jossey-Bass, Berrett-Koehler, McGraw-Hill, and, of course,
the ASTD itself, most available to ship in 24 hours.

You'll find great deals, too--including, for a limited time, 40% off
such popular titles as "The Power of Six Sigma," "Brand Warfare,"
"Love 'Em or Lose 'Em," and "The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a
Leader." We're also taking 30% off other select titles and 10% off
the acclaimed Essential Managers series of short, helpful, and
easy-to-use guides to the modern workplace.

Don't wait for a meeting or trade show to get the hard-to-find books
you can use now. For all the titles you need to recruit, train, and
retain your best employees, check out our Training Store today.

Sincerely,

Charles Decker
Editor, Professional & Technical Books
