Very Cute! She looks just like a little trader :)

Things at Teco are kind of slow. They should pick up soon though. I will be interacting with some power marketers at Enron cause we just sent them an RFP. Do you know a guy named Ed Baughman or Billy Braddock? How are things over in the gas world ? Thanks for sending the pictures to me.
