TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule

DATE:
May 4, 2001
===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of
changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were
recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for
subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day
before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in
effect:

(1)  Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be
expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract
months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57("POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A ("END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
 (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks *

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall
mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week
Session trade.
