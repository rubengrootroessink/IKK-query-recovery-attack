Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Zinfandel has a cult following unlike any other grape
variety. We're not talking about the wimpy white kind,
either. Every January more than 5,000 Zinfandel fanatics
converge on San Francisco to taste the serious red stuff at
one of the largest tastings in the country. What's so great
about America's classic grape? Give these wines a try and
you'll see:

1998 Peterson Winery Bradford Mountain Zinfandel
$22 - Many Zins are known for their powerful,
take-no-prisoners style, but this lovely wine is elegant,
restrained and full of black cherry and plum flavors.
4 stars

1998 Ridge Vineyards Geyserville Zinfandel
$30 - If there's a first-growth of Zinfandel then Ridge tops
the list. Complete with all the spice and ripe fruit
Zinfandel is famous for, this wine is one for the cellar.
4 stars

1998 Pepperwood Grove Cabernet Franc
$7 - Zinfandel used to be one of the best-value reds around.
Not true anymore. But here's a wine that offers bright
blueberry flavors, good peppery spice notes and still
carries an affordable price tag.
3.5 stars

5. NYC Restaurants: Say 'Cheese' and Try Not to Smile
=====================================================

Artisanal, which gets two stars from William Grimes, is a
big, very good-looking brasserie with more varieties of
cheese than most human beings will encounter in a lifetime.

6. Readers' Opinions: The Perfect Barbecue Fire
===============================================

From building the perfect barbecue fire to the best methods
for saving open bottles of wine, readers share their
insights and answer fellow readers' questions.

Q. One of my family's GIANT outdoor grilling days is coming
up, and here's a problem that always troubles me: How do you
decide how many briquettes are going to be enough? How do
you know when the fire is hot enough to cook without
cremating? How do you get it to last until everything is
done? -- KennethRay

A. Those chimney-style fire starters work *really* well, and
you can have briquettes ready to go in a very short time . .
