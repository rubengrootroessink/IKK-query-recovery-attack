What We're Reading[IMAGE]  Pearl Harbor: The Day of Infamy - An Illustrated History 
by Dan Van Der Vat
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared December 7, 1941 as "A day that will live in infamy," the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, pulling the U.S. into World War II. This visually stunning book, by noted historian Dan van der Vat, features groundbreaking research, over 250 images, including previously unpublished personal photos from the perspective of both Americans on the ground and Japanese in the air, as well as a moment-by-moment breakdown of the attack. There are also numerous personal accounts, memorabilia, and illustrations by Tom Freeman. A major achievement.

by Tom Brokaw
 As he's done in his immensely popular Greatest Generation volumes, Tom Brokaw again celebrates the trials and triumphs of the Americans who experienced the Depression and World War II. Album of Memories is a collection of letters written to Brokaw by those who lived during this period, and in some cases, their children. Complete with photographs and memorabilia, the overall emotional impact of these letters is intense. To read them is both a moving experience and an opportunity to experience history at its most intimate.

by Dan Kurzman
 Just after 5 a.m. on April 18, 1906, an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale ripped through sleeping San Francisco, toppling buildings, exploding gas mains, and trapping thousands of citizens beneath tons of stone, broken wood, and twisted metal. Drawing on meticulously researched and eye-witness accounts, Dan Kurzman re-creates one of the most horrific events of the 20th century. More riveting than fiction but incredibly true, Disaster! is unforgettable history--a masterful account of the calamitous demise and astonishing resurrection of an American city. --From the publisher

History Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Time Lord : Sir Sanford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time 
by Clark Blaise
 The remarkable story of Sandford Fleming, the man who created and then convinced all the nations of the world to adopt a unified standard for telling time. Standard Time was one of the crowning achievements of Victorian progressiveness and one of the few Victorian innovations to have survived practically unchanged into our era. Few technological inventions have proven to be both as invisible and as important. In Time Lord, Clark Blaise introduces us to an almost-forgotten figure, who saw the world as a whole and overcame traditional and national objections to the rational accounting of time. --From the publisher
  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%)     [IMAGE]  April 1865 : The Month That Saved America 
by Jay Winik
 April 1865 is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Jay Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. This is a magnificent work--surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in some time.

by James Bamford
 A no-holds-barred examination of the National Security Agency packed with startling secrets about its past, newsbreaking revelations about its present-day activities, and chilling predictions about its future powers and reach. James Bamford first penetrated the wall of silence surrounding the NSA in 1982, with the much-talked-about bestseller, The Puzzle Palace. In Body of Secrets, he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and interviews with current and former officials. --From the publisher
