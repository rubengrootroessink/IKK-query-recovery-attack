1. Main Course: The Fish That Swam Uptown
=========================================

It took 75 years, and a name change, for a staple from
Manhattan's Lower East Side to become haute cuisine. Now
sablefish is known as black cod, and is a popular dish at
fancy restaurants like Daniel and Nobu.

The Minimalist: A Stir-Fry That Isn't

Mark Bittman says that preparing delicate soft tofu in a
stir-fry needn't be difficult. Ma-Po tofu (simmered tofu
with ground pork) is one way to do it right.

6. Readers' Opinions: Wines for a Vegetarian Barbecue
=====================================================

From stuffed pepper recipes to wines for a vegetarian
barbecue, readers share their insights and answer fellow
readers' questions.

Q. I'm going to have a barbecue. Most of the guests are
vegetarians. Menu is veggie burgers, grilled veggies, a
couple of great big salads and decadent creamy desserts
(including a cheesecake). I'm going to have some beer, but
I've noticed that most of the group drinks wine. What should
I offer them? Not too expensive please -- I want to please
them, not close a business deal. -- springinbloomBeth

A. You can get some terrific and crisp whites and medium to
light body reds for under $15 a bottle...
