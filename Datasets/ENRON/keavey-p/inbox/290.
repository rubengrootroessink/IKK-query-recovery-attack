Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

If you're looking for affordable Italian red wine, don't
automatically grab for a Chianti, try a bottle of Barbera.
Well-known examples come from Northern Italy and the region
of Barbera d'Alba, but California is also home to impressive
new bottlings.
See our WineGuide for more information:
http://winetoday.com/wineguide/encyclopedia/wg_encyclopedia_entry_174.html

1999 L'uvaggio Di Giacomo Il Gufo Barbera
$15 - This small Napa Valley producer makes one of the
hottest Barbera bottlings around. Juicy and supple, it's a
wine to enjoy immediately.
4 stars

1998 Easton, Shenandoah Valley, Barbera
$18 - A big league California Barbera with serious fruit
flavors. Ripe and full-bodied, this is an Italian-style red
meant for a side of beef hot off the grill.
4 stars

1998 Vajra, Barbera d'Alba
$15 - The real deal from Italy. Vibrant cherry flavors pair
with soft tannins in a wine that captures the essence of
good Barbera.
4 stars

4. Multimedia: A Visit to Manhattan's Aquavit
=============================================

In awarding Aquavit three stars, William Grimes comments
that Marcus Samuelsson, the restaurant's restlessly
inventive executive chef, is not the formula type. Go into
Samuelsson's kitchen in this week's restaurant video tour.

5. NYC Restaurants: A Rivalry Fought Out in Dueling Lobster
Rolls

6. Readers' Opinions: Creative Hamburger Cookery
================================================

From jazzing up plain hamburgers to storing Dom Perignon,
readers share their insights and answer fellow readers'
questions.

Q. Being somewhat "culinary disabled," I usually serve
ground beef in one of three ways: plain old broiled
hamburger, basic meatloaf with tomato sauce, and rice
meatballs, also made with plain old tomato sauce. I need to
get out of this rut. Anybody know of any exciting, creative
ways to prepare hamburger? -- Phoenix32890

A. I'll bet you that you never heard about this recipe . . .
