Dear Peter,
Pick Your Playground!
We have the cure for the summertime blues, and we'd like to share it 
with you: Get out and play! Isn't that what summer's all about? The 
kids in your life would agree, and so would the kid inside you. Now 
that you're an adult, you may not get three months of summer vacation. 
But on the other hand, the world's your playground. So go ahead--pick 
your playground! Whether you're looking for a romp in Mexico or the 
Caribbean, or fun in the sun in Orlando or Las Vegas, Travelocity can 
help make your vacation plans a reality. Destination Guides Reservations Engine

fabulous for water sports including diving, fishing, and sailing. 
There's also world-class golf. And after dark, the city throws a 
great party just about any night of the year. Don't let the town's 
small size fool you--there's enough fun here to fill a major city. Las Vegas Vacation in Style at Caesars Palace!

That, and picking a hotel! One property you can't go wrong with is Caesars Palace . Caesars celebrates the decadence of the Roman Empire
