the products and natgas options expire tomorrow (Friday may 25th)

as there is no access trade and certainly everybody will be leaving quickly
with the early close as Nymex closes at 1:00pm eastern Time (12:00pm CST)

okay to call in any changes in options strategy,, (abandoning calls or
puts) or (exercising out of the money calls or puts)
you will need to call Carr New York,,, the person is Jose Cardona
(212-453-6436)
the options full expiry is by 3:30pm EST and you really need to make any
changes by 3:00-3:15 EST
Jose will be awaiting your calls (if any) and it would help him if you had
your account # handy


thanks, enjoy your holiday
