Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.
