Dear Friend:

America has a serious energy shortage and President Bush has a comprehensive 
plan to address it.  Please follow this link to read the President's 
comprehensive energy plan as well as to view the speech he delivered 
yesterday in St. Paul, Minnesota: http://www.BushEnergy.com.

The President's plan to produce more reliable, affordable and environmentally 
clean energy is built on three core principles:

--The plan is comprehensive and forward looking.

--It uses 21st century technology to allow us to promote conservation and 
diversify our energy supply.

--The plan will increase the quality of life of Americans by providing 
reliable energy and protecting the environment.

While President Bush is showing strong leadership on a long neglected 
problem, some want to protect the status quo of higher prices, less supply 
and more neglect.  WE NEED YOU TO HELP PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN BY:

1. Writing a letter to the editor about the President's comprehensive energy 
plan.  Go to http://www.BushEnergy.com for sample letters and your 
newspaper's address.

2. Calling talk radio in your area to discuss the President's leadership on 
the energy issue.  Visit http://www.BushEnergy.com for contact numbers.

3. Forwarding this message to five friends

4. Call your Congressman and Senators to urge them to support the President's 
plan.  For contact numbers, go to http://www.BushEnergy.com.

You can also help Republican National Committee efforts to pass the 
President's comprehensive energy plan.  Please make an online contribution 
today by using this secure link:
