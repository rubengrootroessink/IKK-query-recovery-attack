David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the 
policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't 
think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so 
the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to 
come. Rick

I would like to make the temperary VAR permanent.  I would give most to gas 
and some to power.  I feel like its the best place in the company for it.

Please let me know.
