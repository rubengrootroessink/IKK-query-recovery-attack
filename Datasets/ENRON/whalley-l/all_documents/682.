Kiodex Appoints Two New Members to Senior Management
  11/14/2000 

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 14, 2000-- Kiodex Inc., a provider of 
technology-based trading and risk-management solutions for the commodities 
markets, recently added two new members to its senior management team: Raj 
Vaswani, Vice President and General Counsel and Thomas Farley, Chief 
Financial Officer. Mr. Vaswani will develop and manage the company's legal 
and regulatory strategies. Mr. Farley will manage the company's finance and 
accounting functions. 

"Having worked with countless high-flying technology companies, Kiodex 
impresses me as being the cream of the crop," said Vaswani. " Kiodex is 
without peer in its vision to deliver risk management and trading services to 
the marketplace."

Raj Vaswani comes to Kiodex from Morrison & Foerster LLP in New York, one of 
the leading new-media law firms, where he was an attorney in the Technology 
Transactions Group and specialized in corporate and intellectual property 
transactions for high-technology companies, including public equity 
offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and software-development transactions. 
Recently profiled in the New York Law Journal, Mr. Vaswani is a well-regarded 
attorney in the field of new media and has authored numerous articles 
regarding the legal aspects of emerging high-technology businesses. 

Thomas Farley joins Kiodex from Gryphon Investors, an investment firm 
specializing in leveraged acquisitions of and growth equity investments in 
high-growth, middle-market companies. Mr. Farley found and evaluated 
acquisition candidates, executed transactions, monitored investment 
portfolios, and directly supplemented the management of several portfolio 
companies. Previously, Mr. Farley worked for Montgomery Securities (now Banc 
of America Securities) where he was a corporate finance investment banker 
advising high-growth middle- and large-market companies. 

" Kiodex compares favorably to the many early-stage technology companies that 
I worked with previously," noted Farley. "The company's position as a 
nuts-and-bolts technology provider with a proprietary solution and a superb 
management team made my decision to join the company an easy one." 
"We are thrilled at these two new additions to our management team at Kiodex 
. Their decision to join us marks our transition to a new stage of growth," 
stated R. Martin Chavez, CEO. "The high-tech expertise Mr. Vaswani gained 
while at Morrison & Foerster makes him the ideal leader of our legal and 
regulatory strategies; moreover, Raj has been with us as outside counsel 
since the inception of Kiodex . Tom, with his hands-on experience at 
Gryphon's portfolio companies, will plan our path to profitability and embed 
planning, budgeting, and forecasting into our DNA at Kiodex ."

The world's largest Internet-based exchange for petrochemicals and industrial 
gases, ChemConnect Inc., snapped up leading traditional U.S. brokerage firm, 
Universal Chemical Brokerage Ltd. (UCB) last week. At the same time, 
ChemConnect announced the launch of its World Chemical Exchange commodities 
trading floor.

Plans are to integrate New York-based UCB?a dominant player in U.S. spot 
market petrochemical brokering that places traditional broker trades by 
phone?with ChemConnect's Internet trading service. The move will enable UCB 
to help clients online or offline on the new Commodities Floor of the World 
Chemical Exchange, allowing them to post their own buy or sell offers either 
electronically or offline through brokers.

The new Commodities Floor will allow pre-qualified members to buy, sell and 
exchange standard high volume commodity products over the Internet in real 
time through trading hubs in Antwerp-Rotterdam, Singapore and Houston. 
Established trading pits include methanol and MTBE as well as several other 
petrochemicals.

The Commodities Floor offers more than $1 billion/yr in notional sales value, 
while the addition of UCB immediately gives the floor added trading liquidity 
for petrochemicals, said the company. "ChemConnect intends to further expand 
its capacity, reach and services to include the development of financial 
derivatives market."

NetworkOil's SurplusExchange sets fast pace 

HOUSTON, Nov. 13 (LocalBusiness.com) -- NetworkOil Inc. today announced its 
Surplus Exchange has sold $20 million worth of oilfield equipment since it 
was launched three months ago, which an analyst from the Yankee Group calls a 
"pretty good" volume for the energy exchange arena. 

"NetworkOil is a pretty big player in its niche market," Randall Nottingham, 
senior analyst of the Yankee Group's energy and Internet strategies practice, 
told LocalBusiness.com during a telephone interview from his Boston office 
today. The Yankee Group is a technology research and consulting service. 

He estimated a market "in the hundreds of millions of dollars" annually for 
the auctioning of used or surplus industrial equipment, adding that he had no 
figures available on the size of the market specifically for the oil and gas 
industry. 

The NetworkOil Surplus Exchange uses the Internet to enhance market liquidity 
for the sellers of surplus equipment in the oil and natural gas industry. It 
also exposes the equipment to potential buyers globally, giving them better 
knowledge of what is available on the market, Nottingham said. 

"Sellers are reaching more buyers through the SurplusExchange and maximizing 
the realized value of their assets," Stuart Page, NetworkOil CEO said in a 
news release. "NetworkOil is addressing business needs, and the oil and gas 
industry is responding." 

Nottingham said NetworkOil uses both the Internet auction and the traditional 
auction in its business model. "It's not the E-Bay model of showing a picture 
and expecting people to bid on it." He praised Network Oil's acquisition in 
August of the San Antonio-based Premier Auctioneers International. 

Since then, NetworkOil and Premier Auctioneers have conducted eight live 
call-out auctions and four Internet auctions. The SurplusExchange currently 
lists more than $50 million of oilfield equipment. 

Twenty sales professions work directly with sellers to take an inventory of 
the equipment and conduct appraisals, and they also conduct equipment 
searchers for buyers. 

"Selling equipment through NetworkOil Surplus Exchange exceeded our 
expectations," said David Sims, materials manager of Kerr-McGee Corp. in 
Dallas. "NetworkOil gave us exposure to a whole new set of buyers who had an 
aggressive interest in our pumping units." 

NetworkOil is an independent e-commerce marketplace for new and used 
petroleum equipment. Thirty-two oil and gas companies and four major venture 
capital firms have invested in the company.

Two local firms in marketing pact
Nov 14, 2000 02:06 PM ET 

HOUSTON, Nov. 14 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Two local online sites focusing on 
the energy industry today said they have signed a joint marketing to enlarge 
their offerings and expand audiences. 

The Oil & Gas Journal Exchange's Global Equipment Exchange, a trading 
exchange for new and used equipment, said it will work with FlashFind Corp., 
which offers technical operational, repair and safety information at its 
site. 

"In many cases manuals and other product documentation are lost during the 
life of the equipment," said Dehorah Peppers, chairman of FlashFind. 

Peppers said Oil & Gas Journal Exchange customers will be able to buy 
equipment and "be sure that they will have access to all the documentation 
needed to operate and maintain it." 

Founded in 1997, FlashFind also provides links to a number of ecommerce and 
procurement systems and research services. 

For Oil & Gas Exchange, the agreement simply increases the amount of content 
available to customers shopping for equipment. 

Global Equipment Exchange, formerly Global Logistics Partners, was acquired 
by San Mateo, Calif.-based pennNET in March. The company has been trading new 
and surplus oilfield and electric power equipment since 1991. PennNET was 
created to electronically leverage the resources of Tulsa, Okla.-based 
PennWell Corp.
