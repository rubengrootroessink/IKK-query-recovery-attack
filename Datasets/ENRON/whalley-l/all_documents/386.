The Texas eCommerce Association, in partnership with the The Texas Business 
Journals and BusinessWeek, plan to recognize and honor Texas' ten most 
innovative and influential eCommerce leaders.  Nominations are due by 
February 2, 2001 and the recipients will be announced at a banquet on March 
24, 2001.

I believe it would be appropriate to nominate Louise Kitchen for her work 
with EnronOnline.  If you are in agreement, please advise, so I can begin the 
process of completing the application.  The application consists of a 
250-word abstract describing the nominee's direct contribution to the 
eCommerce industry in Texas, along with the nominee's contact information and 
a 100-word biography.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053.
