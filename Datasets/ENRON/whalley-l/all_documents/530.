o Crosspoint Confirms It is Delaying $1 Billion Fund

WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Crosspoint Venture Partners
confirmed reports that it has postponed its ninth
fund, which had commitments totaling over $1 billion.
The company cited the dip in the stock market; market
congestion for young companies; and a concern that
good companies will have a hard time in the current
market as the main reasons for the postponement.
The firm said it wants to make sure it generates
returns its limited partners are used to getting.
Crosspoint said there is enough money in its $854
million 2000 fund to finance a few new companies
should it see fit, but will now mainly focus on
bringing its existing young companies to profitability.
The firm said it plans to continue with the fund
at an undetermined point in the future and expects
that its committed limited partners will continue
with the firm.
