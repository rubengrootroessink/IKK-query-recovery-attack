Attached is a draft press release regarding the deal between EnronOnline and 
TrueQuote.  This is a follow-up to last year's announcement.  The system is 
being tested today.  If the testing goes as planned, they expect to release 
this when the system goes live next week, which could be as early as Monday, 
June 4.

If you have any comments, please forward to me by Monday, June 4 at 10:00 
am.  Thanks.

Eric
