HoustonTexans.com Weekly Update
Nov. 17, 2000

HELPING HANDS
The Texans celebrated the conclusion of their 2000 United Way Campaign at
Pennzoil Place Thursday. And the results were just what Texans Owner Bob
McNair was seeking when he launched the campaign a month ago. All 71 Texans
employees contributed. Seven donated $10,000 or more. McNair and his wife
Janice matched the total contribution of the club, bringing the Texans'
total to $205,000.

"Thank you so much for helping us be a part of your team," said Jacqueline
S. Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. "For you to
believe so much in our mission to impact the community is overwhelming. I am
floored with the 100 percent participation. It is absolutely unheard of."

The McNairs are no stranger to the United Way, but the team gives them a
more visible platform for their charitable work.

"We're delighted with everyone's participation," Bob McNair said. "It was a
tremendous team effort."

The NFL has worked with the United Way for the past quarter-century, using
its players, coaches and staff to help member cities and their surrounding
communities.

OUT AND ABOUT
Texans Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly visited the
University of Nebraska earlier this week. He heads to the Meadowlands Sunday
to scout the Giants-Lions game.

REALIGNMENT TALKS
Representatives from 17 NFL teams met in Denver Wednesday for discussions on
realignment for the 2002 season, when the Texans hit the field. The NFL will
expand to eight four-team divisions in 2002, placing the Texans in the AFC.
Houston -- as well as transplanted teams in Baltimore, St. Louis and
Tennessee -- does not have a vote in the realignment proposal.

"Those were preliminary discussions in Denver this week," Casserly says.
"There will be a meeting in mid-January just on the realignment issue. The
league has set June as a target date for realignment to be finalized."

NOVEMBER SHOWERS BRING ... STADIUMS?
Despite the rain, construction continues at Reliant Stadium. As of
mid-November, 375,215 square feet of elevated deck had been poured. Most of
the work is still on the west side, where 14 super columns have been
installed. The super truss steel erection on the west side will start Dec.
6. More than 500 employees are currently working on the project. Looking for
more info on the stadium? Check out the stadium section on
