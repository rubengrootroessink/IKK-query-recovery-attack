Greg,
 I am a '95 grad now working with EECC after five years of being an armor 
officer.  I just recently made my transition and I am exploring what 
direction I would like to take within the corporate arena.  I  was wondering 
if you could take some time to share some information about your business 
unit, experiences, and any suggestions you may have for someone in my 
situation.   I hope to hear from you soon.

Happy Holidays!
