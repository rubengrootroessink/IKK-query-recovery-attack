Hi Greg,
 Just bugging you again about whether or not you'd called Andrew Lawrence at
Longitude.  This is a very interesting and different approach to trading
products (I'm on the board of Longitude, for your information, and I got on
the board because of the very intriguing proposal they have).  I hope you
get a chance to talk with him.  Cheers.  Wendy  PS I have a board meeting
tomorrow afternoon -- we meet every month.
