Iridium satellites may go down in flames 
Iridium, a U.S. satellite telephone company operating under bankruptcy 
protection, is on the verge of one
   of the most spectacular business flameouts ever--literally set to burn up 
billions of dollars' worth of
 Earth-orbiting assets.  Barring the last-minute arrival of a qualified 
buyer, the company plans to begin
 "de-orbiting" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit 
system for wireless telephone service.  
 That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported 
to have cost $5 billion to $7
billion--would be vaporized as its satellites, bumped by their thrusters, 
plunge from 485 miles (781 km)
 above the Earth to burn up over the ocean.

E-commerce firms hip to B2B before it was hot 
   Business-to-business e-commerce is all the rage these days, but a few 
consumer e-commerce companies such as eBay
   entered the market before it was hot.   The leading auction house opened a 
small-business exchange today
 where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But 
the move is more of a change in marketing
 than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been 
quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its
 format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as 
AutoExchange and Chemdex.

NetTrends: Battle of the E-Marketplace
 Everybody wants to be a marketplace.
In sectors from cars to chemicals to food ingredients, companies are trying 
to join all of
 the participants into Internet-based markets for their industries in hopes 
of making businesses more efficient.
In some cases, they're taking the idea a step further, setting up virtual 
markets that
collect fees for all of the goods traded, creating what they hope are highly 
valued companies in the process.
Agricultural giant Cargill was the latest to join the trend, creating a 
market for the $300 billion food industry this week. The Big
Three automakers recently launched a combined e-commerce venture for auto 
parts ordering that they said would handle $500
billion in parts ranging from glass to semiconductors.
