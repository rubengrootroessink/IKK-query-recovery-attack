o Ventro shutting down two b-to-b marketplaces

Ventro (VNTR) is shutting down its two wholly owned b-to-b marketplaces -- 
Chemdex and Promedix-- after efforts to find buyers failed, the company 
disclosed today.  The beleaguered operator of online marketplaces, which had 
previously disclosed efforts to sell Chemdex and Promedix as part of a 
broader corporate restructuring, said today that those efforts had failed, 
forcing today's actions. The shutdowns will begin Dec. 31 and will force 
Ventro to fire about 235 workers. The company expects to record aggregate 
restructuring charges of about $380 million to $410 million in its fiscal 
year-end results in connection with the closures. Ventro shares were trading 
up 62 cents to $2.50 in midday trading today.  Chemdex operates an online 
marketplace for the life sciences industry, while Promedix is a marketplace 
focused on high-end medical equipment. Over the past six months, Ventro has 
struggled to convince buyers and sellers to conduct business through these 
marketplaces, leading to disappointing financial results and a steep drop in 
the company's stock price. In October, Ventro CEO Dave Perry announced plans 
for a major restructuring, which would involve selling off stakes in the 
company's marketplaces, and transform the company into a provider of services 
for b-to-b marketplaces.  But sources familiar with Ventro's restructuring 
plans say efforts to sell Chemdex and Promedix fell on deaf ears from 
potential suitors because the company could not overcome two big hurdles. 
First, potential buyers were turned off by the poor performance of the two 
marketplaces. Second, and more importantly, Ventro was pushing unattractive 
sale terms, sources say, including a requirement that any marketplace buyer 
enter into a long-term services contract with Ventro estimated to be worth 
between $10 million and $20 million a year. "This was a big hurdle for 
buyers," a source familiar with the Ventro's sale efforts said. "No one 
wanted to pay for the marketplaces, then be forced to hire Ventro to run 
them."  Ventro executives are holding a conference call later today to 
discuss this announcement; it is expected that executives will push the 
positive of the shutdowns. Ventro says that future cash outlays for operating 
activities will be reduced by 50 percent after Chemdex and Promedix are 
shuttered, which should put Ventro on a stronger financial footing as it 
struggles to survive.
