   Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based
     Employee Referral Program.

     This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs.
     Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of
     quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals
     stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through
     other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee
     referral program with less work and better results.

     There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is
     hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

     So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and
     help us realize our mission of being the?World's No. 1?Company.

     Check out the site - let us know what you think -- we want to hear
     from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if
     you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail
     (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713)
     345-3254, option 2.
