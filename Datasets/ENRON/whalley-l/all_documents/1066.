Greg, 
I want to thank you for the time you took out of your day to meet with me  
Tues. evening. ?It was nice to meet you and share some very good wine with  
Donny. 
We continue to provide execution for a number of your traders on the NYMEX,  
which we appreciate very much. ?As you know most of our money is made  
clearing trades and would apperciate the opportunity to clear Enron's trades  
once again. ? 

If I can ever do anything for you in the NYMEX arena I would love to. ?You  
can reach me at 713-266-0050 of on the Yahoo IM at s_vankeppel. ?Many thanks  
again for your time.
