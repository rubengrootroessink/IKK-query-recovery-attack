Good afternoon Jessica,

As per my conversation with Wharton today, confirming Mr. Whalley's 
attendance as a speaker at the Wharton Journalist Conference on December 
13th, they are requesting the following information from Mr. Whalley:

bio
presentation in electronic format to include 'Enron' tab in binder as an 
insert for guests
any type of company insert to be included in 'Enron' tab section of the 
binder (i.e. the attached fact sheet or Enron history)
his needs during the presentation (i.e. overhead projector, LDC panel for 
laptop presentation, etc.)

Please provide me with this information on Monday, so I can email it to 
Wharton.  Also, as discussed, prior to Mr. Whalley leaving we will print off 
a number of presentations and FEDEX them to Wharton for distribution.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey
