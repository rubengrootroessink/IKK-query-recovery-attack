Hi Greg!

Would you consider doing this?  If so, I'll have John McMillan call you 
directly.

Thanks!

Dear Christie:

John Roberts suggested I contact you. As I believe he told you, I am running
an MBA course next quarter entitled "Market Design," in which I will examine
how markets are built (ranging from eBay to reforming Russia). Enron, of
course, is a leader in creating markets, so it would be great if someone
from Enron could lead a session.  (650 724 4549) .

Thank you very much.

Regards,
John
