Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Dynetek, which develops, manufactures, and markets lightweight fuel
storage systems, announced that its newest fuel storage system (5000 psi)
would increase the range of fuel cell vehicles by over 30% relative to
current designs.
* California Governor Gray Davis signed a bill in late September
creating incentives for the purchase or lease of new zero emission vehicles
(ZEV).  While the details of the program are to be proposed on December 7th
and 8th in Sacremento, individual grants of up to $9,000 over three years
($3,000 per year) may be offered to consumers, both private and public, who
purchase or lease ZEVs.
* Innogy Technology Ventures received approval from the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) to build a regenerative fuel cell power plant in
Mississippi using the company's Regenesys technology.  A regenerative fuel
cell stores and releases electrical energy through a reversible
electrochemical reaction using two salt electrolytes.
