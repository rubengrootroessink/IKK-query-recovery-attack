Dear Echampion,

The situation in Florida is an outrage.  And it is getting worse.  The RNC 
urgently needs your help today.

Over the weekend, Al Gore's campaign has waged an all-out effort to 
disqualify military absentee ballots and almost succeeded in throwing out 
over 1400 in all.  Military absentees were running heavily in favor of 
Governor Bush - so they became a "shoot-to-kill" target for win-at-all-costs 
Democrat operatives.

The articles below, one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York 
Post, amply demonstrate this "Democratic vote scheme."

The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide.  A leaked five 
page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details -- precise instructions to 
Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on 
technicalities.  And as the ballots were counted in one county, the Chicago 
Sun Times source noted:

"Gore had five attorneys there.  Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote.  Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter.  They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality."

Such tactics are shameful.  This has been an exceptionally close election.  
On Election Day, George W. Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast 
and counted ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of 
the Electoral College.

Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting 
Democrat judges to rewrite Florida's election laws after the fact to permit 
partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots.  That is 
bad enough -- but to selectively target our men and women in uniform purely 
in order to knock out a few hundred more votes for George Bush is beneath 
contempt.

We URGENTLY need your help today!  Please:

1) Make as generous a contribution as you can to the RNC's Fair Elections 
Fund, by following this link: 
https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=MFBWXSUVZGCH

(If you want to contribute by check, you can print out a donor form through 
this link:
http://www.rncfc.org/econtributor/mailcheck2.htm)

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. Let them know that this recent ploy by the Gore campaign is an 
outrageous insult to the men and women of our Armed Forces (you can get the 
addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people 
and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

3) Call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your 
strong views on this issue

4) Write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on this important subject

5.) Finally, forward this  e-mail to your own e-mail list - to all of your 
friends and neighbors who care about our men and women overseas and want the 
truth to come out in Florida

This battle SHOULD be over.  George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won on November 
7.  But because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, the fight goes on.  
Please help the RNC give Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney the support they 
need.


Sincerely,

Jim Nicholson
Chairman

NEWS ARTICLES:

Democrats' vote scheme
November 20, 2000
BY ROBERT NOVAK SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST
WASHINGTON--It was 4:30 a.m. in Jacksonville, Fla., Saturday when two 
Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each 
other. The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee 
ballots of 44 U.S. service personnel. Their defect: no postmarks.

The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by 
Republicans, an irony reflective of the fight for Florida. Befuddled 
Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats, following the letter of the 
law. Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win 
Florida--and the presidency. While granting maximum latitude in divining 
intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast, the 
predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country 
abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude.
When Al Gore and George W. Bush finished in a Florida dead heat, Republicans 
viewed it like a normal recount. Democrats, in contrast, treated it like a 
continuation of the 2000 campaign.

Gore's operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic. They 
calculated that the 300-vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine 
recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gore's deficit 
on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed 1,000 votes. The Gore campaign 
worked to make sure that did not happen.

Mark Herron, a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the 
Gore campaign legal effort, last Wednesday sent off a five-page letter to 
colleagues around the state addressed to "FDP (Florida Democratic Party) 
Lawyer." The subject: "Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest." It 
amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the serviceman's vote.

It worked. In Jacksonville, officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft 
carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a 
postmark. Consequently, plenty of sailors lost their vote at 4:30 Saturday 
morning (including, for example, Donnie Haynes, Michael Gentry and Clifford 
Shearer from the USS George Washington).

Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at 11:30 p.m. Friday 
after seven and one-half hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this 
memo:
"Gore had five attorneys there. Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote. Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter. They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality."

In Broward County, 92 overseas ballots were accepted and 304 rejected. In 
Miami-Dade County, 110 out of 113 were turned down. Statewide, 2,203 ballots 
were accepted and 1,420 rejected. As a result, Bush's net overseas gain was 
only 630, for an overall Florida lead of 930.

That meant only 930 votes need be won by Gore in the hand-counting of heavily 
Democratic Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. They were working 
hard at it. David Fulcher, a lawyer from Jackson, Miss., sent to Palm Beach 
to help out, described to me a scene of chaos and confusion--of Bush ballots 
put in the Gore pile, followed by protests and arguments.

It became clear at midweek, however, that Palm Beach would not yield enough 
new Gore votes. Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in 
Broward and Miami-Dade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand 
recounts. But late Saturday, when Gore planners became concerned about 
surpassing the 930-vote margin in the three counties, the rules were suddenly 
changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who 
failed to make a hole in the punch card.

THE FLORIDA CIRCUS: HAS AL NO DECENCY?
John Podhoretz
The New York Post
Sunday,November 19,2000

IF the "butterfly ballot" in Florida's Palm Beach County had led to the 
disqualification of 40 percent of the county's presidential votes, 
Republicans wouldn't be protesting the manual recount there. There would have 
been no question in everyone's mind that some combination of ballot 
irregularity, manipulation and outright fraud had taken place. But only 5 
percent of the Palm Beach ballots were invalidated.

It now appears that 40 percent of Florida's overseas ballots have been 
invalidated. Democrats are convinced that their outrage on behalf of Al Gore 
and his position as the supposedly "true" winner of Florida is justified 
largely because of the furor that arose on the day after the election from 
the butterfly-ballot controversy.

How do they feel, today, knowing that - let me say it again, and in bold-face 
type: Forty percent of Florida's overseas ballots have been invalidated?

It also appears that most of those invalidated votes came from enlistees in 
the U.S. military as the result of a coordinated Democratic strategy designed 
by Tallahassee lawyer Mark Herron, who is involved in various Gore voter 
lawsuits.

Here's what this means: Al Gore, who is by all accounts totally and 
intimately involved in every aspect of the process underway in Florida, may 
well have approved an effort to challenge every absentee vote in Florida cast 
by the servicemen and servicewomen whose commander-in-chief he will become if 
he is sworn in as president.

I have no doubt that the challenges are legal. Florida tightened its 
absentee-vote procedures after massive fraud in 1998 led to the illegitimate 
election of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez - whom a judge removed from office when 
the extent of his campaign's grave offense against the U.S. electoral system 
became clear.

Republicans, who have been hewing to the letter of the law in making their 
argument against the hand recounts in four Democratic counties, are not 
exactly in a position to argue for greater leniency on these military 
ballots. Such an affirmative-action claim would make a mockery of George W. 
Bush's own argument in federal court that the hand count violates the 14th 
amendment's equal-protection clause.
But the Gore campaign's conduct makes an even greater mockery of the vice 
president's insistence on a "full, fair and accurate count." Again - this 
cannot be said often enough - 40 percent of the overseas and absentee ballots 
have been invalidated as a direct result of a Democratic strategy intended to 
benefit the vice president.

Republicans will be falling all over themselves to accuse the vice president 
of "hypocrisy," which is becoming the most tiresome game of this 
post-election season. Let me stipulate that there is indeed hypocrisy on both 
sides.
The real issue in the matter of the absentee ballots is the very deep and 
very, very dark cynicism of Gore's efforts to make himself president. In 
pursuit of this ambition imprinted on him at birth, Al Gore really is willing 
to do just about anything.

The vice president has now proved himself capable of actively seeking the 
disenfranchisement of military voters out of fear that they might have voted 
for his rival (the challenges had to be issued before the envelopes were 
opened). None of those Florida residents can now be sure that his or her vote 
was ever counted.
