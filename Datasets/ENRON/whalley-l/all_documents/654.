RedMeteor.com takes exchange to former Soviet Union

HOUSTON, Nov. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- RedMeteor.com, an Internet-based 
commodities exchange, today announced it was selected to provide a modified 
energy exchange platform to Energy Trade System, a venture uniting a group of 
key energy players in the former Soviet Union. 

The platform will allow Energy Trade to launch trading platforms for refined 
products exported through the Baltic Sea ports. 

Energy Trade System's founding partners are Sibneft, the Russian Ministry of 
Railways, pipeline operator Transneft, product pipeline operator 
Transnefteproduct and fiber optic cable operator TransTeleCom Company. 

This agreement promotes the Houston-based RedMeteor's trading platform and 
extends its technical capacity in enabling energy and non-energy commodity 
trading platforms globally. 

"We are very pleased to provide platform licensing and hosting services to 
ETS," Vincent DiCosimo said in a news release. "RedMeteor's platform 
configuration is designed to be highly scalable and capable of adapting to 
any commodity type quickly. This transaction confirms our expectations in 
that regard." 

Sibneft President Eugene Shvidler said the "agreement with RedMeteor will 
help ETS meet its goal of providing round-the-clock reliability, ease of use, 
superior response time and the best transaction security available." 

"Through the creation of new Internet-based platforms, ETS aims to 
revolutionize the way that energy is bought and sold, both in FSU export 
markets and on the Russian domestic market," Shvidler said in a news release. 

Sibneft is a Russian oil company with operations spanning exploration, 
production, refining and marketing of petroleum products. Sibneft produces 
some 330,000 barrels per day from fields in Western Siberia. The company also 
is affiliated with the 385,000 barrel per day Omsk refinery. 

RedMeteor.com is a global, Internet-based, exchange marketplace for crude 
oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and electricity.

Itochu,APX To Start Online Pwr Bourse In Japan Spring '01
11/16/2000 

SEOUL -(Dow Jones)- Itochu Corp. (J.CIT) of Japan and Automated Power 
Exchange (X.AUP) of the U.S. will jointly launch their Web-based exchange for 
retail electricity trade in Japan in the spring of next year, Shinichi 
Aburaya, project manager for Itochu's power projects group told Dow Jones 
Newswires Thursday. 

The online exchange was originally scheduled to start in November this year.

Frank Lim, director of marketing in Asia for APX, said the delay wasn't due 
to technical problems. 

"We are clearing commercial and technical regulatory milestones one by one," 
Aburaya said, on the sidelines of the Energy North Asia 2000 conference in 
Seoul. 

Aburaya said the Web-based exchange is expected to start limited services in 
the first quarter of 2001. It will offer the full range of planned services 
later next year, he added. 

Using a patent-pending online trading system, the exchange will match sellers 
holding excess electricity with potential buyers. A seller will input 
information required for the sale - the electricity volume, an offer price, 
and the timing of the delivery of the power supply. 

Buyers can seek desirable terms and conditions on the Web site. 

Itochu and APX aim to lure market participants ranging from power and gas 
utilities to trading houses, department stores and banks. 

The move to create an online power exchange is part of the two companies' 
efforts to take advantage of the new freedom in Japan's electricity industry, 
after deregulation last spring ended a 50-year monopoly for regional power 
utilities. 

Under reforms implemented March 21, newcomers are allowed to sell retail 
electricity directly to high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial 
users, which together account for roughly 28% of Japan's total power demand. 

During his address at the Energy North Asia 2000 conference, Aburaya said 
Itochu and APX plan to provide the following services on their online 
electricity exchange: industry and deregulation news; consulting services on 
effective use of surplus power capacity, procurement guidance, and grid 
connection assistance. 

He said the online exchange will eventually evolve to offer shorter-term 
contracts. 

"Over time, we hope to meet market needs in the gradual progress of 
deregulation..." Aburaya said. "Now, only yearlong contracts are practical, 
but we plan to offer quarterly, monthly, weekly, day-ahead and one-hour 
blocks." 

Itochu and APX also plan to offer services to deal with credit management, 
payment, and billing issues, he said. 

"These planned services will come a little bit later," Aburaya said. 

Itochu and APX are inviting utility companies and others to invest in their 
venture, tentatively called JPX. Itochu plans to hold a 20% to 25% stake in 
JPX. 

Aburaya said his company continues seeking investors in the project.
