Greg,

You bought 365 27-31 strangles and 1,000 28-30 strangles. Out of 1,000, I 
filled you 300 times internally at the same price that I was paying on the 
floor. I input this internal trade too late for it to get into your report. 
So you will see only 700 lots, the other 300 lots will show up on Friday. 
That means that you are about 33 contracts longer in July. Sorry about that.
