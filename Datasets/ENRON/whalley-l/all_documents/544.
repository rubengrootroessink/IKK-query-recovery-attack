=09=09Q: What will make a manager succeed at Corning?
=09=09A: Let's say you know how to manage a [research and development] envi=

people. Again, that goes back to the culture. We want people who are invest=

=09=09
=09=09Q: How do you get at those skills when interviewing applicants?
=09=09A: If I get a manager from another company, I might ask what their=20
involvement has been in diversity initiatives. I would ask them to outline=
=20
their efforts around performance management. Time and again, you'll get=20
someone who has been extremely successful in managing a technical group, bu=

you get the sense that they're going to do that at the cost of some=20

company said they would request a tranfer to their department on my behalf,=

but it had to be cleared with my supervisor first. =20
=09=09
=09=09Well, she told me that for the position I wanted I would have to go  =

and not a 12-year plan, she told me she simply would  not approve my=20

=09=09

I am trying to define my career goals: I'm interested in Finance  and its=

role in investing in emerging markets, etc. Many graduate programs  offer=

joint programs (MBA with Master in International Affairs, or with  Masters =

even look at your resume without a second degree or PHD. So  I wonder why=

you will do well. And good luck with your plans. Two  years will just fly.
