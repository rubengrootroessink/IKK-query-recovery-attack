Greg,
See note below for detail but here is the exec summary.

We had a couple of big shifts on the curves yesterday which I want you to be 
aware of.  We wanted to put several major adjustments through on the same 
day.  The main moves are as follows:

Increased gas volatility - we moved the curve up significantly for the first 
several years. Lose o16mm
Power Peaks down, off-peaks up across the whole curve.    Gain o10mm

Because "structured Derivatives" is a separate line item, this book loses 
$43mm today, with power making approx $40mm to off-set.  The $43mm may need 
to be reported to Skilling, even though the real loss is just the gas loss of 
o16mm.

(There were several other clear up items put through, but the above 
represents the main issues to be aware of.  Net on the day we are up, and 
still expect to hit Q4 targets.).

Regards

Richard

Subject: UK Power Actual P&L results

We have now substantially calculated and confirmed the various line 
adjustments we have been working on with commercial over the past few weeks. 
The attached spread sheet shows the actual numbers (one number still to 
determine finally) against forecast. The main changes were as a result of the 
curves we used being a few days out of date and the front end of the live 
curve having moved from the scenario curves. Dates are included for when the 
P&L has been posted to the DPR. In addition to these numbers we booked a 
profit of around o8.8m on the 30th of November relating to the Climate Change 
Levy impact in the UK Power Energy Trends curve.

If you have any queries please let me know.

James
