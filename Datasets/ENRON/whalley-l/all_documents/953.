big guy. So what better way to express your gratitude and love than with a
gift from his favorite team?

MEMORIES
"My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful."
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father

"My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is
football. Anybody who overhears our conversations must think we're nuts. I'm
looking forward to the Texans playing next year, so my dad and I can start
going to a couple of Texans games a year at Reliant."
