 "Structured Derivatives" holds the spread options from the Eastern VPS 
deals.  We hedge with swaps to the power and gas books, leaving all our gamma 
and vega exposure.  The $43mm is a big gamma loss because of the moving power 
curve and a big vega loss because of the moving gas volatility curve.

I am looking to change the loss violation reporting so we report power and 
gas numbers including any movements in the spread option book.  Ted Murphy 
agrees.

   >We had a couple of big shifts on the curves yesterday which I want you to 
be aware of.  We wanted to put several major adjustments through on the same 
day.  The main moves are as follows:
   >
   >Increased gas volatility - we moved the curve up significantly for the 
first several years. Lose o16mm
   >Power Peaks down, off-peaks up across the whole curve.    Gain o10mm

   >Because "structured Derivatives" is a separate line item, this book loses 
$43mm today, with power making approx $40mm to off-set.  The $43mm may need 
to be reported to Skilling, even though the real loss is just the gas loss of 
o16mm.

still expect to hit Q4 targets.).
