Hi Stuart,

Greg is in the London office now.  He's there until end-of-day,  tomorrow, 
June 7.  If you need to reach him, his mobile number is +44 7901516638.  His 
schedule looks good for both the 14th & 15th.  What about 2:30p.m. on the 
14th of June?  Please advise.

Take Care,

Liz

Greg:

I will be in Houston next Wed/Thu 13-14 Jun.  Any chance we could get 
together to discuss life, Enron, and associated concepts?  Let me know what 
times would suit.

Many thanks,

Stu
