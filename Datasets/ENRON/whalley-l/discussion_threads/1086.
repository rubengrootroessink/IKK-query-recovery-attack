Mostly a legislative update today. The extraordinary session is about to 
close without 
passing the windfall profits bills.  Note that the legislative leadership is 
trying to 
rollover pending legislation such as SB1X/AB128X to the new extraordinary 
session.

I will be out of the office for the next week, so California reports will be 
sent to you by Kristin Walsh, x39510.

- There is some procedural dispute over who closes the extraordinary
session - the legislature or the governor.  Sources believe that the
governor actually closes the session and that he likely will do so after he
signs SB 31X at noon.

- Sources do not believe that the excess windfall profits tax
bills (SB 1X/AB 128X) are close enough to be passed by a vote before the
governor signs SB 31X.

- SB 28X, a power plant siting bill, has just passed the Assembly 74-0 and
is headed to the Senate.  The unemployment compensation provision, a source
of controversy, has been taken out.

- The Senate reportedly is only hearing regular session bills at this time.
As of 10:45 a.m. PDT, no extraordinary session bills were scheduled to be
heard on the Senate floor.  However, sources indicate that the Senate may
waive some rules to move bills to the floor faster.

- Once the extraordinary session is closed, a new extraordinary session is
expected to be opened immediately.  However, sources report that no one is
certain if the bills from this session will have the same numbers in the
next session.  The legislature reportedly is trying to arrange so that the
bills will not have to be heard again in committee.
