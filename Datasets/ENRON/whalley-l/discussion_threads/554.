The votes have been counted.  We won.  Thank you for your support.  The 2000 
election should be over.  But because the Democrats are trying to rewrite the 
rules, the fight continues.  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney urgently need 
your help.  To contribute immediately, see form below.

The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to 
other closely contested states.  We are confident of victory, but we need 
your help.

George W. Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast 
ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of the 
Electoral College.

All the Democrat maneuvering -- in the courts, in the streets, on television 
-- is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing 
the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can 
count thousands of improper ballots.

We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election.  The RNC has sent staff to 
Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and 
Wisconsin as well.  We are fighting a multi-front war, and it is expensive.  
These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted -- and they come at a time when the 
RNC's resources have been depleted by the election.  That's why I'm asking 
for your help again today.

I've included two articles - Charles Krauthammer's November 17 column, and 
excerpts from a Los Angeles Times report -- that describe how the Democrats 
are waging this battle.   I hope you'll take time to read them -- they are 
revealing, and they emphasize how high the stakes are in this contest.

Again, I would ask you to read the articles below - and then do four 
important things for our country:

1) send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your friends and 
neighbors who care about this country and want the truth to come out in 
Florida

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. You can get the addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of 
your elected Congress people and Senators at 
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

3) call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your 
strong views on this issue

4) write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on this important subject


Al Gore lost on November 7.  He is now seeking to reverse the results of the 
election in court.  This is an outrage -- and it is a sad day for our 
country. We will fight this battle with all the available means at our 
disposal.  Please help as generously as you can. See below how to contribute 
online, or send your contribution to:

Republican National Committee
310 First Street S.E.
Washington, D.C.  20003

Thank you.

Sincerely,


Jim Nicholson
Chairman

Not by Hand
By Charles Krauthammer

     There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many 
other states to count ballots. The reason is not only speed and efficiency 
but fairness. Of course machines make mistakes, but the mistakes are 
distributed randomly. There is no premeditation, no search for advantage.
     Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were 
double-punched, under-punched or otherwise spoiled in Florida. But machines 
read such errors with scrupulous impartiality. The same cannot be said of 
hand counting. Hand counting is arbitrary, open to manipulation and abuse.
Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines, not humans. When 
humans try, the results, as we have seen in Palm Beach, range from the 
arbitrary to the bizarre. Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners 
holding up cards to the light, trying to divine the intent of voters. Hence 
the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare 
that "dimpled chads"--a slight indentation in the piece of paper one is 
supposed to punch through, even slighter than the now legendary "pregnant 
chad"--must be counted as a vote.
     Second, a manual recount subjects computer cards, literally, to 
manipulation. Under this method, the presidency of the United States hangs by 
a thread, the thread holding the dangling chad. Any waving, shuffling, 
rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread, dislodge the chad, and 
produce a "vote."
     This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly 
neutral. They are not. The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats: 
The counties now seeking to conduct these recounts--Palm Beach and 
Broward--are controlled by Democrats. The decision regarding the legality of 
every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or 
majority Democratic.
     These counties, moreover, are two of the most heavily Democratic in the 
state. They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon 
Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in 1964--and that was the biggest landslide 
of our time. Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether 
to recount the entire county: Two of the test districts voted 20 to 1 for 
Gore, the third 50 to 1. Brezhnev never did that well.
     In such heavily Democratic districts, there is no way a recount will not 
produce more net votes for Gore. You simply expand or narrow your criteria 
for voter "intent"--and produce whatever number you need to win.
What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida? 
The fairest is a statewide machine count--and recount. Why? Because the 
errors balance out.
     What about a statewide manual recount, an option offered by Gore in his 
televised Nov. 15 gambit? It has two disabling liabilities. First, it vastly 
multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias. Thousands of people in 
thousands of precincts handling millions of cards--cards that can be 
manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease. There just aren't enough 
watchdogs to watch all the partisans.

SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA

Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times:

"To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with 
tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line 
and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to 
outdo their opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue... 
"Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of  AFL-CIO 
staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco and elsewhere had  disembarked to learn how to observe the 
ballot count.  "'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new 
charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.'  The volunteers  nodded. 'It's 
very, very important that if you see any kind of mark--a scratch, a dent, a 
pinprick in Al Gore's column--that you challenge.'   When someone then asked 
what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer 
said: 'Keep your lips sealed.'  It was hardball that the Bostonians and other 
importe!
d pros understood well."
