I regret to announce that David Gallagher has decided to leave Enron.  David 
has led our Continental Gas group for the last 2 years, and has built for us 
a market leading franchise and the best team in the industry.  David is a 
highly respected individual both within the company and outside the company, 
and we will miss his professional attitude and great character.

He leaves a very strong team behind him.  Didier Magne and Carsten Sterz have 
built this business with David from day one, and they will continue to own 
their respective books: France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Spain for 
Didier, and all the German-speaking countries plus Eastern Europe for 
Carsten.  Dave Furner will continue to trade the Zeebrugge hub.  Nicola Craig 
will continue to run the Continental option books.  Rudy Dautel, director, 
will join the group as Head Trader, and Didier, Carsten and Nicola will 
report to him.  Dave Furner will report to Didier Magne.  Rudy has a wealth 
of trading experience in US nat gas, crude oil, UK nat gas, and most recently 
Spanish power and LNG.  Rudy will report to me.
Steve Asplin, director, will head up large scale origination for Continental 
gas, as distinct from the trading / mid-marketing functions of Didier and 
Carsten.  Steve will report to me.
Cathy Christmas will continue with her key role as Head of Operations for the 
group, reporting to David Hutchinson.
 All other reporting lines will remain the same.

Please join me in wishing David well for the future, and congratulating Rudy, 
Steve, Carsten and Didier on their new and expanded roles.
