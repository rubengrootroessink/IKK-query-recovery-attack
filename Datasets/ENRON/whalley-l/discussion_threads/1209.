Liz and Greg,
 Now that I've healed from the experience, I wanted to thank both of you for 
your generous donations put towards the sponsorship of my MS-150 
Houston-Austin bicycle ride.  It was much appreciated, and the money all goes 
to a good and worthy cause.  (Contrary to my initial gut impulse, the money 
did not go to the "Scott Tholan New Bike Fund").  
 Seriously though, thanks for your support.  I recently sent in your checks, 
and they should be deposited by the MS organization in the next several days. 

--Scott
