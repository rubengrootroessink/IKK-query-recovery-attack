The following is a list of deals and/or issues that affect industrial
verticals (obviously you have more on your plate when you take into account
EOL, coal, other investments, etc...)

Pulp & Paper - Get a JV set up with industry partners to grow ENA book,
create value and change industry.  Initially Enron driven deal.  IPO if
necessary.

Steel - Investment in e-Steel plus attempt to build a steel book.  IPO or
not will be driven by current owners.

Phelps Dodge/Alcoa - See description on Pulp & Paper

PetChems/Plastics/NGLs - Leverage ChemConnect or build on our own like Pulp
& Paper and/or PD/Alcoa

MG Metals

Meetings - ChemConnect  CEO meeting as well as meeting with Internet
Capital Group MD (attended by Whalley?)
