From: Don Evans, Chairman, Bush-Cheney Campaign

This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George W. Bush and 
Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation in Florida.

It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount effort in Florida.  
Governor Bush won the vote on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a 
recount.  Now, the other side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is 
a reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

The expense of the recount effort must be funded immediately.  Please send a 
check in any amount that you can up to $5000 today.  These contributions, in  
keeping with Governor Bush's "full disclosure" policy on financial 
contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.  Any funds not 
spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

Remember:
1.  Checks must be personal, not corporate.
2.  Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
3.  Mail or overnight check to:

Donald L. Evans
301 Congress Avenue
2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
Austin, Texas 78701

4.  These funds do not count against your annual personal federal giving 
limit of $25,000.

Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have friends that can 
help, please forward this message to them immediately.  We thank you for all 
that you did to help elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank 
you in advance for your willingness to help us during this important time in 
the life of our country.
