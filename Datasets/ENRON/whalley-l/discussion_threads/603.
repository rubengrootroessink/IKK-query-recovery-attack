NYMEX sees private placement before IPO.

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange, which this 
month converted to a for-profit company, is aiming to sell shares to the 
public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors, 
NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday.  But no part of the world's 
largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the 
launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform, now targeted for 
early May, Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview.  "I'd say three 
to nine months (after the private placement) depending on market conditions 
and eNYMEX traction," Rappaport said, referring to the initial public 
offering (IPO). NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself 
and modernize for the 21st century.  The reorganizing London Metal Exchange 
(LME) voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading 
while the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) went wholly 
to electronic trading on Monday, waving goodbye to the shouts and hand 
signals of traditional open outcry trade.  NYMEX demutualized 10 days ago, 
changing its not-for-profit membership structure into that of a 
profit-seeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange 
Inc.  No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from 
the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil, natural gas, 
electricity, heating oil and gasoline on the floor. Rappaport said that 
NYMEX's investment bankers advised a private placement first, in part because 
of recent stock market jitters, and to capitalize on the 128-year-old 
exchange's unique story and build credibility for a market offering. The 
NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately. 
But plenty of potential investors have queued up. Among others, NYMEX has 
open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange, an Internet-based 
trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was 
launched earlier this year, deciding then on the solo route. "The deal that 
was offered was then, and still today looking back on it, was unacceptable," 
he said. "That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental 
Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today. "We would very 
much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange. And I will 
tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest." 
Intercontinental Exchange this summer started over-the-counter trade in gold 
and silver and plans to open up Web-based dealing in energy products in the 
fourth quarter. Backing it are some of the world's top oil companies and 
banks, including BP Amoco Plc. , Royal Dutch/Shell Group Goldman Sachs and 
Deutsche Bank AG . Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for 
listing shares was a "double edged sword" for NYMEX. "The fact that dot-coms, 
and e-commerce in general, don't have the momentum that they had six months 
ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has e-commerce as a 
material part of its valuation," he said. But he said no competitor was 
better positioned than NYMEX. NYMEX has linked up with Platts, a division of 
publishers McGraw-Hill, for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software 
applications company Kiodex Inc. to provide a trade engine for the order 
matching system. But these have no equity stakes. Rappaport said any desire 
to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass 
was balanced against NYMEX's condition that it maintain market neutrality. 
"We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of 
companies," he said. "Having market neutrality will be critical to any 
platform's long-term success." Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX, which was 
first to start in the third quarter this year, was not now placing it at a 
disadvantage against up-and-running over-the-counter platforms like 
Intercontinental, which could yet be its main worry. "If Intercontinental 
launches and clears futures than we're talking about a whole different 
competitive landscape," he said. "The fact that Intercontinental has put 
together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view 
them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that 
road." NYMEX will begin e-trade with energy futures, leaving to a later date 
gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper and aluminum in part because it has 
yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEX's COMEX metals division over 
the right to trade those electronically during New York hours. "We believe we 
can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX member's 
interests and to the exchange's interests," he said. "But to the extent that 
we can't, I don't view that has having any significant impact on either the 
private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue." For now, Rappaport does 
not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaur-like behind LIFFE traders 
out the door. "The challenge for the U.S. exchanges, those that have a 
history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a 
way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces. "I see it 
almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in 
the liquidity chain, for certain products. We've already gone wholly 
electronic in electricity."
