PentaSafe testing new security software

HOUSTON, Dec. 7 (LocalBusiness.com) -- PentaSafe Security Technologies Inc., 
which develops Internet security products, said testing begins this month for 
its newest software, which provides security for Web servers used in 
e-commerce. 
The Houston-based company's new software, VigilEnt Security Agent, is 
designed to protect information in the server from intrusion, loss and damage 
from both internal saboteurs and external hackers. It is expected to be 
available to the general market in the first quarter of 2001. 
The new product extends the company's current offerings, which protect 
operating systems, applications and databases. 
Steve Latham, vice president of strategic planning and development for 
PentaSafe, said the new software provides more than 100 system checks as 
online businesses prepare to move into production mode. It makes 
recommendations on how to secure identified risks and "lock-down" the secured 
system. Once the system is in operation, it continues to monitor and detect 
incidents. 
"It is important especially for companies that are in a hurry to test before 
they go into production," he said. "A lot of times they rush through to get 
things ready and make some mistakes in their application servers so that they 
are not secure." 
"It looks at 'is your system set up right?' and 'who has access?' as to who 
can make changes," Latham said. 
PentaSafe's new software locks down and secures the server, just as a 
homeowner secures the window and doors of his home "before the storm comes," 
he said. 
The new software is designed to work with BEA Systems Inc.'s (Nasdaq: BEAS) 
WebLogic Server 6.0, the latest release of BEA's Java application server. 
PentaSafe could potentially work with other vendors as well, Latham said.
