The Raptor I credit capacity is at $94 million.  The credit capacity will be 
impacted by fourth quarter revaluations on Catalytica, Heartland Steel and 
other assets.  If the credit capacity is exceeded, Enron will need to reserve 
for the loss and any future losses.

The TNPC stock closed at $9.38 on November 20.  The closing price on November 
21 is $8.94 which results Raptor III exceeding its credit capacity by $12 
million.
