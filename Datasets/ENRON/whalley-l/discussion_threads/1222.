...thought everyone would be excited about Meg's last comment below!  When I 
have e-versions of the finals of both cases, I will forward to everyone.  
Thanks to all for your participation in this effort!!

Louise--I have the sign-off card and will get it to you for signature.

Thanks!

-Christie.

Hi Christie,

I hope all is well with you.
Last week I sent you a FedEx with the EnronOnline case in its final version
for your information and was wondering if you received it.
I also enclosed our green release card for Louise Kitchen's
signature.  (Our case records people need  Louise's sign-off on the case
since she's the protagonist.)  I hope you won't mind passing the green card
to Louise for her signature.

As always, thank you so much for your help!
Best,
Meg
PS Everybody loves the Enron cases, and it looks like they will become
bestsellers soon!
