(see attachment for the full story)

Restructuring Today is the oldest and largest business newsletter serving the
(as-yet nameless) new industry created by merging electricity, natural gas, 
telecommunications
and the internet. I've attached a recent story (RToday.pdf) to give you a 
glimpse
at the kind of exclusive and exciting insight our readers benefit from daily.
 If you have any questions or would like to sign-up at the very low price of
$97 for 3 months please don't don't hesitate to contact me.  I can be reached
at 1-800-486-8201.
