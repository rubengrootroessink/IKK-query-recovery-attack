Please mark your calendars for the first annual ENW All-Employee Meeting at
Jillian's on Thursday, July 19th.  Jillian's is located on I-10 West, just
outside the 610 Loop.  This gathering is intended for all ENW
Houston-based, full-time and part-time employees.

The festivities will begin at 3:00 p.m. and we are considering providing
shuttle transportation from and to the Enron Building for those of you
needing transportation.

We look forward to seeing you there and sharing great food, drink, and
fabulous entertainment!  We will provide additional details when they are
finalized.

Philippe and Greg
