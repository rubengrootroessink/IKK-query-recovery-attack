FYI:
Here are the survey results of November's Knead to Know Question of the=20
Month. The question, referring to baking from scratch, using yeast, was:

How often does the average Bread Brigade America member bake?

Almost 71% of respondents bake at least once a month.
Of this group, 86% actually bake several times a month.

Of those respondents who bake less than once a month, some bake only for=20
special occasions and the others only during the holidays.

QUESTION OF THE MONTH
Are Bread Brigade America members baking more this year (2000) than last=20
(1999)? Once again, we have to depend on you in order to arrive at an answe=
r=20
to the question, which we'll publish in an upcoming issue of this newslette=

As we noted in the last Knead to Know newsletter, the purpose of our Questi=
on=20
of the Month is to gather general information which will help us learn how =
we=20
can better meet the needs of Bread Brigade America members. There is no foc=
us=20
on the baking habits of any one individual, nor does your answer represent =
a=20
commitment from you in any way regarding baking.

Please help us by answering the question below.

How would you compare the frequency of your baking from scratch using yeast=
=20
this year (2000) compared to the prior year (1999)?

Next to their great taste, the best thing about Freezer Rolls is their=20
convenience. After you've prepared the dough, you can form it into crescent=

or you can bake them without freezing them at all. The choice is yours.=20
Either way, the result is about two dozen delicious rolls. They're=20
irresistible!
