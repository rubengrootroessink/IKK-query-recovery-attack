The following represents a sampling of my accomplishments for 2000.

1. The creation of the Hawaii 125-0 concept - the creation of a revolver for 
FASB 125 transactions.  The deal will ultimately be fully utilized and has 
saved significant fees for Enron as well as eased execution of those deals 
(single source of equity, etc)

2. The concept of an internet-distributed $3 Bln Revolver - Initiated the 
concept of the distribution of the revolver over the internet which led to 
the launch of Dealbench.

3. The initiation and execution of project Grayhawk - Initiated the idea to 
take a large ENE stock position in January prior to the ENE equity analyst 
conference and led the deal team which executed the trade.  The transaction 
generated $85MM in profits for EGF.  In addition, identified tax leakage in 
the existing structure which was remedied.  Sure it looks like a no-brainer 
now, but it wasn't at the time.

4. Enron NetWorks, Enron Industrial Markets - Regional CFO - Financed MG 
acquisition,  created financing strategy for group and specific transactions.

5. Enron NetWorks Partners, L.P. - Structured and executed private equity 
fund which will raise 
$900MM of outside equity dollars.  Fund will close by year-end.

6. Created structure to monetize existing Pulp & Paper business through FASB 
125 or alternate structure to capture $75MM - $100MM in earnings and 
approximately $200MM in funds flow.
