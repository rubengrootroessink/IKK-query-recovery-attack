Joannie,

Per our conversation, I believe the intent of the visit today by Tom Boren
and Lyn Maddox is to brief Mr. Skilling (and others he would like to have
present) about the National Energy Group by telling them about our corporate
structure, financial structure, ratings, ring fencing and answer any
questions they might have regarding our overall crediworthiness.

Thank you,
Rose
