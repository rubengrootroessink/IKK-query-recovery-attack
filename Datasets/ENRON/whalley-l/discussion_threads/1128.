 Hi Greg --

 The auction will take place tomorrow using WRH's OpenBook system.
This is a significant
 milestone for WR Hambrecht. We will be working with Goldman Sachs
going forward, and I thought
 it would be great if we could set up a meeting with Andrew Fastow
and Ben Glisan in the near future
 to tell the OpenBook story. Please let me know if you would be the
person to make the request
 on our behalf or if it is appropriate for me to call them directly.

 Hope things are great with you.


      Leslie Mueller
      Head, Marketing

 p.s. If you or Liz could be in touch re setting up a meeting, I'd
really appreciate it. We have plans
     to be in Texas a couple of times in June and we would like to
try to add Enron to the top of the list.
