Thank you for agreeing to speak at the ENA/EGM/EIM employee holiday party at 
Enron Field this Saturday.  Attached are some suggested talking points to 
help you with the preparation of your speech.  The maximum time that we have 
allotted for your presentation is 5 minutes.   I am making final revisions to 
the production timeline and will forward that to you shortly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
THANKS!
