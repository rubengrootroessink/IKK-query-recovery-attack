Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The lender meetings in Singapore this week have been challenging.  The Indian 
banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a project with a 
repudiated PPA.  It is becoming more apparent to us that the Indian banks are 
being heavily influenced by the Government of India and not acting as 
commercial institutions.  Our business people do not believe that all or most 
foreign banks will continue funding at this point.  It is likely that the 
Indian banks could act on their own to cure the construction contract 
payments which give rise to termination this month (about $34 million).  
Within a few months, however, the Indian bank facility would be fully funded.

Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging MERC's 
jurisdiction.  While we have a hearing date scheduled on Monday, there is 
some doubt whether or not we will get a hearing on that date.
