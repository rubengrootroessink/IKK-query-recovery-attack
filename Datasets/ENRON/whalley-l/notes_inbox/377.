Dorothy,

Per our discussion, Ken and Kevin would like Greg Whaley and Cliff Baxter to 
interview a candidate for a VP, Network Engineering and Operations in EBS.  
His name is Doug Kelly and he is tentatively scheduled to see Ken and Kevin 
on Monday, November 20.  Mr. Kelly has already interviewed with Kevin and 
several of EBS management.  He is our top candidate for this role and we are 
trying to move quickly.

I appreciate you sending a note to both Greg and Cliff's assistants regarding 
their availability to interview Mr. Kelly.

They can contact Gloria Alvarez at 58059 to coordinate.  

Thanks
