HELP STOP DEMOCRAT ELECTOR TAMPERING!

Al Gore is attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by any means 
necessary.  That includes tampering with the Electoral College itself.

Democrat operatives have begun clandestine background checks on Republican 
electors already certified from the 29 states George W. Bush won on November 
7.  They are looking for ways to persuade -- or intimidate -- Republican 
electors into changing their votes.

With Florida's 25 electoral votes, George W. Bush has a total of 271 
electoral votes.  (270 are needed to win.)  That means a shift of three would 
give Al Gore a majority -- and there are people in Gore's camp who seem to 
think private investigators can sway enough votes to win.

This is outrageous.  Already Al Gore has flooded Florida with lawyers, 
attempting to win in court what he lost at the ballot box.  He is pushing for 
partisan, rigged recounts in Democrat controlled counties.   He is demanding 
that Florida's election laws be junked so Democrat judges can impose a brand 
new, ad hoc system to accommodate the Democrats' frantic legal maneuvers.

Now the Gore camp is tampering with Electors.  Al Gore will do anything to 
win.  I've attached a Wall Street Journal report on the Democrats undercover 
assault on Republican electors.  Read it and draw your own conclusions.

This election should be OVER.  Because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, 
the fight continues.  The RNC is working to defend the integrity of the vote, 
not only in Florida but also in other close states like Oregon, Wisconsin  
and New Mexico as well.  We will fight this to the end, and we are confident 
we will prevail.  But we need your help.

We realize that we have asked a great deal from you in the past few days, but 
the future of our country may well be at stake.  We need to squelch this 
effort to steal Republican votes in the Electoral College in its infancy.

The Democrat Electoral College tampering is being led by Bob Beckel, who you 
may remember as Walter Mondale's campaign manager in 1984.  Below is Mr. 
Beckel's contact information.  Please contact him and express your outrage at 
his low handed tactics.

In addition, please do the following five things to help. Your efforts could 
help make the difference:

1) If you haven't done so already, take a minute to make a contribution to 
the RNC to help defend the integrity of the electoral process -- a process 
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won fairly on November 7 and which must not be 
overturned by Democrat dirty tricks now

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. Let them know that this recent ploy by the Gore campaign is an 
outrageous attempt to undercut our Constitutional Democracy (you can get the 
addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people 
and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/ )

3) Call your local talk radio show or TV news show and raise these issues.

4) Write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on these subjects.

5) Finally, send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your 
friends and neighbors who are interested in knowing the truth about what is 
going on in Florida.

contribution you can afford to the RNC today:

The situation we face is unprecedented.  The presidency and the course of our

extremely important.  Please help as generously as you can.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Gore Resolves to Stay on the Offensive
As Democratic Aides Rally to His Cause
By GLENN R. SIMPSON, TOM HAMBURGER and LAURIE COHEN
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
(Beginning of article omited).
......One battle-tested Democratic consultant has even begun a quiet 
intelligence-gathering operation that could aid a last-ditch Gore strategy in 
the Electoral College. Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984 
Democratic presidential campaign and has close ties to Mr. Christopher, has 
been checking into the background of Republican electors, with an eye toward 
persuading a handful of them to vote for Mr. Gore. If Mr. Bush eventually 
prevails in Florida but wins none other of the most closely contested states, 
he would have 271 electoral votes. Three GOP defections could make Mr. Gore 
president.
"It is information gathering on my part, using my own network," Mr. Beckel 
said, confirming an operation he set in motion days after the Nov. 7 
election. "I call on mostly Democrats, but some Republicans, too, and ask. 
'Who are these electors, and what do you know about them?' I just wanted to 
know who these electors are."
Mr. Beckel, who owns a political-analysis business based in Arlington, Va., 
said he is working independently, "on an ad-hoc basis," and hasn't yet 
contacted any electors directly. "I wouldn't do that without first informing 
the Gore campaign," he said.
