GE Global Plans Railroad Exchange Site
The Washington Post 

Can online commerce help rail companies save money on locomotives and boxcars?

Gaithersburg-based GE Global eXchange Services will announce today the Global 
Rail Exchange, which aims to facilitate just such purchases.
The Internet-based business-to-business exchange, which has been in testing 
for three months with some of the largest buyers and sellers of railroad 
equipment, officially opens for business today with the goal of serving as 
the online marketplace for trade of all the goods used by railroads.

By bringing diffuse manufacturers and buyers together into one exchange, the 
company hopes to offer an attractive proposition to each side, said Otto 
Kumbar, the vice president of interchange solutions at GE Global eXchange 
Services.

Suppliers have joined to get access to more potential buyers, while buyers 
have joined to pit suppliers against one another in pursuit of the lowest 
possible price for components of railroad systems.

Global Rail Exchange, despite starting well after the crest of the wave in 
business-to-business start-ups, claims several advantages. It is run by a 
wholly owned division of General Electric Co., giving it clout in the 
marketplace, and already has 700 companies as users, including some of the 
biggest names in the railroad industry such as Amtrak, Norfolk Southern Corp. 
and CSX Corp.

The company aims to bring liquidity to the market for rail industry supplies, 
and to cut transaction costs by conducting them online and profit through 
subscription fees, as well as collecting a transaction fee for each completed 
sale.

Kumbar claims that in the initial tests with customers, suppliers saved an 
average of 10 to 25 percent on costs normally associated with selling their 
goods.
Many online exchanges have had trouble gaining a foothold this year, as 
innumerable start-ups have set up--often in the same market--and many have 
yet to complete their first transaction or are struggling to generate profits.
"I think the key to our exchange is making sure you have a return on 
investment for all buyers and suppliers," Kumbar said. "We have that."
