Greg,
     It was great to meet you in Houston.  Beth Gordon and I appreciated
the time you gave us and found the discussion really worthwhile.
Obviously, I hope you two can work out some cooperation.   Hope to see
again either in DC or Houston; at IFC, we certainly will pursue you guys on
the weather side.
All the best for the holidays.
Nina
