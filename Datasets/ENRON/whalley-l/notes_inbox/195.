o Report: Crosspoint Forgoes $1 Billion New Fund

NEW YORK -- Crosspoint Venture Partners has commitments
for a new $1 billion fund but has decided not to
raise the capital, according to a report in the

the difficult environment for investing in new companies
and generating high returns. Crosspoint will raise
the fund as soon as the environment improves, according
to the report. Crosspoint raised an $850 million
fund earlier this year.

EnergyWorkspace in alliance with VerticalNet
HOUSTON, Nov. 29 (LocalBusiness.com) -- EnergyWorkspace, a developer of 
online business software for the oil and gas industry, has formed an alliance 
with a huge Pennsylvania business-to-business company to co-brand their 
products. 
EnergyWorkspace said the deal with VerticalNet Markets, a unit of VerticalNet 
Inc. (Nasdaq: VERT), of Horsham, Pa., will give its users greater information 
reach through that company's two energy portals. 
VerticalNet operates 55 industry-specific online communities, including one 
for oil and gas interests and another for the hydrocarbon industry. 
Mark Beatty, president and chief executive officer of Houston-based 
EnergyWorkspace, said in a release the alliance will aid his customers and it 
also will "introduce our unique business process support system to thousands 
of potential clients across a range of energy companies." 
Both companies commented on how well the two fit each other's needs, stopping 
just short of mentioning a possible merger. Jerry Alwais, a spokesman for 
EnergyWorkspace, told LocalBusiness.com that he does not know terms of the 
deal and has not heard anything about a merger. Officials at each company 
were not available for futher comment. 
The once high-flying VerticalNet, whose stock traded as high as $148.38 last 
spring, opened today at a 52-week low of $10.50. 
Joseph Galli, chief executive officer and president of VerticalNet, earlier 
said his company was looking to make strategic acquisitions. He made the 
announcement at the same time the company said it lost a whopping $121.9 
million through the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 
$38.2 million for the period a year earlier. 
Since EnergyWorkspace is privately held, it doesn't report on its financial 
picture.
