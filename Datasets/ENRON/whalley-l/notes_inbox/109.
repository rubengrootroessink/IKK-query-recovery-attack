Hey Greg -- call when you get a chance -- it's a wild time, and you need to
keep things together!! Keep up your good work.  Meeting Longitude folks can
wait.  Have a great holiday season. Wendy

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.
As I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to
contact him next week.

Greg
