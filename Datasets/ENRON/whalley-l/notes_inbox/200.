To all:

We continue to make progress on the EPP (electronic payment platform)
and are we are actually testing some modules internally.  The market
continues to migrate toward our space, which hopefully means there will be a
greater
understanding of what our system can do.  The existing 1.2 trillion dollar
market is possibly bigger than we thought.  We are having conversations with
several Fortune 500 companies who do non-cash trading in an effort to
ascertain the size of each of their current markets.

We are heavily involved in our current raise of 5 MM.  While we
are in discussions with a few organizations, we would be interested in
speaking with anyone who has an interest in a large market, experienced
management
team, closed loop settlement platform, and a company with "HIDDEN VALUE".
So if you are aware of either angels with $100,000 or more to invest or
seed or start-up VC's who can bring $5 Million to the table, let us know.

In today's market it is often difficult to determine true value in a
corporation, much less the hidden value.  This "hidden" value is often
called "IP" or Intellectual Property.  On that front, the good news for us
is; We own our Intellectual Property!  Why is this important you may ask?

Well, a business associate of mine at a company called Neo Media (NEOM) just
recently signed a 100 MILLION DOLLAR PLUS licensing agreement for their
suite of patents.  This is extremely encouraging as the market NEOM is in is
dwarfed in comparison to the global trade market where our IP is based.  We
have been very diligent in filing the IP documents and the attorney's have
issued a letter of opinion stating the validity and defensibility of our
claims.

This should prove extremely valuable as we move forward in building the
company.  As other competitors attempt to move into our space, they will
bump up against <the> our patents.  This will pose tremendous licensing
opportunities for GBUCs and 2Xchange. A very interesting point within the
NEOM agreement is the "NON-EXCLUSIVE" nature of the license.
Congratulations to all at NEOM, and thank you for paving the way for
corporations like ours.
