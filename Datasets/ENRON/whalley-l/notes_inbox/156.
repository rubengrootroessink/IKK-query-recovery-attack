WoodFuel.com allies with Future Energy 
HOUSTON, Dec. 6 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Houston-based WoodFuel.com has teamed 
up with Atlanta's Future Energy Resources Corp. to supply raw wood materials 
that are targeted to fire up environmentally friendly power plants in Texas. 
The power-generating stations would use Future Energy's SilvaGas process, 
which converts agricultural, municipal and forestry wastes into a 
clean-burning gas that substitutes for natural gas. 
The process is designed to significantly reduce environmental impact compared 
to fossil fuel-based power plants, including the elimination of net carbon 
dioxide emissions, the company said. 
"Texas regulations and energy demands make Texas an ideal location for green 
energy," said Asfaha Tesfai, senior VP of business development for Future 
Energy. "This alliance will ensure sufficient fuel availability to proceed 
with project development." 
In August, Future Energy operated its SilvaGas process on a commercial scale 
at a demonstration plant in Burlington, Vt., which converted more than 285 
tons of wood chips into enough of natural gas substitute to power 6,000 
homes. 
The private company designed and built the plant in partnership with the U.S. 
Department of Energy, which provided technical assistance and funding for 
facility construction, and the Burlington Electric Department. 
Future Energy now is working to develop relationships, such as its alliance 
with WoodFuel.com, that would help it commercialize the process. 
Privately held WoodFuel.com is a business-to-business, e-commerce company 
that links buyers and suppliers of raw wood material online. The company 
aggregates wood fuel from its network of suppliers and delivers the wood as a 
renewable energy resource. 
Since its April launch, WoodFuel.com said it has created a total of 283 new 
accounts and sold 15,845 tons of wood fuel.

Clearinghouse puts pieces in place for 2001

12/05/2000 
Gas Daily 

Over-the-counter (OTC) energy clearinghouse EnergyClear moved one step closer 
to its planned 2001 launch, choosing onExchange's technology platform for 
EnergyClear's online trading system.

OnExchange, which works with electronic exchanges to add risk-management 
capabilities for their customers, said EnergyClear initially will offer its 
services to traders in the wholesale gas and power markets. As early as next 
spring - once the system comes online - it will provide centralized 
comparison, netting and settlement of OTC energy contracts for trades 
executed over the phone or through electronic marketplaces, onExchange says.

EnergyClear Co-founder and President Lee Burton said the implementation of 
onExchange technology satisfies a long-standing need in the OTC markets, 
while providing other benefits as well. "The OTC markets have been seeking 
the efficiencies of multilateral clearing for some time now and, in 
conjunction with . . . onExchange, EnergyClear offers the first neutral, 
independent, unbiased clearing solution," Burton said.

OTC energy contracts currently are negotiated between principals, via 
electronic exchanges or through interdealer brokers over the telephone. 
Future markets planned for the clearinghouse include petroleum products, 
crude oil, petrochemicals and bandwidth.

With the deal, EnergyClear becomes onExchange's first customer. Terms of the 
deal were not disclosed.

IDC analyst Aaron McPherson suggested a bright future for EnergyClear. 
"Online forwards and derivatives trading and clearing solutions typically 
deliver a five- to 10-fold increase in trading volume over underlying cash 
markets. These solutions will improve the overall efficiency of the energy 
market, allow energy companies to manage their risk much more effectively and 
increase liquidity."

Houston-based EnergyClear is comprised of EnergyClear Corp. and EnergyClear 
Operations Co. (EOC). EOC is owned by the Bank of New York, Prebon Yamane and 
Amerex. CH
