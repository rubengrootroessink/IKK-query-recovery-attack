Dear Mr. Vice Chairman,

As a new Executive Committee member I am writing to inquire as to any 
additional compensation that I may be due in light of my increased level of 
responsibility.  Does this change the company's position regarding my 
previous e-mail related to the vesting of my restricted stock?

Regards,

Jim
