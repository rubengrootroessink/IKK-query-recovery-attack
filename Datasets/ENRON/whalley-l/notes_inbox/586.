Dear Greg:
I met you briefly about six weeks ago in Cliff's office - I was leaving as
you were coming in.

I am an executive recruiter with Management and Capital Partners. I have
done a great deal of work in the energy industry - I will send you some
information on me and my company via FedEx .

I will be in Houston May 30 - June 1 and would love the opportunity to sit
down with you for a few  minutes. I will call your office later in the week
to set up an appointment.

Cheers,
Barbara
