in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but 
rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals 
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with 
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work 
that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron 
deal.
