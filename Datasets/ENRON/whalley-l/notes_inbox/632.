On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian 
headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore 
possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company in 
Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston 
representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed 
by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other 
opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this 
week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston 
representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US 
acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas 
markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron and 
Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with 
Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or 
its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this 
unfamiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your 
review.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special 
thanks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel 
that should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please 
circulate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or 
could benefit from the materials.
