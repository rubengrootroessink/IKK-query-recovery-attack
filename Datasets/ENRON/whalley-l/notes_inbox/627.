Given the current economic climate, BusinessWeek will gather leading economic 
editors and advisors to give a special briefing at our upcoming Breakthrough 
executive event, taking place June 27-29, 2001 at the Rancho Bernardo Inn, 
San Diego, California.

For more information about Breakthrough go to

Entitled "The New Economy Downturn," this briefing will feature a keynote 
address from BusinessWeek Economics Editor and author of the best-seller, 
"The Coming Internet Depression," Michael Mandel. Mandel will also lead an 
exclusive, closed-door roundtable discussion among BusinessWeek's top editors:

-  BusinessWeek Washington Editor Lee Walczak will tell us why Washington 
hasn't panicked over the downturn and offer a prediction of future action by 
the Fed, the Hill, and the White House

-  Senior L.A. Correspondent Chris Palmeri will assess the impact on the 
California economy and its energy crisis in the context of the downturn.

-  BusinessWeek Online's "Street Wise" columnist Margaret Popper will share 
her insights on how the Street may respond in these uncertain times.

Together, these editors (and others to be confirmed) will offer Breakthrough 
delegates access to the best economic intelligence available and facilitate a 
candid dialogue on the most pressing issues on every chief executive's mind.

The economic briefing is only one of the diverse topics being examined at the 
conference. BusinessWeek's goal in convening Breakthrough is to create a 
setting where there can be meaningful discussion on the fundamental changes 
that are occurring in the business environment. Through intense interaction 
among delegates, we hope to facilitate a meaningful discourse on the trends, 
theories and technologies that underlie today's key corporate issues.

Facilitated by an elite faculty of thought leaders, the discourse will be 
structured around these five issues:

-  The Changing Rules of Leadership and The Evolving Qualities of Leaders
-  Continuous Supply-Chain Funding and Precision Demand Forecasting
-  Globalization, Technology, and the "Trusted Identity"
-  Pervasive Computing and the Proliferation of Wireless Technologies
-  Customer Ascendancy

The retreat's co-founder and provocateur, Jim Taylor, has been named one of 
America's leading business futurists by the Wall Street Journal. The former 
head of global marketing for Gateway, he has served as a consultant and 
strategist to firms at the forefront of the New Economy, and has written and 
spoken extensively on the sweeping changes technology has wrought on our 
corporate, political, and cultural systems. His books, The 500 Year Delta and 
The Visionary's Handbook, co-written with Watts Wacker, are widely regarded 
as indispensable reads for forward-thinking executives.

Joining Jim, the retreat's esteemed faculty will include:

-  Deepak Chopra, M.D., Founder, The Chopra Center for Well Being
-  Dr. Ronald Heifetz, Co-director, The Center for Public Leadership, John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University
-  Sandy Kemper, Founder and CEO, eScout
-  Suzanne D. Lyons, Chief Marketing Officer, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
-  Michel Mayer, General Manager, Pervasive Computing Group, IBM Corporation
-  Jonathan Nelson, Co-founder, CEO, and Chairman, the Organic Institute
-  Will Rodgers, Principal, SHR Perceptual Management
-  Geoffrey S. L.  Shaw, President, CEO, Chairman and Co-founder, Global 
Commerce Systems
-  Guy S. Tallent, President and CEO of Identrus
-  J. Craig Venter, Ph.D.. President and Chief Scientific Officer, Celera 
Genomics Corporation
-  Stephen G. Vetter, President, Eureka Communities

In a unique teamwork exercise, four-time America's Cup Champion Dennis Conner 
and members of his "Stars and Stripes" crew will lead Breakthrough delegates 
on a sailing regatta in San Diego Harbor. Ten boats manned by Breakthrough 
executives will engage in an Olympic style sailboat race in the San Diego 
Harbor. The boats will serve as tools in this exercise designed to explore 
the new realities of leadership, competition, and teamwork in the new 
economy. The race is serious but the lesson (and the fun) will be invaluable.

Interested parties are encouraged to apply asap as capacity is limited to 100 
executives and few spaces remain. For complete details on Breakthrough's 
agenda and speakers, please visit
