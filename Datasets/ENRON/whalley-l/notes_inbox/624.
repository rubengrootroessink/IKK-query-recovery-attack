Greg,

With the recent changes in the E&C organization, I am interested in exploring 
other opportunities within the Wholesale group.  I would greatly appreciate 
the opportunity to introduce myself to you and to get any suggestions you 
might have in this regard.

Attached, for your information, is a copy of my resume.  If you have a few 
moments this week, please let me know.

Thank you,

Peter
