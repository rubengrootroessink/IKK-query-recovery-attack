Weekly Update=20
Dec. 1, 2000=20

The Texans made national headlines this week when University of Miami head=
=20
coach Butch Davis arrived in Houston Tuesday. Davis visited with Texans Own=
er=20
Bob McNair and Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly=20
before flying back to Miami. McNair then addressed the media at the Hyatt=
=20
Regency Houston.

"We will be visiting with a number of people, some of whom will not be a=20
candidate and others who perhaps will be a candidate," McNair said. "Butch =
is=20
a very highly qualified coach. He has done an outstanding job at the=20
University of Miami. He has all the credentials in my view. He is certainly=
=20
well qualified to hold the position.

"But we are just now getting started in this process and the visit we had=
=20
today was really just to get to know each other."

Davis, in his sixth season at UM, led the Hurricanes to a 10-1 record and t=
he=20
Big East title this season. Miami is currently ranked second in both the=20
Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls. Davis owns a 50-20 record at UM=
=20
and is 3-0 in bowl games. The Hurricanes have already clinched a spot in th=
is=20
season=01,s Bowl Championship Series. If Kansas State upsets top-ranked Okl=
ahoma=20
Saturday, Miami would face Florida State in a 1-2 Orange Bowl bout. If the=
=20
Sooners win, the Hurricanes would play in either the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl.

Before arriving at UM, Davis spent six seasons as an assistant with the=20
Dallas Cowboys, the last two as defensive coordinator.

"I don=01,t know what the future might hold but he=01,s certainly the type =
of=20
person we=01,d like to have in our organization," McNair said.

McNair and Casserly flew to San Antonio Wednesday for a luncheon at The=20
Argyle. Casserly had addressed San Antonio=01,s Touchdown Club earlier this=
=20
fall. Minnesota Vikings Owner Red McCombs, a resident of San Antonio, also=
=20
attended.

"We think it is important that we be viewed as a South Texas team," McNair=
=20
said. "We would love to have the fans in San Antonio feel an affinity for o=
ur=20
team and like the way we play and the way we run the club. Our goal right n=
ow=20
is to reach out to them and let them know we are interested in them and tha=
t=20
we are going to have a first-class, high-quality operation."

Casserly flew to Minneapolis Thursday to scout the Vikings-Lions game at th=
e=20
Metrodome before returning to Houston for scouting meetings Friday morning.

The Texans will hold their first Houston Texans Junior Training Camp Saturd=
ay=20
at Memorial Park. The first session, which runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., is=
