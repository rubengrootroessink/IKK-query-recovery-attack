Citigroup And Oracle Strike Marketplace Deal -- COMPANIES TEAM TO OFFER 
INTEGRATED PAYMENT SERVICES ON BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS EXCHANGES 11/20/2000 

Citigroup is extending its reach as a provider of financial services to 
business-to-business marketplaces. The $82 billion company has struck a deal 
with Oracle to integrate its payment and financial-settlement services into 
the vendor's online marketplace platform, Oracle Exchange.

In addition, Citigroup will co-brand and market OracleExchange.com, Oracle's 
trading exchange for business supplies, to business clients and deploy 
Oracle's E-procurement applications internally to simplify its own purchasing.

Citigroup already offers its services, called CitiConnect, to rival 
marketplace companies i2 Technologies Inc. and Commerce One Inc. CitiConnect 
supports complex financial transactions, such as employee procurement-card 
purchases, electronic funds transfers, and cross-border payments, for 
businesses participating in exchanges, whether or not they're Citibank 
customers.

Other financial companies target-ing this market include Chase Manhattan Bank 
Corp. and First Union Corp., which have partnerships with online marketplace 
software provider Metiom Inc.; Wachovia Corp. has aligned with Clarus Corp.; 
and ABN Amro, Bank of America, and US Bank have payment-services deals with 
Ariba Inc.

"We see the role of banks in this space increasing as more commerce occurs 
online," says Ann Cairns, global E-solutions head at Citigroup's E-business 
unit. "The key thing that we bring in working with technology companies is an 
understanding and intellectual capital around security and privacy issues."

But Cairns says few transactions occur on exchanges today. Most are building 
their marketplaces, she says. It may be a while before integrated payment 
services gain traction. A recent survey by AMR Research revealed that 
companies participating in exchanges are still most interested in product and 
vendor search capabilities, order status and tracking, and integration with 
partners.

RetailExchange .com Inc., a business-to-business exchange for excess consumer 
goods, is working on integrated credit services with commercial finance firm 
CIT Group Inc. It plans to add shipping and payment services eventually, but 
says large companies already have departments with expertise in those areas. 
Says Ken Frieze, president and CEO of RetailExchange.com, "add-on transaction 
services have to be better and have a greater value proposition than what's 
available offline."
