Greg, 

I trust that you are doing well.? In reference to the email below, I will 
plan on calling you this week to discuss.? I have not heard from you, most 
likely due to your hectic schedule, but my enthusiasm remains extremely high.

Best Regards, 
Joe

Greg, 

I do hope you remember me, and that Liz Taylor passed the note on to you 
requesting a meeting with you regarding possible re-employment with Enron, 
but more specifically, employment with Enron Net Works.? I believe that you 
are running the efforts of that group, and I am more than excited to speak 
with you about employment opportunities.

Although you have interviewed me in the past for the crude oil options 
trading position (1996, my first year at Enron), the passage of time 
hopefully allows me to refresh you on my background, in brief.

Pursuant to working at Enron, I currently work at Chematch.com, a leading 
online, real-time B2B Exchange, concentrating in the petrochemical and 
polymer industry, but with reaches into the fuel products arena.? I was one 
of the first dozen employees. We were the first movers of our business type 
in this vertical.? My role here has been on the 1) business development 
efforts, 2) prime member on the venture capital raising process, and 3) prime 
member of the IPO process/due diligence team.? Most recently, I was promoted 
from Vice President to Vice President & Senior Officer, heading the entire 
content portion of our firm (petrochem.net).

Prior to joining Enron, I attended the University of Chicago Graduate School 
of Business and received an MBA with concentrations in Analytic Finance and 
Accounting.? Prior to that, I spent three years on Wall Street with Merrill 
Lynch and Prudential Securities, in in both investment banking and FI capital 
markets.

If you need a couple of quick recommendations from Enron, I would humbly 
suggest Fred Lagrasta, Jeff Shankman, Harold Buchanan, Donald M. Black, Greg 
Woulfe, and others of your choice.

Attached is my resume for your review.? I know the extremely busy schedule 
that you uphold, but would greatly appreciate the chance to meet you once 
again to discuss any opportunity you may see fit for me within your group.

Best Regards,
