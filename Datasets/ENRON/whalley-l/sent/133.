Let's talk! 

Hey Greg! It was terrific seeing you and Mary at the wedding (thought I wish 
I had spent more time talking to Mary). Now that I'm back in the office, I 
thought I'd send you this invitation to talk.  In theory, as long as you are 
using Windows, it should work, though I've had recent reports of some 
problems with Netscape.  When you get a mic and you think I might be on-line 
at work, just click the link below, agree to the certificate, and we should 
be connected. If it doesn't work, I'll have to call you to walk you through a 
demo of our other stuff. Let me know. Take care, Henri P.S.  Ulrich is still 
so *serious*!

P.S.  If you go there and don't find me, I might not be on-line anymore.  In 
any event, you can bookmark my web address to connect later. 

Also - the first time you connect might take a little longer than usual:  you 
might need to wait for your browser to be VoiceCONTACT enabled.
