________________________________________________________


INTERNET CO. CREATES TRAVEL DERIVATIVES.
Internet startup Tulip Holdings has designed what it believes
are the first travel derivatives, and is planning to help launch a
listed market for them. Corporates, ticket distributors and airlines
are expected to use options to hedge price volatility on airline
tickets, hotel rooms, and car rental services.


CREDIT DERIVATIVES PROS SET TO RAKE IT IN.
Bonuses for credit derivatives professionals in London and New
York are expected to be sky high this year following twelve months
of torrid growth. A structurer in London with about six years of
experience can expect a bonus of USD1.5 million on a base of
USD100,000.


ENRONCREDIT.COM COURTS EYEBALLS WITH CASH.
EnronCredit.com, whose main product is a digital bankruptcy
swap, has begun offering USD1,000 in cash to registered members
of the site who refer the most credit risk management professionals
to the site during two-hour windows of time.
