George,

My Assistant, Liz Taylor, is the United Way Coordinator for Enron Net Works.  
Your group is listed with Net Works' United Way campaign.  Our participation 
numbers are very low.  We started yesterday with our telephone and personal 
visit campaign.

Liz has listed below the employees, she believes, belong to your 
organization.  These are the names of those employees who have not gone 
online to make their pledge.  Please have your Assistant verify this list.  
If they are indeed your employees, I'm asking you to personally call them and 
ask them to go online and make their pledge.  If any of the names listed 
below are not with your group, please have your assistant notify Liz.

Should they experience difficulties getting online, please call Liz @ 
31935.   UnitedWay.Enron.com.

Thank you,

Greg Whalley
