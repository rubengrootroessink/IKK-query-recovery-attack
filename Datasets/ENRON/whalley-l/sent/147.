Just for grins.  Joe's home number on Sunday is 281-363-9913 - just in case 
you two get disconnected.  His driver will pickup at Joe's home at 2:30 and 
the driver's car phone number is 713-598-4052 or Joe's portable is 
713-725-5979.

Thanks

Mr. Sutton,

I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
commercial flights both ways.

   Sunday, February 27
   Depart Houston @ 8:00a.m.
   Arrive London @ 11:52p.m. (same day)

Please advise.

Liz Taylor
Assistant to Greg Whalley
