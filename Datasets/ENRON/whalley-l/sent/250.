You're e-mailing me on Greg's address book.  It's because I responded to your 
first address from his e-mail and I thought I was in my address book.

Honey,  please feel better soon.  I'm saying a prayer for you right now.  I'm 
glad I put a smile on your face (and what a handsome face it is).    Liz

 Going
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine." - I don't understand.

I'm having a poor day.  Got to have thick skin in this business.
Hey, thinking of your beautiful "happy" smile makes me smile.  You certainly
deserve someone that brings that special kind of joy to your life.

He asked me to table it til this week.  Last week was full of activities
planning for the Analyst conference and tons of meetings about our problems
in CA (Power).

Sorry you're not feeling well.  Take care of yourself.    I had a lovely
weekend, thank you.  Edmond and I did dinner & dancing on Saturday night.
We had a picnic @ Allen Parkway on yesterday afternoon.  Followed by a
Super Bowl party for two.  This was a lot of fun.  We ate junk food and
drank cokes all night.  By 3:30a.m. this morning we both had a stomach
ache.

Am I sharing enough, to much?  I think I like me old way better.  Going
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine."

Liz

I had a so, so weekend.  I'm tired, half ill, and working for some new
accounts.  Any word yet?

How was your weekend?

I'm sure you and Edmund had a blast - what did you do?
