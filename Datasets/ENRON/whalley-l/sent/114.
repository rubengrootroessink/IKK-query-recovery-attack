Subject: Interviews


Hey Greg,
I enjoyed interviewing with both you and Jim last week
friday. I would like to talk to you some more about
the opportunities available in Enron Networks. Two
areas I thought would be interesting would either be
helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to
enter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks is
in the process of entering.

A couple of things that I thought were interesting
about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most
business plans where the strategy is build the site
and the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volume
to entice other people to participate. What most
e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating
process, but in reality this has very little value
added unless the market is coupled with a
finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary
system for physical goods. We addressed some of these
issues in the ilogex business plan.

I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to
give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.
 I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.

Thanks,
Brad
