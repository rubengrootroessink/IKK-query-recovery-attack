Mr. Piazze,

I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times 
in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:


When in the evening will Greg give his speech?
Who long is he scheduled to speak?
Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises 
to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so.
What is the dress code?


Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
