Mr. Sutton,

I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
commercial flights both ways.

   Sunday, February 27
   Depart Houston @ 8:00a.m.
   Arrive London @ 11:52p.m. (same day)

Please advise.

Liz Taylor
Assistant to Greg Whalley
