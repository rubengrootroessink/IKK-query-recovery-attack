i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks 
and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, 
international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book 
this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that 
bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time 
i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out?
