Hi Iris,

Happy New Years!  I miss corresponding with you.  Take care and write soon.  
If you ever plan a visit to Houston, you have an open invitation at my house.

Dear Greg,

It's good to hear how well you're doing.  As you may know, I left John and 
Joe to become the Office Manager in Madrid and I'm really enjoying it.

I was talking about you and Jay to the guys here the other day and telling 
them what a loss it is for them not to have met you.

You're one of a kind and I'll always remember you!

Hasta luego

Iris
