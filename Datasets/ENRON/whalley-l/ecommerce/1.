HoustonStreet Weaves New Round of Investments And Strategic Partnerships
Into Its `web for the Web'

  PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2000--


  Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient, Bowstreet and others bring financial,
marketing and B2B Internet savvy to Web-based wholesale
  energy exchange


  Taking another step toward becoming the Internet-based energy trading
leader, HoustonStreet Exchange today announced a new round of investments and
strategic relationships with key experts. Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient and
Bowstreet have all joined HoustonStreet's web for the Web, a virtual network
of business and technology companies that support HoustonStreet's delivery of
wholesale energy trading platforms.

  HoustonStreet established the web for the Web business model as a
rapid-development network of strategic partnerships with companies that have
expertise in disparate fields, rather than building its own departments
in-house. Leveraging the core competencies of its key partners, HoustonStreet
is able to execute quickly and effectively in a rapidly changing environment.
After helping HoustonStreet launch its company and its wholesale power trading
exchange, HoustonStreet.com, these businesses are now helping the company
improve the exchange and expand it aggressively into additional markets.

  Thomas H. Lee Company, one of the oldest, largest and most successful
private equity investment firms in the country with more than $6 billion in
total capital under management, will provide HoustonStreet with important
financial advisement and significant contacts to help the company expand.

  "HoustonStreet has a great Internet exchange platform and stands alone in
its ability to give energy traders the information they need within an
easy-to-use, fluid trading environment," said Tom Hagerty, managing director
at Thomas H. Lee Company. "We believe online energy trading will grow
dramatically in the months and years ahead, and HoustonStreet is well
positioned to seize this opportunity."

  In addition to Thomas H. Lee Company, leading technology companies Sapient
and Bowstreet, private equity investment firms Omega Advisors, Inc. and
Elliott Associates, L.P., and principals from MicroArts Corporation
participated in this round of financing. Sapient, Bowstreet and MicroArts all
play integral roles in HoustonStreet's Web-driven business model, and will
continue to help the company respond to market demand in Internet time.
HoustonStreet Exchange relied on Sapient's strategic and systems integration
experience to design and build the site. MicroArts developed the user
interface, interactive marketing Web site, and marketing plan for the site's
launch. Bowstreet is working with HoustonStreet.com to develop the platform
for HoustonStreet to provide additional value-added services to its customers
and to link trading information directly to trading companies' mid- and
back-office systems using XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology. This
will allow risk managers to have a real-time view of trading activity.

  "These relationships demonstrate the strength of our web for the Web," said
HoustonStreet president and CEO Frank Getman. "We pride ourselves on working
with the best and brightest in their particular areas of expertise who share
our commitment to execution and success. Omega, Elliott and Thomas H. Lee
bring financial and Wall Street expertise, while Sapient, Bowstreet and
MicroArts provide us with the technology and marketing savvy that have given
us a leadership position in the market."
