Iain,

First, thank you for being so helpful with me on the phone.  Below is the 
information you requested for the Whalley home fax machine.  I would love to 
meet w/you to discuss an updated fax machine for Greg's at home office.


Greg & Mary Whalley
11110 Claymore Street
Houston, TX  77024

(Memorial/Voss area off Hedwidg)
HM#713-465-1641

The repair person can come any time tomorrow, Wednesday, 8/30.  However, a.m. 
works better for Mary Whalley.  Please give me a call when the rep. is 
scheduled to go out.  

The machine is jamming and eating paper.

HP Office Jet
Model #45W - MAX
50-60HZ
