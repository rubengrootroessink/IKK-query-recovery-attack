He asked me to table it til this week.  Last week was full of activities 
planning for the Analyst conference and tons of meetings about our problems 
in CA (Power).

Sorry you're not feeling well.  Take care of yourself.    I had a lovely 
weekend, thank you.  Edmond and I did dinner & dancing on Saturday night.  We 
had a picnic @ Allen Parkway on yesterday afternoon.  Followed by a  Super 
Bowl party for two.  This was a lot of fun.  We ate junk food and drank cokes 
all night.  By 3:30a.m. this morning we both had a stomach ache.

Am I sharing enough, to much?  I think I like me old way better.  Going 
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine."

Liz

I had a so, so weekend.  I'm tired, half ill, and working for some new
accounts.  Any word yet?

How was your weekend?

I'm sure you and Edmund had a blast - what did you do?
