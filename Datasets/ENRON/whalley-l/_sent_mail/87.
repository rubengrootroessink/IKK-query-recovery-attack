John,
     I had lunch today with David Ownby (plus, Brent Larsen and Michael Chang 
of RedMeteor.com).   David suggested that perhaps there could be some sort of 
arrangement between RedMeteor.com and EOL wherein each could benefit from the 
other's platform.  He was referring specifically to the refined products and 
crude oil areas (where they are primarily physical and we are primarily 
financial).  I am under the impression that there may have been some contact 
earlier this year between Enron management and Vincent Di Cosimo of RedMeteor 
and I had heard the names of Greg Whalley and John Sherriff mentioned in that 
regard.  Is that correct and did anything ever materialize?
     As you know RedMeteor and Vitol are in the process of formalizing a 
strategic alliance to "aid in their positioning in the global marketplace" as 
reported in the media.  And the person involved from Vitol, Mike Loya, is a 
person that I have known for years, but have not discussed this topic with 
him.  Is there anything worth pursuing with RedMeteor?
Regards,
Mike
