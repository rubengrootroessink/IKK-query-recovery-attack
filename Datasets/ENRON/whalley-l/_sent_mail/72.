Hi Greg:
?
I have been fascinated by Enron's move into bandwidth for some  time now.? I 
firmly believe no company is in a better position to  understand the dynamics 
of the market or the importance of providing liquidity,  market-makers and 
transparancy to a market.
?
I am the CEO of a company called Bid4me.com, inc.? We are  an?start up with 
an eye for innovation in the internet solutions  field.? In particular, we 
are looking to bundle huge groups of small and  medium sized businesses 
into?blocks and force vendors to?bid  aggressively for their businesses in 
a?unique two-stage reverse auction  process.
?
We are?currently in stealth mode, however, our business  model so impressed 
Pillsbury Maddison Sutro, LLC (please see http://www.pillsburylaw.com ) that 
they  accepted us as clients on a deferred fee basis.
?
Our vision is to work with Enron to bring greater savings to  SMEs.??We will 
bring hundreds of SMEs' internet access demands at once  to several vendors.? 
Very few of them will be able to accommadate such  demand without appealing 
to companies like Enron for the provision of extra  bandwidth.? We would like 
to not only bring the SMEs to the vendors to bid  on but?to offer the vendors 
a bandwidth discount through exclusively using  Enron's market-place.
?
This way everyone benefits, including Enron.? Enron get's  a huge block 
demand for bandwidth and?its market-makers get the  revenue.??Enron will also 
gain greater credibilty through getting  increased liquidity flow.
?
The vendors, e.g. Adelphia Business Systems, benefit by  receiving a block 
discount through Enron and by receiving revenue from a large  block of SMEs.
?
The SMEs benefit by receiving savings passed on to them from  the Enron 
discount and through using the soon to be patented Bid4me  model.
?

Our website is currently housed on a Stanford University  Server.? ? However, 
very shortly it will be housed on our own  server.? So in the future you will 
be able to reach us at http://www.Bid4me.com

?
If you double-click on the section 'For angel's eyes only' you will find  our 
current business plan and financials.? Our financials were written by  two 
CPAs in London.
?
You might be interested to know that aside from just  developing our alpha 
website we currently have a small team from Stanford  University ( including 
three PhDs) working on developing our alpha  prototype.
?
Brio, Inc have recently agreed to furnish us, for a trial  period, with their 
software licences (Brio explorer and Brio designer).?  The licence fees are 
usually $5,000.
?
Edgar.com have permitted us to have a free trail of their software.
?
We are looking for at least $1.5mm to launch Bid4me.? If  you have any 
interest in funding us or in working with us in the future I would  be very 
interested to hear your feedback. 
?
Last thing: as we are still in the process of applying for a  patent I would 
appreciate your discretion.? Please do not forward this  password-restricted 
website to anyone outside of Enron Corp.
?
Kind regards 
?
Sebastian Elliot
