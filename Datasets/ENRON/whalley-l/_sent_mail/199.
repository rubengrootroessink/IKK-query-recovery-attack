Christie,

Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some 
dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could 
work out fine, it that's not too late.  

Liz

Hey Greg!

Though you're unavailable on March 21st to speak at Stanford, Stanford still 
wants YOU!!!

Will you please check your calendar and  propose some dates you can make it 
there--the class is about 50 Exec eds, CXO levels form high profile 
companies.  It would be an easy presentation--about 1hr 1/2 on "The evolution 
of Enron".

Thanks!

--Christie.

Christie,

If Greg comes to the Bay Area sporadically, we can plan around that.  What I
have in mind now is our E-Commerce Seminar (Wednesdays every two weeks)
which is an open forum for discussing E-Commerce issues.

Best

Haim
