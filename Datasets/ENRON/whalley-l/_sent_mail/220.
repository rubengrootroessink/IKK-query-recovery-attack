Chuck,

This is a read-only file.  I'm unable to print it out to show to Greg.  
Please provide me with a hard copy.  Greg doesn't read e-mail regularly.  I 
keep an eye on this e-mail and print out things that require his immediate 
attention.  You may want to deliver me hard copies of the P&Ls.

Liz

Greg, 

Here's the P&L as of last night.  When I get the newest one I'll forward it 
along.
