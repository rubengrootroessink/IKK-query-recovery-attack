we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with 
dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing 
anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts 
some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his 
technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with 
other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to 
them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team.  
he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward 
your message to him.

thanks for the heads up

greg
