i would be happy to meet with him, but i need to know exactly when because my 
september schedule is pretty ugly.  we have talked with rappaport about their 
eNymex project, but they do seem to be struggling for strategy.  it is really 
surprising that they lost money.  how did it happen?  volume couldn't have 
been down, given all the volatility.
