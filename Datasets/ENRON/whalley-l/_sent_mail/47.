Hi Bob,

I'll be sure to print your note out to Greg.

I have a couple of Enron folks wanting to come tomorrow.  Do you have two 
tickets left?

Liz

Subject: Keynote feedback


Greg,

Your keynote address hit the nail on the head this morning; it has already
spawned constructive discussions and debates, such as what services will the
core exchange(s) offer, what are secondary and tertiary strategies, and how
will various companies in the value chain support and benefit from the
exchanges.  One editor commented that your presentation offered stark
contrast to the Chevron presentation during lunch, which was a much more
passive "bring the horse to water" approach.  Tomorrow and Thursday's
presentations will address many of your points more fully.

Thank you very much for taking the time to drive out.  I realize how
difficult carving a morning from your schedule can be.  However, the
industry benefited from your insights.  Hopefully, Enron Net Works will
receive some high-quality prospects and/or recruits in return.

Yours sincerely,

Bob Nimocks
