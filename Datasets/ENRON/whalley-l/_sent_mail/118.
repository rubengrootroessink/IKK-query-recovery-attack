Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

Liz
