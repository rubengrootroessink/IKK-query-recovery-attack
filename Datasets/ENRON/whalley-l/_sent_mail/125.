Subject: All-Employee Meeting Update

The employee meeting will be broadcast live via webcast to our ENA field 
offices.  We have elected not to provide webcast to the Houston office to 
encourage employee attendance at the Hyatt.  

Please notify me by the end of the day today if you do not agree with this 
plan.

Thank you,
Elisabeth
