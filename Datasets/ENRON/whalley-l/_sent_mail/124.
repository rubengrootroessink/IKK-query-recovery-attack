  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
  Since the launch of HoustonStreet.com in July 1999, Houston Street Exchange

business-to-business exchanges for wholesale power trading.  HoustonStreet.com
recently announced plans to launch new Web-based platforms for trading crude

operates, and HoustonStreet.com is on the leading edge of the revolution.
Internet-based trading has exploded, and we believe that this investment will
allow us to play a significant role in the development of new markets and
platforms," said Bill Hobbs, president of Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

  "The investment in HoustonStreet.com is just one piece of Williams'
eBusiness strategy," added Nancy Gustine, director of eBusiness for Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading.  "By acquiring a stake in this innovator in the
electronic-exchange industry, we can capitalize on our marketing strengths
while helping them transform the trading industry."

  "To have one of the leading energy companies in the country invest in our
trading platform is a direct validation of our technology and our vision for
the future of energy trading" said Frank Getman, president and CEO of Houston
Street Exchange.  "We look forward to Williams' market strength and support in
creating the premier online energy trading platform across multiple
commodities."
