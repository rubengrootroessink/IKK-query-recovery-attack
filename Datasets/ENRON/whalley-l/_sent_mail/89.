We are pleased to announce that trading on our system will soon commence.  
And, as you may have heard, it will be commission-free.

We want to make sure you are ready to take advantage of our superior 
platform  and price. To further that end, attached to this email is our User 
Agreement in  Adobe PDF format. You may want to give this Agreement to your 
legal department  for their review as soon as possible. We fully expect that 
trading on our system  will commence on or before July 10th and we would love 
for you to be  among the first to trade on our system and stop paying 
commissions.

If you have not yet seen a demo please contact us to schedule yours.

Sincerely,
Pete Groetzinger
