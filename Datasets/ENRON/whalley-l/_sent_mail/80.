As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=
. =20
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=
e=20
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kick-off of the=
=20
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  Enron=01,=
s=20
United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate match).=
=20
ENW=01,s share of this goal is $161,700.  While these are aggressive goals,=
 they=20
are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we can easil=
y=20
surpass these goals.=20

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=
%=20
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has=20
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the=
=20
level.
=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=
=20
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across=
=20
the ENW organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=
=20
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our=20
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENW.  Your=20
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our=20
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENW by giving generously and=20
getting your pledges in by August 9th.
