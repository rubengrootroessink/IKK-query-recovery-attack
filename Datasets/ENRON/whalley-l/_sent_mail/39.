Subject: White Paper



Greg,
?
I had sent this white paper to Kenneth  Lay.?? When I followed up with him, 
his office suggested that I send  you a copy of our Offshore Development 
white paper.? Primarily, the white  paper addresses the reasons and cost 
benefits to offshore development.?  
?
SI Systems is an American company that specializes  in interfacing with 
global development centers to provide American?project  management and 
communications.? With the offshore model,  companies?reduce their IT 
budgets?significantly and the fact that the  development is offshore is 
transparent to our clients with SI Systems as the  interface team.?? Our 
clients do not have to communicate after hours  with another country to 
ensure their project is on track, we do that for  them.? Additionally, we 
offer ethics regulation to ensure that our  customers receive fair?and 
expected pricing throughout the project  lifecycle.
?
We have partnered with?10 of the best of breed  offshore companies to ensure 
that?we?can provide?a  variety?of application development languages with the 
best quality.?  Paul, I will follow up with you this week to see if?you?would 
like to  explore this model further.? 
?
High Regards,
?
