Stan,

As a follow-up to our previous 2002 Capital Plan meeting where we discussed the Cunningham base gas repurchase and SBA, attached is a file with two tabs that captures the contractual committments and some alternatives relative to repurchasing some, all or -0- base gas over the next year.

If possible, it would be good for us to have a short discussion regarding the economics and rate case impacts of the decision at the end of your Monday morning staff meeting.  I believe that we can determine how to include this in the 2002 Plan with just a few minutes of discussion.  If it appears that the discussion will need more time, we can then schedule a follow-up meeting.  Dave will be in Houston on Monday and will bring copies of the handouts for the discussion.  

If you would rather schedule a separate meeting on this please let me know, otherwise we'll try Monday morning.

Thanks, Kent
