Subject: Talking Points

Brad - I could not agree with you more.  We do not want to negotiate this i=
n the public arena. I felt the stories in the Calgary Herald, National Post=
 were unfortunate in timing and substance.=20

 As per your suggestion I have eliminated the last 2 bullets and attached t=
he talking points here.  The last bullet in the revised talking points was =
devised to take media pressure off of both us and the Producers.  There has=
 been an incredible amount of political hay being made with this project an=
d it has realized an inordinate amount of media attention.  We need to give=
 the media (only if asked or questioned - not to be released) some reasonab=
le expectations for time frames.  In any discussions we have with governmen=
t bodies or if questioned by media representatives we need to make it very =
clear we cannot discuss the terms of the proposal at this time and help the=
m understand that the Producers will have only received an executive summar=
y and the meeting in January will be the first glance at a large complex pr=
oposal and is intended to be the beginning of a process.  Outlining this ti=
meframe clearly stating there will be no immediate results from either rece=
iving the proposal or the early January meeting will hopefully set the medi=
a and government minds at rest that there is no story here for a while so n=
o need to dig further.  Normally a timeframe and a process is a better answ=
er than no comment.

Please let me know if you have any other concerns or would like to see addi=
tional revisions. =20

Michelle - - my comments are very much based on the impact of comments as=
=20
seen recently in TCPL's Calgary Herald article followed by the "scaled down=
=20
pipeline" article published by the Petroleum News Alaska:=20
   I firmly believe the less said in public before jan 8 discussions with=
=20
   producers the better off we are - we do not want to negotiate this deal=
=20
   in public.=20
   I'd prefer to keep advertisements down to a minimum and keep to the=20
   staight and narrow for now; hence,=20
   collapse the third and fourth bullets into one very concise bullet=20
   indicating a proposal being sent before year end to be followed up by a=
=20
   meeting in early Jan - I would not say anything further about whats in=
=20
   the proposal nor the attributes.=20
   Again, in the less said the better mode - I'd delete the last two=20
   bullets.=20

I appreciate Tony's email on Mr. Kvisle's comments and timing and can=20
understand how these types of things occur.  It indicates to me we need to=
=20
keep to a very tight script in all discussions (media and politicians=20
alike) until we make meaningful progress with the customer, hence my desire=
=20
to keep the talking points as brief as possible so we have the most=20
integrity with producers.  I'll defer to the collective wisdom of the group=
=20
since I have no real editorial comments on your talking points - my real=20
comment is policy-wise to keep them as brief as possible; i.e. all we=20
really need to say right now is we're going to be meeting with producers in=
=20
early jan on a pipeline proposal.  Thanks=20
