Joan, could you please set up a churn request to relocate Dave Neubauer's Houston office ECN3963 to ECN1354. Julie Armstrong (x33597) should be able to give you company/cost center for the move charges. Julie requested setting up this move after Linda Wehring's return next Monday, so request middle of next week churn date. Please also check with Linda (x36040) on Monday to see if she has anything to add to this request. Since this is not his primary office, there will not be very much to move other than equipment and furniture. Also should check 1354 to see if there is a marker board in there already or if we need to move one in there for him. 

Pat, could you please outfit ECN1354 with VP style furniture (granite racetrack, Mueller chairs, black drum table, along with Barritt guest chairs if they are not already in there) before next week? This will prevent moving the furniture from level 39, then having to replace it when I back-fill the office next week.

Thanks for your help!

Pam:

Please note that Dave Neubauer requested to move from the 39th floor to EB1354.  The EB1354 office is empty and ready for move-in.  

Danny has approved the move and the location on the 39th floor has been challenging for Dave in regards to administrative assistance and when staff/employees are trying to locate him. 

Please advise when we schedule Dave for a move.  It would be preferred to wait until Linda returns from vacation (week of October 19th) so we can properly handle the move.  

If you have any questions, please call me at x33597.  Thanks.
