For your info-  I will be having a tailgate party both pre and post game, regardless of outcome.  It is located at 9th and S on the east side of 9th street towards the southwest end of the lot where there is a large billboard advertising a 30$$ ++  Jackpot ( at least that's what it had on last weekend)   Please feel free to have the group join in if you get there in enough time.  Otherwise I will see you all at the game around 10:30.  Mary Kay
