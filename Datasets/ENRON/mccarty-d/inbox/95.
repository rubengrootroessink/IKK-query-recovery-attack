All:

	Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the utilization of the PAA Program at this point.  

	As noted, the remaining balance is now "pooled", but any requests should be submitted as soon as possible, and no later than 30 November.

Brian

As discussed in our staff meeting yesterday, the 2001 PAA Program will end effective December 3, 2001.  Any and all PAA/American Gift Check requests must be received on or before November 30 to allow time for processing.  

In addition, the total remaining balance may now be shared by all division heads.  The current balance as of the 11/13/2001is $126,950.00.
