Danny:
You should have received Rob, Eric and Joe accomplishments.  Dave and Kent are the only ones outstanding.
I tired to get you some Gallery Bowl tickets from Reliant but, no luck.
I will pay you back for lunch next week too.  Cheers.  Have a great holiday.
I am off to Radio Shack.  Phil at my apt. has me looking for a special connection/wire and feels certain that he can connect my DVD up.  The challenge is on!
