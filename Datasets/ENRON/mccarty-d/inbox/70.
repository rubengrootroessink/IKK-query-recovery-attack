Jean -

As requested, here is the breakdown of the costs of purchasing the TFT flat panels from Corp.  GSS is still working on the cost of the plasma, and I will get to you as soon as possible.

First Request for Gas Logistics:

50 15" flat panels @ $200.00/unit - $10,000.00
5   18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit -    2,250.00

Total:				   $12,250.00

2nd Request (Mary Kay Miller):

12 15" flat panels @ $200.00/unit - $ 2,400.00
4   18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit -    1,800.00

Total:				   $ 4,200.00

3rd Request (Verbal for Dan McCarty):

10 18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit - $ 4,500.00


As we have discussed, we still do not have approval from the Bankruptcy court to officially sell them to you, but we can "loan" them to you and once approval is gained, we can square away the cost.

Please call me at X58416 if you have any questions.

Have a great New Year!

Regards,

Mike
