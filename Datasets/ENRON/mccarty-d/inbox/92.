TCPL
First cut valuation complete
Produces strong cash flow; long-term growth; growing power business; substantially cleaned-up balance sheet
Risks lie in competition (Alliance, etc) and regulatory environment; minimal transmission growth near term

MRT/REGT
First cut valuation complete
Reliant had put assets up for sale in early 2000 but didn't get their price; current indications that they may want to sell
MRT looks appealing - storage opportunities; cash flow; St Louis market
REGT - old supply basin; stagnant market; old infrastructure
Next step is to refine analysis and determine approach to Reliant
