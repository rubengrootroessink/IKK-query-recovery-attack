I am just  getting caught up on the last few days e-mail.  This article, "Money Issue Threatens to Plug Alaska Highway Gas Route", was sent to me on Monday - I don't know if it has shown up in Gas Daily; however, I was surprised to see the past investments of the Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Company being referred to as "the meatball"; that "oil company lobbyists have been hyping the meatball issue to spike the Foothills project"; and, that everywhere on the Hill - people know about it.
