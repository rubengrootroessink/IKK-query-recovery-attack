Good morning Drew, here is a Confidentiality Agreement draft prepared by TransCanada to cover a joint venture by Enron, El Paso and TransCanada to build a new high pressure line from the Canada-US border to Chicago.  Please arrange to have the CA reviewed by yourself or one of your staff attorneys. If you need to discuss this with a TCPL attorney I would start with Donna Friesen  (403)920-7957.

Please find enclosed a draft CA for the McNeil bullet work for your
review.  I would like to highlight a couple of points;

- we had talked about a press release being issued by mid-December
during our initial meeting in Houston on Nov. 9.   The CA as currently
worded would require all parties concurrence on any press release.  In
meeting the spirit of the CA, TransCanada would like to state that it
would like to meet that deadline for issuing a press release and would
ask each of you to indicate whether you would support that or not.  We
will have some points available within a week outlining what we feel the
release would say but it would be similar to what we discussed
previously.

- on the issue of entities to be covered by the CA, we would ask that El
Paso consider a corporate entity rather than ANR.  Our reason is that
resources are likely to be seconded from groups other than ANR within El
Paso and we would like the CA to cover all relevant entities and
personnel directly than indirectly through ANR.

As a final note, the first draft of the Joint development agreement
should be ready late Wednesday.  Recognizing that Thursday is a holiday,
the draft should be on your email by Friday morning for your review. -
thanks - Paul
