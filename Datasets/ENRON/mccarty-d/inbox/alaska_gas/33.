Tony:

Steve Schroeder and I are traveling and have no independent comments.  Duke
likes Enron's comments, but I'm also open to deferral discussions on Monday
at 1:30.  Thanks

Gentlemen,

Yesterday, Enron provided comments on the MOU which raise several new
issues of substance. TransCanada & Westcoast recommend that these matters
be deferred and included with our discussions on the commercial proposal
and the Partnership Agreement, as we have agreed on a number of other
issues.

As we discussed on Tuesday's conference call, we believe the first priority
for ANNGTC is to finalize the MOU now, & put it "on ice", to permit all
parties to obtain the required governance approvals by Nov. 15 - also the
press release would be drafted, circulated & approved and ready to go at
that time.

Secondly, the commercial proposal to ANS Producers must be initiated in
early November to meet a mid-Dec. deadline. This proposal will of necessity
have the group addressing the large commercial alternatives in order to
establish a viable and attractive project.

We recommend a conference call on Monday @ 1:30 PM (Mountain time) to
finalize the MOU - we will arrange a dial-in #.. Please provide your
comments on the MOU to Murray & I today.


Tony
