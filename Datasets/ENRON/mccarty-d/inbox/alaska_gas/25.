Subject: Comments on Letter to Senator


Tony,

Peter is traveling today, and I am providing comments for him.  Please
replace the third sentence of paragraph 2 of Foothills' letter with the
language below.  Our revisions reflect the language we agreed to regarding
elimination or release of claims against the partnership, IF COMMERCIALLY
NECESSARY.  We are not otherwise willing to support the letter.  

"TransCanada, Foothills and the withdrawn partners are committed to
eliminating commercial barriers to construction of the ANGTS.  Accordingly,
if commercially necessary, they will release contingent claims against the
Alaska Partnership related to previous investments."


Please call with any questions or comments you may have.  Lauri.
