Eric, as I understand the FH/TCPL plan (which Enron is going along with) al=
l parties will at least initial (or is it sign ?- see MOU sec.11 re the pre=
ss release, where the language says the press release will announce the MOU=
 has been executed) the MOU with the language substantially as it is contai=
ned in the draft you sent at 4:16 pm yesterday.  While this draft does not =
refer to any concept of Non-Developing Parties, the MOU does not bind Enron=
 to become a Rejoining Partner in ANNGTC, and you have verbally told TCPL, =
El Paso and PGT that we are not going to rejoin until the old liabilities a=
re cleared up.  This should be communicated to all parties in writing in th=
e near future (see MOU Sec 17 re good faith intent of the parties regarding=
 the MOU transactions).   In light of the non-binding nature of the MOU, it=
 seems reasonable to go forward with the group under the proposed terms, ev=
en though Drew has prepared extensive comments on the MOU to introduce the =
Non-Developing Partner concept.  This concept can still be proposed during =
the next phase, when we work on amending the ANNGTC Partnership Agreement. =
 If we should talk further give me a call at 402=3D398-7888.  Bob Hill

All,

In the rush to get this MOU completed, Foothills and TCPL have addressed th=
e attached letter to Stan Horton as a single counterparty to the MOU, which=
 is not the agreed way forward.  The MOU will be revised
again to reflect the fact that all of the parties will appear on one
document--not each party executing only with TransCanada, Westcoast and
Foothills.=20

Please review and provide comments.

Thanks
