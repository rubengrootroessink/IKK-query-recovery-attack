I want to call your attention to the Meeting Notes #6  attached to this letter from the TCPL rep., Tony Palmer.  Last Wednesday TCPL made a run at throwing out of the Alaskan Project the historic costs (ie more than just the AFUDC and accrued interest).  I objected on behalf of Enron. However, as the notes indicate only TCPL thought it was a good idea, the others generally felt that as a "going in" position the costs had to be included in the Alaskan project  or they would never even be considered for inclusion by the Producers.  Note however that if negotiations ever get started between the ANNGTC Pipeline and the ANS Producers, the historic costs could again be an issue.  Bob.
