Rod,

We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
 project that has negative short term cash flow.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
 expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.

What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
 financial hurdle??????
