I was able to obtain an Alberta gas balance forecast for 2007.  This is not an "official" Enron view, but at least it provides some indication of the future.  Please advise if you have other info available.

Supplies (incremental)
- Alaska	4.0 Bcf/d
- Delta		1.5 Bcf/d
- WCSB	1.2 Bcf/d
Total		6.7 Bcf/d


Demands (incremental)
- Alta		(1.2) Bcf/d
- Alliance	(0.7) Bcf/d
- PGT		(0.5) Bcf/d
- TCPL		(1.4) Bcf/d
Total		(3.8) Bcf/d

Imbalance	~3.0 Bcf/d

Reasonable people can have different perspectives on this, but this indicates that infra-structure reinforcements and expansions is required downstream of the Alaska Highway Pipeline.

Michael Ratner: please have Jebong Lee liase with Julie Gomez to validate this gas balance.
