Normally, I'd say let him call you.  

I'm not worried about my relationship with Dennis but I am conscious that Stan is developing a relationship with Kvisle.  

I have no reason for changing our position on making no collective response to Sen. Murkowski during the telecon with Dennis at 5pm.  

Dennis believes that Enron's name is essential and that adopting a passive attitude with the politicians will not serve our interests on A==>B, which could damage our opportunities on B==>C.

Eric,
    Should I call Dennis, will he call me, or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize?

Dan

Danny,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own.
