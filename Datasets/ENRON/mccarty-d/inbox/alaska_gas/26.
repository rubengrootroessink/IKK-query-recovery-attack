All,

In the rush to get this MOU completed, Foothills and TCPL have addressed the attached letter to Stan Horton as a single counterparty to the MOU, which is not the agreed way forward.  The MOU will be revised
again to reflect the fact that all of the parties will appear on one
document--not each party executing only with TransCanada, Westcoast and
Foothills. 

Please review and provide comments.

Thanks
