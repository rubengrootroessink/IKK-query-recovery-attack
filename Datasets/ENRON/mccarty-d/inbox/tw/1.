It sounds like the costs will come down some but I have a few comments. Fir=
st, I'm not sure that lowering the amount of compression to California sinc=
e those shippers are not willing to pay the full rate is a good thing. I be=
lieve the California piece may actually be needed to carry the whole projec=
t. They may not pay the rate calculated as part of this project but I do be=
lieve if our timing is right we can do 300,000/d from San Juan to the borde=
r for the PG&E deal at more economic rates. Second, my understanding is tha=
t the ROW costs for the Navajo will be taken out of the project in return f=
or giving the Navajo equity interest in the project. Centilli needs to make=
 sure that he reduces the revenue back to ETS by this amount (he may not kn=
ow this yet). Also, giving the Navajo an equity interest sets a very diffic=
ult precedent with regard to future expansions or ROW extensions (we tried =
to stay away from something like that this last round because we knew it wo=
uld cost us more in the end).

Danny,

I met with Phil Lowry, Jerry Martin, John Keller, and Kevin Hyatt to discus=
s the revised cost estimates for Sun Devil.  My blood pressure has eased so=
mewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level =
more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers wa=
nt to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further sq=
ueeze the cost bundle.
 =20
Here's a quick recap-

$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open seaso=
n.
$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season=
.
$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc

The difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM. =20

Of this, $218 MM relates to-

-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)
-[$44] MM for 36" pipe vs 30" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to=
 be confirmed by the engineers.
-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)
-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition
-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in=
 original estimate)
-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the =
original scope)

We can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original pro=
ject scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won=
't overbuild with 36" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippe=
rs pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future =
shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the =
amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying=
 anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on =
finding other potential savings.

The remaining $109 MM comes under the category of "identified risks".  Esti=
mates are provided in current dollars and the "escalation" component highli=
ghts the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little re=
cent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs f=
or Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discuss=
ions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - =
- seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust.
