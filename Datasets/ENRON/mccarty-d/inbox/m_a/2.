I wanted to confirm where we are and give you the chance to redirect me if =
necessary.  I understand that John Goodpasture expects to leave, apparently=
 around the end of the month.  I have also been advised that Steve Dowd is =
getting up to speed on the MOPS deal and will be prepared to jump in if nec=
essary.  Per my conversation with John this morning, I understand John inte=
nds to validate the list of open issues with Dan McVay today.  It is possib=
le that the key issue--the "material adverse effect" clause--has been elimi=
nated along the lines you, John and I outlined in your office about 10 days=
 ago.   If not, we will need to discuss with you our recommendation for res=
olving the open issues by tomorrow or Wed. and then present that recommenda=
tion to Stan for his decision as necessary.  Armed with that decision on th=
e scope of our authority, John would be able to try to close the deal this =
week.  If that chronology holds up John's departure plans should not be a p=
roblem.  Otherwise, the handoff to Steve will need to happen and we'll clos=
e the remaining issues as soon as possible thereafter.  I will keep you pos=
ted on any material changes in where we are.  Thanks. DF
