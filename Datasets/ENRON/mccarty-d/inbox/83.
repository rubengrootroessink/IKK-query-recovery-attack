Danny:
This completes your direct reports accomplishments.  Please note that two-online contracts (#42895, #42941) were approved by Craig Buehler.  
Also that I spoke with HR about the termination letters and big mistake.  Apparently many people received the letters due to massive mailing.  Please note that if you receive letter, it halts your contribution to your savings plan.  I will send out notice to your direct reports in case someone else received same form letter.
Dave Neubauer called in to see if there was any news on Northern.  Word is out that Citibank is ready to proceed on Trading deal.
I saw that you called in today but, when I called you were working out.  I spoke with Ben who told me about the electronic scooter (the coolest thing he got for Christmas).  Everything is fine.  Have a relaxing holiday!
