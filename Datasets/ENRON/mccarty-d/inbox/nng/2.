Maybe there is a way to skin this cat.     The service fee can have any num=
ber of scheduled payments, and have any life we need (or can get the other =
party to agree to) and that way we maybe able to pay them up front (non-fin=
anced) and amortize the amount to be paid over the life of the deal.     Do=
n't take my word as gospel since accounting rules are changing as we speak,=
 we need to get Jim to give us the parameters we would need in order to pas=
s the audit.=20

I have not been included in discussions of this transaction. FYI, to me, a =
prepayment for a service contract would generally be amortized over the lif=
e of the contract.

I do see that Bob was referenced in Dave's response.=20
Bob - comments?

I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do=
 we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off=
?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that=
 we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think abo=
ut it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and v=
alued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been =
done.        =20

I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goa=
l line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that =
we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a num=
ber of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?

Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to l=
ook for a better deal?=09

Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can=
't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense ov=
er the life of the deal?

Rod,

Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.

Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected=
 wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei=
r original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and a=
re expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to mod=
el and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would=
 be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing =
the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out t=
he project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to=
 treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob =
Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent ha=
s indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.=20

As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into =
a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells =
and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f=
ield.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu=
lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s=
pend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 y=
ears of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield=
 well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has c=
ommitted $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to thi=
s project for a total of $1.5MM.

Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that =
they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Hallibu=
rton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the re=
ason for high return requirement. =20

The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a=
n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third=
 party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, prelimi=
nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b=
etween $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for =
the out years. =20

Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming u=
p with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   =
An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up =
with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have revi=
ewed the proposal?

Rod,

We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
 project that has negative short term cash flow.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
 expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.

What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
 financial hurdle??????
