Subject: Culture Committee

The Culture Committee Meeting originally scheduled with Ken Lay for Thursday, September 6, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM has been cancelled.
Beth and I have been asked to pull together recommendations for the Management Committee offsite on Friday, as a result of the All Employee Survey sent out last week. We would like to share our recommendations with you tomorrow from 1:30 to 2:30 in Conference Room EB16C1. We are very sorry for the short notice. If you cannot attend, please let us know and we will send you a copy of our recommendations. Again, sorry for the last minute notice. We look forward to seeing those of you who can make it.
Thanks, 
Cindy Olson
