For all concerned: We will only have 2 hours to cover a wide range of topics and Tracy will be working with Stan on the time allotments and expected content. She will be getting back in touch with you after our more detailed reviews with Stan, scheduled for Oct 11th (PGE) and Oct 12th (ETS & EREC) to begin to get the actual presentations set up. If anyone believes they need some one else to attend this planned review meeting with Ken Lay for support or other purposes, please let me know.
