Stan,
     The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x  EBITDA  with a valuation more in the range of $180m.  While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.  They have yet to respond.  In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.

Dan

At 7 to 8 times EBITDA I think the valuations should be in the range of $85 to $100 million.  Both EOTT and NBP's have bought assets in this valuation range.
