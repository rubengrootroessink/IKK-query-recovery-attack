Rick,
     I thought that there was $553,000 due from ENA for November capacity release.  Who are the original shippers on the other $348,000?

FYI -  Elizabeth forwarded the letter attached below to the ENA contacts listed along with a courtesy copy to Citizens.  The amount of the reservation payments that are outstanding and will revert back to Citizens is $205,755.  Citizens recalled this capacity on 11/30/2001 and will pay TW directly for December business.

Stephanie/Chris,

Please see the attached letter notifying Enron North America Corp. of outstanding transportation invoice amounts payable to Transwestern Pipeline Company for capacity acquired from Citizens Communications Company for November 2001, which were due on December 14, 2001.  Feel free to contact me at (713) 853-6928 if you have any questions related to these transactions.
