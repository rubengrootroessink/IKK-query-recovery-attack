Dave,
   FYI. I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination. Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything. How can we get these answers?

Dan
