Cindy, 
    No.  This are working meetings which kick off the due diligence review for each of the withdrawn partners. So, everyone will be sending their worker bees only.

Hi everyone,

The following is an update on the timing of meetings for next week.  Note
that we have moved the Regulatory Session to October 11th.  Curt Moffatt
(from Van Ness) is not available next week due to the ANGTA Senate hearings.
I believe that you will appreciate having Curt at the session once you see
the knowledge that he brings on such matters.  Please let me know if this
will work with your schedules.

Could everyone confirm your attendance for the meetings next week with the
following information in an email to marty.heeg@foothillspipe.com
