No, and I'd like to know who in my group is using it for 135.31/mo.  Can they tell me that?

Hi Julie.  I'm checking with all of the people who are current users on the Prophet X software (FIMI) to see if they still want to keep their access.  Danny was added as a user several months ago.

I will be removing a few users who have left the company, and I just thought I would check with you and see if Danny was still interested in maintaining his access to the Prophet X software.  FYI, the monthly charge to his RC is $135.31.

Please let me know what he would like to do as soon as possible, and I will take the appropriate action to either maintain his connection to the server or have it deleted if that's what he wants to do.

Thanks for your help!
