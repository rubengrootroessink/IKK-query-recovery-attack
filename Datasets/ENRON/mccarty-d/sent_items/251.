Eric,
      I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to Audrey after I got a call from Cindy looking to find Julie or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.

Dan
