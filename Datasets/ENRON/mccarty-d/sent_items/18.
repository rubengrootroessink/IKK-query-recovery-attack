Steve,
      This is landing at a bad time.  I'm going to be in Omaha going over the 2002 plan, and doing other business.  Unfortunately, I cannot reschedule this one so I'll have to miss the Wine fest.

Thank you for your hard work and your continued commitment to the March of Dimes. 

Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002.

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.
