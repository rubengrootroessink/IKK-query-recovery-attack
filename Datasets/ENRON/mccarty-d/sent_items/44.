Danny,
CTN, a subsidiary of the SGA, is  seeking a corporate sponsor for the special security broadcast described  below.  We hope Enron will join other industry leaders as  a sponsor.  We would also welcome someone from you organization  on the program, should you wish.  Sponsors will enable us to make the  program available to companies as a web cast and to include more agency and  government presenters by using studios in D.C. 
Major sponsorships are available for this  broadcast at $15,000 and $25,000.  Host sponsorships are $2500.   Your sponsorship will enable you to receive the program down linked at  your office and be invited to the dinner with participating executives on  October 31.  
Please let me know who else I should  present this opportunity to at Enron.  We plan to send the initial news  release this Friday.  I will have additional content information after the  committee meets later this week.  
I attached the brochure from our Special  broadcast in October so you can see the type of publicity we will be  sending.  Our standard viewer reach is 100,000 employees.   Because of the nature of this broadcast, we expect the numbers to be much  higher.  Vicky Bailey or Joe Kelleher, Asst. Secretary, DOE have agreed to  be on the program, pending no significant changes in world  events.  FERC Commissioner Brownell and Andrew Lundquist from V.P.  Cheney's office have also expressed an  interest.
Thanks for your  consideration,
Mary  Landrum
CTN Marketing  Director
