Julie,
Deb refers to "bowl tickets".  I assume that she means "playoff tickets", since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the BCS Bowls (which is after the playoffs in Dallas).

Deb:
Originally, Danny requested 20-25 and your last notice was for 8 tickets.  I did not realize that Mary Kay's request was part of Danny's request. I will discuss with him in the morning.  Was the 8 ticket notice for Danny, Mary Kay and Mike ?

Dan, Mary Kay would like to have 4 bowl tickets.  In my original request to the University for tickets, her request was in the mix.  Mary Kay called me today to see if she was going to get any tickets.  

My question is: how do you want me to allocate the tickets I have so far?
