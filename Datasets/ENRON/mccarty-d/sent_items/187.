Dan - Barbara Lucero has not been an active contract employee for quite some time.  In fact, I had never heard of her.  This was discussed with Human Resources  last week and she was deleted from the SAP system as of November 30th.

All,
    As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.  Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.  Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.  Upon completion, please forward it to me.

Dan

Danny:

	Below is a list of six contractors within your organization.  We need to determine whether any are performing critical, indispensable tasks.  If so, fine.  If not, I need to assist you in processing them out.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible.  Please bear in mind that the presumption is that they are not critical -- there needs to be ample justification to retain.  This exercise is being done for all contractors throughout ETS.

Ronald Abraham	Omaha			working for Dave Neubauer
Van Dickerson		Houston		working for Eric Gadd (already been decided to let go)
Barbara Lucero		Bloomington, MN	working for Mike McGowan
India Torres		Houston		working for Robert Burleson (Neubauer's org)
Jeanette Doll		Houston		working for Walter Lokey (Kilmer's org)
Francis Clements	Omaha			working for Tim Kissner (Mary Kay Miller's org)
