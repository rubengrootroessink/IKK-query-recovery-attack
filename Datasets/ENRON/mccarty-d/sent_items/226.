Since to bulk of these will be used for employees, I'd like to try and get 20-plus tickets through Deb---not hospitality ones.

Danny:

If we want individual tickets, we should make the request through Deb.  $60.00 and $70.00 range.

Otherwise, please see the Group Ticket packages.

Bronze $4000 = $200 per ticket
http://www.swbellcottonbowl.org/big12/tickets/Big%2012%20Group%20Ticket%20Order%20Form.pdf

Web site shows $60 & $40 tickets are sold out.

No tickets are available (at this time) on the Huskers web site.

Please advise.
