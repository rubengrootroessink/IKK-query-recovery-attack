Danny,

I am sending you our latest presentation.  I am very disturbed by yesterday's events, I knew many traders that worked between WTC and WFC--yet I realize that our work has to continue.  I don't know if you will be flying with Mark this week, at any case you now have the latest version of our business concept.  If you have any questions please call me at 30315 or (mobile) 713 269 1777.

Hamd
