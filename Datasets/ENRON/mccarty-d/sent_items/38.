- Fuel prices stay below Plan numbers and we can not hedge at a price even close to what is in the Plan as a base amount much less meet stretch.

-Basis spreads between East and West stay depressed causing the Mavrix and remaining Red Rock space to be valued at margins of $.00 to $.05 going West (also, the demand stays low out West because of weather).

-We can not renegotiate the ROFR contracts prior to expiration and we end up getting the capacity handed back to us in a depressed market.
