John,
      I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.  All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.  Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.  Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.

Dan

I talked with Rod and Bob Hayes and they say the discussion with Stan at his meetings tends to compare the current month to that month in the last Current Estimate because (which I didn't know) the Current Estimate is the last number that Corporate has seen.  The QTRly Forecasts are not published upstairs.

In an effort to produce a document on the Web that all the VPs could use, would you consider publishing the Weekly Net Commercial Contribution Summary that compares to Current Estimate instead of the QTRly Forecast or try to squeeze a comparison to Current Estimate also?

Whaddya think?
