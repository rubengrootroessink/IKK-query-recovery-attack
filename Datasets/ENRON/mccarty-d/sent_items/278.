Stan,
       In response to your questions today:

            1. Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (Sean Bolks being the lead).  As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.

            2. Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (Pat Shortridge).  Other than that, they provide no value.
      
            3. Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.

            4. Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.  We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.

Dan
