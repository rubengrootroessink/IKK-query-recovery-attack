Richard,
       Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.
       Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.

Dan

Hey Danny,

Everyone here at ICC is praying for our Enron "alumni" back in Houston, and
I hope you and the family are ok.

I just wanted to check in on you and see how you are weathering this storm;
it's got to be indescribably gut wrenching.
fyi, we are coming back; me in January to work for Stan Babiuk in Major
Projects and the family will return early March.  Everyone is still in
denial, but it is best for me right now.  EP Europe is definitely not where
I need to be in the short term.

Drop me a note back if you get a spare minute.
take care
