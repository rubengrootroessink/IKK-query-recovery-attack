John,
    That is fine, but I'd also like to see current month to Plan as well, as this will be of particular interest next year.

Danny, in the past the pipes have chosen different comparisons when they have issued their individual margin comparisons each Friday onto the Website.   Some have chosen to compare the current month to the current month in the 3rd Current Estimate OR to the current month in the last QTR Forecast.  

Now that we are providing you a Summary page we need to be consistent on that Summary at least.  I would recommend that we compare the current month to the current month in the last QTR Forecast since that is the last published Forecast you and Stan have seen.  Any objections?
