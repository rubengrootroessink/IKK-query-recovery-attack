Danny,

To keep you updated, we are reorganising our Merchant Energy function
globally, and John Hushon, CEO of Europe (my direct boss) is leaving end of
the year.  As a result, I have put activated my own return to the US and it
looks like I will be moving to Jay Holm/Stan Babiuk's group as Director of
Project Development in Major Projects.  It could be fun, depending on how
much running room they will let me have.  It will be nice to get back up to
speed on the US side as well.

I'll be back in Houston effective January 1, and the family is moving end of
February.  It should be official by the end of the week, as soon as I get
some HR items nailed down.  Anyway, you know before most El Paso people do,
so please don't mention anything just yet.

Also, I know it's tough times right now.  Just wanted to let you know that
I'm praying for you and my many other Enron friends right now.  Hang in
there man.

I'll be in touch.
