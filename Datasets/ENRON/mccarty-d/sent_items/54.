Eric,
      FYI, I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once.  I called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call.  I called again today and received no return call.  You may have a good relationship with these guys, but I think that John may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity.  I'll try one more time, then I'll call it quits.

Dan
