Shelley,
       I was thinking just revenue, but we can just as easily do O&M, too.  Which would you prefer?

I'll be at the meeting Friday.  Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.   Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M?

Shelley,
       I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.

Dan
