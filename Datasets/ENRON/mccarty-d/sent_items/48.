Dennis,
     I'm fine with the letter.  And, I think that it should be well received.

A development out of Washington today was Daschle's instruction to
Bingaman to take energy legislation directly to the floor of the Senate
and bypass the mark-up process in the Committee. Although this doubtless

primarily driven by ANWR dynamics, we do not know whether any Alaskan
gas line legislation is to be part of a Bingaman bill or not. It does
underscore the need to make a vigorous representation to the Senators
from our re-enlistment group. I'd appreciate that you can provide a
response to my email from yesterday containing a draft letter from
ANNGTC/Foothills on behalf of the re-enlisting partners. I'll be in my
office throughout the day . So look forward to your help.
