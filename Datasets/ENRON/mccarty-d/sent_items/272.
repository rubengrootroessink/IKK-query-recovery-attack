Cindy,
     For what it's worth, I am quite opposed to going forward with the Enron Christmas Party as planned.  With as much negative press as we've gotten, we are assured that the local TV stations and the Chronicle will cover it, and will put the "lavish" affair in the worst light possible.  Can't we stop it now??

Dan
