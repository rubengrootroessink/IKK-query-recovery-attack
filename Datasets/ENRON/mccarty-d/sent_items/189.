I just verified with Kinder Morgan that Northern Natural will receive appr. $144,000 for refunds related to an  excess deferred income tax refund issue .  It applies to a time where NNG did not have a tracker and thus can be retained by NNG and does NOT need to be refunded to our shippers.

This $144,000 reflects incremental cash and income for NNG for 2001 and will be received by wire transfer at the end of the month.
