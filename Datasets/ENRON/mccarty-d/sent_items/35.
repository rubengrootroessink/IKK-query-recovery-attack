Pat,
   Thanks.  I appreciate the input. Let me know if anything pertaining to the specific routing of the line begins to bubble up.

Danny -

Yesterday Senator Bingaman held a hearing in the Senate Energy Committee on the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline.  The main items to come out of it were, (1) willingness of Bingaman and the committee to speed regulatory approval and (2) willingness to provide financial incentives for companies developing the pipeline.  They discussed routes but that's all they did.

I have press accounts and a copy of Pat Wood's testimony from yesterday if any of that is of interest to you.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,

Pat Shortridge
