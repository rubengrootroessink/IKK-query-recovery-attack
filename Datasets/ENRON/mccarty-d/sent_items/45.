Voluntary Severance Program

We told you in our message last Thursday that details of the program would be given to you by today. If he or she has not done so already, your business unit head will be scheduling a meeting shortly to discuss the impact of the program on your group.

If you are interested in finding out more about the program , you should visit the Change Programme page on the Enron Europe Intranet site, which contains full details, including a payment calculator, FAQs and an application form. Clicking on the hyperlink below should take you directly to the page.

Thank you.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown
