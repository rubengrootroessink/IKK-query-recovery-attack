Kent,
     I understand your concern, but at this point, I may have to tell you who the "right" person is for the time being.  I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.   Whatever is done, I can assure you that your "right" choice to fill any position will be from within our group, and will make sense from an overall ETS Commercial perspective.

Dan

Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.
