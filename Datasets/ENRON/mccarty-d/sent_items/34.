Dan, Ken Rice suggested that I contact you directly after a conversation we
had. I will be leaving Texaco at the end of this month as a result of the
Chevron/Texaco merger and will be in the marketplace looking for
opportunities. I was talking to Ken about the idea of initiating a
consultative sales approach with NNG's customer base and selling Enron's
extensive portfolio of capabilities. In addition to that I have a business
opportunity that  provides a real time, web-based measurement technology
that may enhance operating capabilities and allow additional services. In
discussions with people at NNG that was an area of unexplored opportunity..
but I haven't gotten any resolution. I would appreciate a phone
conversation, if any of this sparks your interest. I talked to Julie and she
said you had received my resume from Ken and it was forwarded to Dave in
Omaha.  Thank you for your consideration. Fred M. 402-493-1113 (office)
