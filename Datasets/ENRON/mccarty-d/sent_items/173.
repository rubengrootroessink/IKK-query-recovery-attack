Greg,
     I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.  He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.  This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.  Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay.
     Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.

Dan
