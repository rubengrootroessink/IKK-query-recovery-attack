Stan/Danny,
 
I tried to call you today to let you see the announcement I am running on a number of org changes including Steve Hotte. Unfortunately you were both in the air and I am away next week, so I've run it anyway. I'm pretty sure we have all the bases covered and  you guys wont have any problem with it.
 
Best Regards

Mark Pickering
