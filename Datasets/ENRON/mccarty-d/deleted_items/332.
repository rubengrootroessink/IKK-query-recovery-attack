I have suggested we consider however, giving a day off costs money we may not have.

Subject:	Suggestion for holidays


In light of recent events and the cancellation of the Holiday party, Danny McCarty suggested that Monday, December 31st be offered as a "free" holiday in addition to the 2001-2002 Holiday schedule.  Since New Year's Day is on a Tuesday, many people will either take Monday as vacation or want to take the day but, have utilized their vacation days.
