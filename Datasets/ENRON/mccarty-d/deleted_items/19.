Is he returning as an Associate? Is Billy Lemmons coordinating his trip?

Janet,
       I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.

Dan

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron
