Danny, 
I received three letters stating that since I am no longer with Enron I can access and move my savings plan.  These three letters, no one but three is very upsetting right before Christmas. I was going to call you but I hate to brother your hoilday.  I pray this is a huge oversight but yet I received three letters. I will call Gary and Fran on Wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me.  Happy holidays.
