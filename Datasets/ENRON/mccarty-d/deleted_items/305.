Ever really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Joel
