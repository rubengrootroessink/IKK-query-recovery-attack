Dennis and all "partners":

I agree with Dennis on the need to meet with the Gov -  ASAP.  Governor
Knowles office called Duke directly stating his desire to meet around the
30th.  On my request his office is trying to determine what might be done
around the 29th instead.  I've also got an initial email into the three ANS
producers indicating the ANNGTC principles being in Anchorage around that
date and am awaiting their response to a meeting.  More next week.  The
meetings in D.C. went well, especially on the republican side.  Our
collective involvement is impressive - I'm glad to work with each of your
companies.  Have a good weekend.
