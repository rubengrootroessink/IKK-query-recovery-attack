Release 01255 
AGREEMENT CLEARS HURDLE FOR ALASKA HIGHWAY GASLINE
Knowles Hails Agreement Among Pipeline Partners as Essential Step 
Gov. Tony Knowles hailed today's agreement among six major American energy firms and three Canadian firms as a major step toward development of the Alaska Highway Natural Gas Pipeline project. Foothills Pipeline Company of Calgary announced today the signing of a memorandum of understanding that sets out principles for regrouping the former partnership to eliminate barriers to construction of the Alaska Highway project.

Gov. Knowles made the following comment: 
"Today's announcement by Foothills and other pipeline companies that a major hurdle has been cleared is great news for the Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline project. These major international pipeline companies have now endorsed the pipeline route and are bullish about the project. It's time to get on with the business of advancing a project that's good for Alaska and good for America.

"The oil and gas producers have long said a major impediment to the Alaska Highway project is this so-called 'accrued liability' potentially owed to Foothills and the original partners of the Northwest Pipeline project. Now that that's been resolved, it's time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies, the State of Alaska and other players to get this project underway.

"The Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline will put America to work at a time when the Lower 48 economy is teetering on a recession and when American consumers are demanding affordable, environmentally friendly energy. Alaskans overwhelmingly support this project because it will provide good jobs for Alaskans, affordable energy for our communities and revenues to pay for vital services."
