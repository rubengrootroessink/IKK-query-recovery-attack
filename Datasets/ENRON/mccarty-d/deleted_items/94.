I have made inquiries about our information stored out on the network and on Outlook as was discussed this morning.  Regarding the deletion of these documents we are storing once the project winds down, if you are keeping emails and attachments in folders on Outlook they will remain on an offsite backup system for only 7 days.  In other words, after this project is over with you can empty the file of everything and be assured that 7 days later there will be no trace anywhere on Enron's system.

If, however, you have stored any documents in any feature of our network (this includes any Enron software package backed up on our servers) i.e., our private ANNGTC folder out on the P drive, we can empty the folder and delete everything or not, that information remains on a backup tape for 7 years.

This information was just furnished by our Houston IT group.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but please email me with any questions.
