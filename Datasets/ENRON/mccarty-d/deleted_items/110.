Let's discuss how you are approaching this with Anderson.  I am very interested in their opinions - - - 

Thanks,

yes it is for Andersen
we are evaluating the possibility to "writeup" our old interest in ANNGTC give renewed interest
in the venture

Hi Jim, yes there are files available. Is this for Arthur Andersen ? (I could not tell from Heather's e-mail address)  We have a task force looking into this on behalf of Enron and there is a data room that would have the old Partnership Agreement. This data is under a confidentiality agreement, so I would say contact Drew Fossum about it.  If that is a problem, I have a copy of the old ANNGTC Partnership Agreement (pertaining to the Alaskan segment of ANGTS) that I extracted from InterNorth's old files last summer.  Let me know. Bob Hill. 402-398=7888.

Bob,
Can you help Jim out on this?

Jim,
Bob has been the focal point for any of our discussions related to Alaska.  Hopefully he can provide what you are looking for.

patty or bob - do you have any "old" files related Internorth's participation in the ANGTS partnership in the late 70's early 80's?

Jim -

Any luck in locating a copy of the partnership agreements so we can review
the withdrawal right provisions related to ANGTS?

Heather
