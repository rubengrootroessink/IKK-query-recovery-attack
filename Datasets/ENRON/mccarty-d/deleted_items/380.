Brad,

Unfortunately, due to current operating conditions at Enron, neither Bob Hill nor I are able to be in Anchorage for dinner with the producers.  Please convey our regrets.  I'd appreciate a debrief at your convenience.

Regards,

Eric

   We shlould plan on meeting at Marx Bro's early, around 5:30pm for a
   drink and a quick coordination effort.
   Attendance is limited to one person per company - please forward this
   email to the appropriate party if you cannot attend .
   Also, please confirm with me who'll be attending so I can get a
   definitive head-count.

Thanks - see you there.
