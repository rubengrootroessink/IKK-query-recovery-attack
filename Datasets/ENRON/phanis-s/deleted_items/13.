Sara gave two lists to Harlan to look at if you want to coordinate with him.  Gerald also has the list from yesterday that will need to be reviewed.  Thanks.

Can someone call Ed Baughman regarding Wabash Valley Power Association and whether or not this contract has been properly terminated?  Also, I have some termination lists that need to be reviewed.  Please let me know if you can review them.

Thanks,
Stephanie
