REPORT - THE POWER INDUSTRY:  LESSONS FROM OTHER CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES

*	We recommend reading our attached report.
*	We interviewed six analysts who cover cyclical commodity industries.
These include: airlines, chemicals, oil/refining, paper and forest products,
semiconductors, and semiconductor equipment.
*	What are the lessons for the Power industry?...Where are we on the
cycle?
*	The answer lies in the relationship between capacity and pricing.
*	Although we do not draw a conclusion here, we will be analyzing the
factors which answer these questions. 
*	We think you will find the framework we've established useful in
thinking about these issues.
