> Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank

> purpose is to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to
> the Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water
> system to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the
> units while this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this
> outage is requested.
