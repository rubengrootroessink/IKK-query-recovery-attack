With our 5th National Championship in hand, I wanted to keep you up to speed on the championship apparel we are selling for All Sports.  Harry has almost 100 items in the online store with more being added every day. We have more than double of any other provider so for best selection, make sure to visit our online store here:

All Sports has been the #1 Miami Hurricane shop since 1959 and continues to add new products on a daily basis.  Keep an eye on the store for new items daily.

Also with national signing day coming up in just a few short weeks, Grassy.com has partnered with Prep Films to bring Cane fans the only highlight video available for the 2002 Miami Hurricane recruiting class.  This is shaping up to be our best class of all time possibly.  If you are a Grassy.com club member, we are knocking off 25% and giving you the video basically at our cost.  To order, please go here:

If you're looking for the latest news and updates on the Canes, this is the place:)

As always send any feedback and/or questions to me and I'll make sure you are taken care of.  Here is to a successful 2002!

GO CANES!!!
