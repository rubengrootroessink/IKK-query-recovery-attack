RESPONSE DUE TO SERC OFFICE BY OCTOBER  22, 2001  
SERC Engineering Committee Representatives
It is time to determine member voting rights and membership  assessments for the year 2002. Again this year, we will calculate these  percentages based on the formula agreed to at the April 27, 1994 meeting of the  SERC Board of Directors:
    V = 10 ( 1/N) + 30(B/C) + 30(D/E) +  30(F/G)
where,
    V = % of Voting Rights
    N = Total number of Members
    B = Member's previous-year internal peak  demand
    C = Total of factor B for all  Members
    D = Member's generating capacity as of  January 1 of the reporting year
    E = Total of factor D for all  Members
    F = Sum of circuit miles of transmission  times the respective operating voltage for facilities of 69 kV and above as of  December 31 of the previous year
    G = Total of factor F for all  Members
 
The required data are: 
1) Peak Demand for the calendar year 2000, 
2) Total Capacity owned as of January 1, 2001, and  
3) Circuit miles of transmission owned as of December 31,  2000.
As a precaution, remember that 1) generation under joint  ownership, 2) generation belonging to non-members of SERC, and 3) non-utility  generation will have to be coordinated between the involved  parties.
The attached worksheet contains the information that I  have in my database for 2001. 
Please update this worksheet and return to me (tglaze@serc1.org ) no later than October  22.
Thank You.
