The info is reasonably well protected, but it is potentially subject to disclosure to other parties.  I have a call in to Christi to see if she's found out which types of entities can get access.  In any event, the information will not be identified as having been submitted by Enron.

I hope I haven't taken you in a circle, I just wanted to make sure that it is clear that some entities may have access to our pricing, but they won't know for sure that it is Enron's pricing.

I want to make sure the info is protected and if legal and regulatory are comfortable, then I am.

Kevin,

I spoke with the lawyer representing Entergy, and he indicated that their intention is to provide redacted bid information to the PUC under a protective order.  Excluded from their submittal will be any identifying information about each of the bidders. Their lawyer said that Enron's bid sheet (without identifying info) and contract comments (with no identifying info) would be submitted. Obviously, pricing info will be included.  In order to acquire the filed information, someone must qualify as a "Party" and must agree to be bound by the terms of the protective order.  Heather tells me Christi Nicolay was looking into the definition of "Party".  I do not know if our competitors could qualify as Parties, but if they do, then common sense tells me that we should, too. At this point we should assume that they will get the redacted information.

Seems like Entergy is doing what they can to protect the info, and our only choice I can think of would be to withdraw our bid.  Heather tells me we want to go forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay
