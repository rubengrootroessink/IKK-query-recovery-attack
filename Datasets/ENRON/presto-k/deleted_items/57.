Kevin, the fills are good.  The first 2,100 sold at the bid immediately 7
seconds
after being entered.  The bid then moved to 21.75 but you executed at
21.78 on the remaining shares 14 seconds later.  I will email you
time and sales if you would like.  Your trade is attached.

David

These are not good fills.   When I gave the order DIS was trading at 21.87
(21.86 at 21.88).   I can understand 2-3 cents but not 9 cents.
