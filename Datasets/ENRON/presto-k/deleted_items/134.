Kevin & Tim --

Attached is EPSA's standard market position that they will push next week at FERC.  It is a great start on what I think that UBS Warburg Energy will want to push.  I think that we should discuss joining EPSA as quickly as possible to make sure that we have a vehicle to insert our views into the activities at FERC on future market structures ($175k per year).  

Any issues?

Jim

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee

FROM: Bob Reilley, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Tim Thuston, Regulatory Affairs Committee Vice Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: January 30, 2002

RE: Preparation for FERC Workshops on Standard Market
      Design
      ?Conference Call on Friday, February 1st at 11:00 a.m. (EST)

Based on discussions at the Regulatory Affairs Committee Meeting and our meeting with the FERC staff earlier this week, we have drafted a "Bare Essentials" leave-behind for the Standard Market Design workshops at FERC next week.  Like the "Bare Essentials" developed for RTO week last fall, the bullets are focused on big picture issues where significant consensus was developed.  Because we do not yet have a detailed agenda for next week, we have designed the leave-behind to track our key issues.

As we also discussed on Monday, Craig Roach has been asked by the Chairman's office to prepare a possible new approach to market power under a standard market design.  Craig is developing a draft paper for consideration, which will be circulated for review early tomorrow.
We will be holding a conference call on Friday, February 1st at 11:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss the draft leave-behind and Craig's paper.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.   If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact Julie Simon at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.
