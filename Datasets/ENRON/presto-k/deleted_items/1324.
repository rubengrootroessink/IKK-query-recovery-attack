Let me share something with you.  I have included a link of the manufacturer's pricing to the Dealer-by Kelley Blue Book.(New or Pre-Owned)  There's no need to run all over town shopping for a vehicle.  You just drive to the person who shows you the real numbers.(Me)  By attaching the link for dealer cost, it will be obvious that you are getting a GREAT DEAL!(Wholesale Price)  I'll try to make this as easy as possible folks.  If you are not ready at this time, that's okay!   This is not a high pressure car buying program.  What I do ask of you is that you WRITE DOWN & REMEMBER who got you all of the pertinent information to make your car buying decision.(Ken Finney)  See below.. 
  
Some of you don't know it yet, but your company may be a partner with Ford.  If this is the case, you may be eligible for additional incentives.  This is applicable to New Vehicles only!  I just need to know who you work for... 
  
Trade-in Vehicles: 
Here's the area where everyone is quite skeptical.  I will give you what I call an Actual Cash Value!(yes, a real #)  I find it much easier to deal with real numbers.  We can talk more about this arena later if you wish. 
  
I will not lose your business over price with anyone!  Bring me a deal from another Ford Dealer and I'll beat it!  If I don't have it in-stock, I'll find it and get here!(New or Pre-Owned)  I HAVE ACCESS TO FORD/LINCOLN/MERCURY PRODUCTS! 
  
Call or email me with a valid phone number if you're interested in discussing more of the details.  I'm available at all times at one of the numbers below.  If for some reason I am not able to get to the phone, just leave me a message and I will return the call shortly.
