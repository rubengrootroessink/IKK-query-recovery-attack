   Hope you are having a good week. I spoke to Liz yesterday - too bad she
   will
   be out of town this weekend! I think she forwarded my email yesterday  -
   Doug's 30th is Friday and Greg Woulfe and I are going to have a happy
   hour
   at the Front Porch Pub (I said back porch yesterday). Hope you can make
   it!
