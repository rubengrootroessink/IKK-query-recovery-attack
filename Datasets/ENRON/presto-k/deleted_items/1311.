PASS ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW 
Someone is sending out a  very cute screensaver of the Budweiser Frogs. 
If you download it, you will lose  everything! Your hard drive will crash 
and someone from the Internet will  get your screen name and password! DO 
NOT DOWNLOAD IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!  
It just went into circulation yesterday. Please distribute  this 
message.This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people know  about 
it. This information was announced yesterday morning from Microsoft.  
Please share it with everyone that might access the  Internet. 
Once again, Pass This Along To EVERYONE in your address  book so that this 
may be stopped. AOL has said that this is a very dangerous  virus and that 
there is NO remedy for it at this time. 
This is VERY important. If you  receive a screen saver from a friend or 
anyone you may not know with the  Budweiser Frogs in it, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT 
OR OPEN THE FILE!
