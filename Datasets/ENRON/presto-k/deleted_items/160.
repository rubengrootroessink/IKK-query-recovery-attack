Good Afternoon-

I am hoping to get your help, based on your extensive experience in the Electric Utility industry.  We are working with some VERY MOTIVATED clients who have opportunities available NOW for experienced professionals from the industry.  The clients are located in various areas across the United States- - East Coast, West Coast and various other attractive locations.

These clients are looking for SUBSTATION ENGINEERS AND DESIGN ENGINEERS.  They need experience with single line drawings and background in elevation, wiring, grounding, bus and equipment layout.  The clients have varied requirements with licences and certifications such as PE, AutoCAD and PLS CAD (Some are requiring these certifications and tools, others are not and may even provide training).

We also have some very motivated clients who are looking for experienced TRANSMISSION LINE DESIGNERS.  They are looking for people with civil experience (tower foundation, wire sagging, spotting and towers), material and technical line specs.  Background with 69kv and above, underground and overhead transmission design.  PLS CAD is a plus, PE not required.

These clients are very motivated and may be willing to look at experience that is slightly dated.  They prefer that the candidate has continued to work in the industry, but they are flexible.

Who do you know that may be able to point me to some of these people?  I would be more than happy to talk to anyone you know.  Thank you in advance for your help.  I look forward to hearing from you.
