The streaks are over for Florida State, and so is another run at the national championship.

Ken Dorsey threw three touchdown passes and No. 2 Miami pulled away with a 28-point third quarter in a dominating 49-27 victory over the Seminoles on Saturday.

The loss ended No. 14 Florida State's 54-game home unbeaten streak as well as its 37-game winning streak at Doak Campbell Stadium dating to 1991, when the Hurricanes beat them 17-16.

"I don't care if the game was played in Alaska, it's just great to beat Florida State," Miami offensive line coach Art Kehoe said. "We'll take a victory against them anywhere we can get it."
