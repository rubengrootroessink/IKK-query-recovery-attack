Kevin,

I have spoken with Elizabeth and Bill and they both said that they will be at your meeting.  I was unable to reach Christi Nicolay however I have left her a voicemail on her cell phone and told her that she was necessary for this meeting.

T Jae,

I will not be here Wednesday morning and did not set up a conference bridge because it is just with Portland.  You might want to arrange something different or contact them yourself.  This conference room (06716) is the one next to John and Louise and it is reserved for you.

Have a Happy New Year!!!

Kim
