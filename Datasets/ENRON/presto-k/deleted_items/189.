- Robinson out.
- Wood done s/t putting location in his offer
- Llodra outstanding: we did not make any of his requested changes.  We sent him the new standard doc with 175/175.  Audrey Martin is talking with him with the objective of explaining why none of his changes were made.  John is showing the new doc to his lawyer and we will discuss Monday. 
- Everyone else is signed (Curry, Cross, Pacheco, Rorschach, Abler, Furrow, Donovan, Valderama, Meyn)

Assuming Llodra is in, we have one hole to fill.  Alternatives to consider:

1. Have Curry give up texas gas and take Texas/SE  Power.
2. Split the world up between Llodra, Curry and Furrow
3. Have Vickers look after SE Power in addition to gas
4. Bring in someone from Enron (Pagan, Wiggs, etc.)
5. ID someone from your trading team to be lead marketer for a region
5. Do nothing and see if a leader emerges
