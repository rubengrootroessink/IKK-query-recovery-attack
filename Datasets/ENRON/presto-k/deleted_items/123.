EXPORT your contacts:
1. Open Outlook and select the contacts folder
2. Click on one of your contacts and then press "CTRL A", this will select all
3. Press FILE / Import and Export ...
4. Choose "EXPORT TO A FILE" and press next
5. Choose "MICROSOFT EXCEL" as the type and press next
6. Make sure "CONTACTS" is selected and press next
7. Choose a location to save the file to: c:\KevinContacts.xls then press next
8. Press FINISH and it will take a minute to copy all contacts to an excel file.

Now you may want to open the excel file to make sure it has something in it, then send it via email to your home.

IMPORT your contacts:
1. Detach the Excel file you got in email.  Save it to your hard drive and remember the location.
2. Open Outlook and choose File/Import and Export ...
3. Choose "Import from another program or file", then press next
4. Select "Microsoft Excel" from the list and press NEXT
5. Choose the file you want to import (The one you detached from email), then press NEXT
	You can also choose whether to allow duplicate entries, in case you have someone in both contact lists.
6. Select the Destination Folder.  Highlight "Contacts" and press NEXT
7. You will see what actions will be completed, press FINISH 

Now Outlook will import the files.


This will work from home and the office.  You can keep doing this every so often, but remember to choose "Do not allow duplicates" in step 5 of the IMPORT phase if you do this more than 1 time.



Good Luck and let me know if you would like me to walk you through this.  

Have a good day.
