Kevin -

As part of Rogers' group over here, I am guessing that most of us are probably on a short list for phase out fairly soon.

I would very much like to apply to the UBS trading company and would like to ask you the best way to go about that.

Will try to find you for a few minutes on Wednesday for any thoughts.

Thanks,
Bobby
