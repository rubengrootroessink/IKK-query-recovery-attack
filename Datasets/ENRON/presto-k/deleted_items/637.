Guys -

FYI - We are on hold with making Berney responsible for all Structuring/Deal Management activities for now.  John is uncomfortable with the dual reporting structure expected by Janet/Dave.  Berney and I sat down with him to discuss and I can surely appreciate his concerns.

In the interim, I think EES will make Deb Merrill head of the traditional Deal Management group.  I am ok with this.  In fact, Berney and I agree that we are still going to send a couple of our resources their way (and maybe get one in return) to help them get up the learning curve.
