I am pleased to announce that the Administrative Committee has accepted the
application of our new regular member effective October 16, 2001:

NRG Energy, Inc.

Indeck-Rockford, LLC is currently a member of MAIN and has been purchased
by NRG.  NRG will survive Indeck-Rockford as the MAIN member.

We look forward to their participation in our activities.  As soon as they
become available, a list of contacts for the various committees will be
added to MAIN's home page.

R. A. Bulley
