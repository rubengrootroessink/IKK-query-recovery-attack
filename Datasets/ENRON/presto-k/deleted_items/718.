Gentlemen -

FYI, We have approximately 3.6 MM Mwh of net sales to New Power Company.  I am not sure what the p/l is but I think it is sizeable as most of these sales were made several months back.  I am not sure if this is on anyone's radar screen but is now on mine.  I will have the group look into p/l.

Rogers
