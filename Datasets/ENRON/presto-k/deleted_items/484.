That would be great.  One thought would be to file it in the docket where w=
e filed on the native load issue, a copy of Ron's testimony. =20

Good idea!  Janine--we will get you Ron McNamara's testimony on behalf AEP =
(SWEPCO in Texas) and see if it will help in Ohio.

Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). =
  AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=
al-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time ener=
gy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio=
.

Can we use their own testimony against them?

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=
tail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony=
 on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=
MI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that =
the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
 market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.
