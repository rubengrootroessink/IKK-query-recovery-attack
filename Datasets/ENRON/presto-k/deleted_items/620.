Kevin -

I will be in Dallas today and will miss our weekly meeting.  Dale has a ver=
y good presentation for the group.  If you would like Berney to attend on m=
y place let him know. =20

Other issues: =20

I left Janet a voice mail y-day on LSE's and she returned it saying she wan=
ted to discuss with me this am and that they have already allocated those L=
SE's to deals.  I have asked Joe to come up with all of our alternatives in=
 order to get additional LSE's and to provide me with detailed reasons why =
we need them.  I don't want to make this into too big of a deal so we will =
assess all options. =20
Site Profile:
Vlady and Woulfie feel that they need to be able to buy/sell shaped swaps t=
o manage their "risk".  I don't think so.  Essentially, they had proposed t=
hat they can look at all commodity deals that get executed and "keep" part =
of the deal for their book.  I told them that this was ludicrous.  They eve=
n indicated that they might want to just buy certain hours for certain mega=
watts.  My position is that 1) they do not need to trade swaps - shaped or =
not - to manage their portfolio as the forecast should always contain their=
 best view of the market and outright swaps would be VAR increasing, 2) onl=
y one desk - the commodity desk - should manage shape, 3) i do not offer sh=
aped products as a tradeable product at this time 4) they already will own/=
manage products that best mitigate their risks and that I would have to buy=
 to cover - DG, Load Curtailment, DSM, etc.  Anyway, I have had several dis=
cussions with them and I think Vlady understands where I am coming from.  I=
n case this comes up you will know my thoughts.

Load Forecasting:  I need to spend some time with Tim, Jeff, Ozzie, Vlady, =
Woulfe, but I really would like to see us roll Retail Load Forecasting (Mik=
e Frazier) into ROC.  Who officially owns ROC (Lloyd?).

I will be available buy cell or pager if you need me.
