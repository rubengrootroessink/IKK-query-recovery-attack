Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.

 

Thanks,

Peggy
