Kevin,

The start time for the Miami vs. West Virginia game on October 25 has been
moved ahead 30 minutes, to a 7:00p.m. kickoff.  If you can't make it out to
the Orange Bowl, the game will be televised on ESPN2.  As always, the
Hurricane Club pre-game end-zone party will start 2 hours prior to kickoff,
at 5:00p.m.

Once again, thanks for your support.

The Hurricane Club
