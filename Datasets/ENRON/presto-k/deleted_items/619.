FYI - I agree with Joe.  Doesn't it make things much more cleaner to have t=
heir projects set up specific LLC LSE's?

The word from Ader was that we can set up LLC LSE's.  This would mean that =
we would set up say EES1, LLC and we would have 3 sub LSE's with that LLC. =
 Why Ader did not go ahead and do this instead of just taking the ones we h=
ad, I have no idea.  In his words, you do not need to change anything on th=
e contracts to account for the LLC being the LSE.  It is all very confusing=
 and I will get to the bottom of it.  If there is not reason to change cont=
ract language, why can't they establish the LLC?  It should not matter to t=
hem.  That was my whole point of the email.

Joe -=20

If we don't get those LSE's what else can we do.  Can we get a separate LSE=
, abandon the one we have, and get our own?  Also, explain to me again all =
of the reasons we need these.

Thanks,
RH

I am not saying that we wear it, I am saying we help them mitigate their ri=
sk.  I have no intention of wearing appropriations risk.  If orig sells it,=
 its theirs.  But from a company perspective, we could hedge it somehow for=
 them and pass any costs on to them.

Also, one more idea for pricing.  I would like to quote the deal at the mid=
, and bury the mid offer into the DSM and othe structures they are doing.  =
That way our energy price looks great and we still keep the mid offer sprea=
d.

1) I like your idea of weighting our bid to gas price moves - we can update=
 them daily on the change.
2) I agree with all but your last suggestion on appropriations.  EES or cre=
dit will have to wear appropriations (as in Central Ohio Schools).  If they=
 want us to wear it they will  not like our price.

Rogers,

I want to run a few ideas past you for the City of Houston.  There are a co=
uple of issues we need to address for the RFP.  I will list them out, give =
you my suggestions and then please comment and send back.

1) The City is asking for a possible 30 day holding period for pricing so t=
hey can get together and vote on the award of the contract
I think we can do one of two things:  we can say pricing is indicative and =
will be set once the bid is awarded.  Or we can say that we will hold price=
s, however, for every X% move in gas our power price will move accordingly,=
 given a stated correlation, and our price will only move up and not down. =
 Or we could do a % move in MW Daily Index, but I think that index can be a=
 poor indicator of forward curve fluctuations.

2) Appropriations Risk - There is not much we can do here except keep it to=
 a one year deal.  However, I am having them look into a possible costless =
collar for the City.  They are, by definition, short going forward and left=
 exposed to higher prices.  If wholesale prices are say 35, we sell them a =
higher priced call and we buy a lower price put at offsetting option premiu=
ms for say cal 03.  That way they can hedge their risk costlessly.  The wor=
st case scenarios for them are 1) they buy say $40 power (if that is the ca=
ll strike), or 2) they buy $30 power (if that is our put strike).  If I was=
 a city, this is what I would do to hedge if I could not do a longer term d=
eal.  There are some issues here though.  If they do not get appropriated t=
he money, we might not be able to exercise our put.  If EES management deci=
des they are comfortable with appropriations risk, I think an option premiu=
m is better risk than out right hedging against a possible phantom position=
.  Second alternative is that we can sell the fixed retail gen past the app=
ropriations date and we, as a desk, can collar it to hedge out our marked t=
o market risk.  This of course would only hedge our wholesale risk but that=
 should be about 80-90% of the risk.

Right now these are the major issues facing the desk on this deal.  Please =
let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.  By the way, you missed a good dinner l=
ast night.  Lavo was hilarious.

-Joe
