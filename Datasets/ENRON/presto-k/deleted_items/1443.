Group Developing "SeTrans RTO" Files Status Report at
FERC; Entergy Joins SeTrans Process

New Orleans, La. - The Entergy Operating Companies have
joined in the effort to develop the proposed Southeast
RTO, SeTrans. Today, the group of transmission systems
developing the SeTrans RTO filed a status report with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to update it
on the progress of the RTO formation and to advise it that
Entergy has joined the group of companies forming the RTO.
The companies proposing to form the SeTrans RTO are
Entergy, Southern Company, City of Dalton Utilities, MEAG
Power, South Mississippi Electric Power Association, City
of Tallahassee, JEA, Santee Cooper, and the Georgia
Transmission Corporation.

The proposed RTO, named SeTrans Grid Company, was recently
expanded to include Entergy as a participating
transmission owner. Once it becomes operational, SeTrans
will be one of the nation's largest RTOs with more than
73,000 MW's of generation, 51,000 miles of transmission,
representing a transmission investment in excess of $9
billion.

This filing is the latest step in a process that began in
June when owners of transmission systems across Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina signed a
memorandum of understanding to form an RTO for the
Southeast. While the filing today will outline the initial
proposed structure of the RTO, Entergy intends to work
with the Arkansas Public Service Commission, the Louisiana
Public Service Commission, the Mississippi Public Service
Commission, the New Orleans City Council, and the Public
Utilities Commission of Texas and the operating companies'
other retail regulators to address concerns that they may
have with the proposed RTO.

"We believe that the SeTrans model, as it has evolved, is
the best platform to achieve the mutual goals of the
various involved companies. The structure of the SeTrans
RTO partnership will be of significant size and scope. The
SeTrans RTO structure is consistent with the structure
that Entergy was pursuing with the Southwest Power Pool,
but in a region that is more reflective of our actual
market activity," said Frank Gallaher, president fossil
operations and transmission for Entergy.

The structure chosen by the participating transmission
owners will involve hiring a proven independent operator
for the transmission system. The agreements between the
operator and transmission owners will provide incentives
to the operator to maintain or enhance reliability,
minimize the cost of the operation of the system and
enhance the efficient use of the system. A detailed
description of the proposed governance structure of
SeTrans, the proposed role of stakeholders in the
selection of the independent third party operator, and the
ongoing role of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee are all
described in today's filing.

Beginning in June, the City of Dalton (Ga.) Utilities,
City of Tallahassee (Fla.) Georgia Transmission
Corporation, JEA -- Jacksonville (Fla.), the Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia; Santee Cooper (S.C.),
Southern Company and South Mississippi Electric Power
Association have been working on the formation of a
regional transmission organization for the Southeastern
United States.

SeTrans will hold a "Stakeholder Meeting" in Mid-January,
2002, in Atlanta, Georgia to establish a stakeholder
advisory committee. Details on the meeting's registration
process, agenda and map to the meeting will be posted on
the SeTrans web site, www.setransgrid.com.
