Kevin,

This is the schedule for the Stanford Trip.  Leaving on Thursday at 10:55 am arrives La Guardia at 3:04 pm .  On Saturday the return 
flight will leave LaGuardia at 10:30 am arriving Houston at 1:15 or so.  This is the schedule Tammie Schoppe has given me as soon as she
gets an itinerary she will send it to us.

Thank you
