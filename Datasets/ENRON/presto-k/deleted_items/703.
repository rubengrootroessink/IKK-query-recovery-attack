Performance Management for Electric Distribution Companies
An  Executive Forum
October 25-26, 2001, Atlanta,  GA

 

OVERVIEW

 
Deregulation is introducing competition into the  electric utility industry in an ever-increasing rate, and it is requiring  companies to consider dramatic changes in their business processes, in the  operation of their businesses, and in managing their assets.  Issues such as customer satisfaction,  performance based rates, operational reliability targets, operational  efficiencies, risk management, and rate reductions are among the new business  drivers.
 
With the advent of new choices open to the smallest  retail customers as well as the largest industrials, distribution companies are  re-engineering their businesses and re-establishing their corporate priorities  in response to these new challenges.   This new business environment has brought performance management to the  forefront for the electric distribution companies, and they are being driven by  regulators, customers, and financial rating agencies to improve all aspects of  their performance.   
 
Through this conference, we have gathered leading  executives from distribution companies, wires companies, generation companies,  energy marketers, regulators, and market participants to openly discuss the  issues, their experiences, and their corporate strategies.  Our objective for this executive forum  is to provide you with new insights into how electric distribution companies are  addressing these issues and concerns, and to help you formulate your own  corporate approach to this challenging and complex new world.

Ancillary Services Conference
October 31-November 2, 2001, Denver,  CO

 

OVERVIEW

 
The Ancillary Services  conference will explore the rapidly changing and fascinating engineering,  economic, market, and policy issues related to bulk-power ancillary services.  These issues are difficult to resolve because these services are essential for  both reliability and commerce, and it is often difficult to disentangle the  two.
 
Topics to be covered at this  event include centralized vs. supplier unit commitment, integration of  ancillary-service markets with energy and congestion markets, relationships  among forward and real-time markets, measuring the performance of  ancillary-service delivery, operating costs to provide these services,  retail-load provision of some ancillary services, comparisons among the existing  ISOs and future RTOs in their treatment of ancillary services, and the  feasibility of letting price influence the amount of reserves  acquired.
 
Electric Utility Consultants,  Inc., a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric  industry, has assembled a covey of top experts to explore all aspects of the  emerging field in a conference devoted exclusively to Ancillary Services.

Performance-Based  Ratemaking Conference
December  5-7, 2001, Denver, CO
 
OVERVIEW
 

Performance  Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the  electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully  and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the  shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in  achieving efficiency and service quality.
 
EUCI  has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR  developments and applications.  Join  us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you  will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your  company.

Electric  Power Market Performance Conference
December  12-14, 2001, Denver, CO
 
OVERVIEW
 

Each  year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity  market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are  leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern  Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons  to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market  design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and  implementing a market based congestion management system in the  midwest.
 
A  second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New  York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being  pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address  inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for  transmission expansion.
 
Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.
