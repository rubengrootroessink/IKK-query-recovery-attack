Kevin -

Just want to double check that Harry has declined the contract and offer letter from UBS.  

I have a letter that David handed over which states he was declining the contract, but wanted to remain an employee at will.

Sorry for double checking, but just wanted to close the loop.

Thanks!
Amy
