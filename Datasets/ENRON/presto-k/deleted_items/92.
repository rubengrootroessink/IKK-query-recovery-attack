E] It seems evident that Anderson, the government  and Enron itself, had pr=
ivy to a lot of financial data that clearly  indicated the eventual collaps=
e of Enron.   Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one  =
year ago because of concerns due to Enron's accounting methodology.   The W=
hite House oversaw a study in October 2001 of economic  repercussions of an=
 Enron collapse. Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron Executive, wrote to Enron'=
s  chairman, Ken Lay, "I am incredibly nervous that we will  implode in a w=
ave of accounting scandals." last August 2001" The writing was clearly on t=
he wall but most were unable to react  to the intelligence. It all comes do=
wn to the lemming factor;  we can see the cliff but just cannot avoid jumpi=
ng.    Many in the industry suffer badly from the chronic inability  to rea=
ct in a timely manner. This failure often results in severe  negative econo=
mic impacts. Either policy is not in place to allow  affirmative reaction o=
r staff does not adhere to the policies  that exist.   Good corporate polic=

=09=09   About ZE PowerGroup   [IMAGE] [IMAGE] ZE PowerGroup is a strategic=
 consulting firm  that was incorporated to serve the emerging needs of an e=
lectric  industry in transition. Our company now offers a full spectrum of =
 services, from strategic planning and implementation through to  technical=
 analysis and energy trade and transaction software development. [IMAGE]   =
[IMAGE] =09[IMAGE]=09=09[IMAGE]=09
[IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=09their accounting practices to be "c=
reative and  aggressive" while their clients claim that there actions were =
"not  unethical", with apparent stress on the "not" part. One  now battered=
 marketer has been specifically accused of "suspending  the rules of corpor=
ate ethics and perhaps even put corporate morality  on vacation".    Words =
like scandal, allegations, suspicions and cover-up have become  rank in the=
 industry. CEOs have been asked to leave their positions,  executives have =
been forcibly terminated while another commits suicide;  and the investigat=
ions continue, including criminal ones. The situation  is sobering.  It see=
ms like these last few years have been full of bubbles bursting  as we all =
collectively share a cold bath of economic reality. The techs  tumbled and =
the stock markets followed, the electricity market (at least  in California=
) imploded, real bombs are exploding all over the place  and the mightiest =
energy marketer has fallen; and it won't be getting  back up. The biggest b=
ankruptcy in US history will definitely leave  its mark on all of us. To th=
ink, we thought the troubles of PG&E  and the Cal-PX was big news.   Arthur=
 Levitt, former SEC boss, suggests that "Enron's collapse  did not occur in=
 a vacuum ? (and was) ? was partly a result  of a culture of gamesmanship a=
mong go-go businesses that believe it's  okay to bend the rules". This is a=
 fundamental folly of the industry  as people with limited energy knowledge=
 (and integrity) play games with  other peoples money and not understanding=
 or caring about the consequences.  It is not surprising that the stock val=
ue of other marketers is also  beginning to plummet.  So the question of th=
e day is: are you acting prudently? It is insufficient  to assume that migh=
t is right or size is protection. Contracting with  the largest does not se=
cure your contract; no more than using the largest  accounting firm ensures=
 your books are right. We all leave a paper trail  and that trail is visibl=
e in a moonless night during a California forced  blackout, even if you ord=
er your accounting firm to delete the emails  and shred the "evidence".  In=
 working with our clients, we have come to see that information does  not r=
eceive its due respect. Perhaps it's the fault of the Internet  and the inf=
ormation overload factor, but not respecting information  is costly. We hav=
e witnessed "lost deals" and poor follow-up.  We have seen the cost of not =
rigorously following corporate trade, risk  credit procedures and surely we=
 have seen the result of blind faith  in the big guys. To this end we activ=
ely support our clients to equip  themselves to effectively manage large am=
ounts of market information.    Energy market participants, more so than pe=
rhaps other industries,  must heed the requirement for prudence. For many p=
rudence is a forgotten  tradition from the franchise days. Prudence in comp=
etitive markets,  which all energy markets are to some degree, means a lot =
more now than  it did in the franchise era. We are all under the purvey of =
the public,  the investor and the regulators. Not to recognize this fact ca=
n have  severe economic ramifications. Prudence now means having trade, ris=
k  and credit policies and procedures, having the tools to manage and analy=
ze  data and foremost, developing the ability to internally make the right =
 judgment calls.  Call us to see how ZE PowerGroup can help your organizati=
on to manage  its operation in uncertain markets.  For more information vis=
