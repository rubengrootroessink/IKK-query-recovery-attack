   Could you meet with the son of a client on the captioned item?  He'll be
   here the week of Feb 11th; I'm out of town.  I

   don't yet know the dates.  He is Eric Fabrikant, son of Charles, Chrm &
   CEO of Seacor Smit (NYSE: CKH).

   Eric wants to be in the Energy business and is meeting several exec's
   that week.  Yes, you could be one.  I would

   appreciate your help.

   Best regards,
