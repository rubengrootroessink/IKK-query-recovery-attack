Jurisdictional Disputes Intensify
As FERC Seeks to Extend Its Authority=20

[News item from Dow Jones] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (F=
ERC) kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r=
ules requiring utilities to turn control of their power-grid assets to inde=
pendent management. The controversial effort to carve up the nation's elect=
ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTOs) is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. The workshop=
s, dubbed "RTO Week," were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls "buy in=
" for the effort, which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie=
s, state regulators and members of Congress.=20

Analysis: The objective of this week's workshops may be to gain support fro=
m the industry for FERC's controversial mandate, but they are also having t=
he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERC's jurisdic=
tional boundaries. The issue has become rather evenly divided. On one side,=
 critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order, which=
 as noted has become somewhat of a "cause c?l?bre" for new Chairman Wood. O=
n the other hand, supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis=
sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s=
uppliers into the nation's transmission system. By Wood's own directive, th=
e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh=
at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin=
g point, as a Dec. 15 deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u=
tilities is fast approaching.=20

Certainly, the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman (after replacing Curt H=
?bert last month) has signaled a new era for the federal commission, which =
oversees much of the energy industry's wholesale market and the nation's po=
wer grid. As noted, Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key =
objectives. Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int=
erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec. 15, by which time transmis=
sion-owning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join=
 an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities. Using what he has =
referred to as a "big stick," Wood warned that failing to comply with the D=
ec. 15 deadline would cost transmission-owning utilities their right to cha=
rge market-based rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in =
which the utilities might become engaged.=20

This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand, but has also sparked an inte=
nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul=
ating energy market. Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints=
 on FERC's authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional =
leaders, who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi=
tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers. State regulators, p=
articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ=
ely low, argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is. S=
uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight (rather than c=
ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC), and also believe t=
hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n=
ation's transmission system is managed. Also in question is the extent to w=
hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners=
 if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen=
d state boundaries.=20

Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERC's authority to force =
it to participate in an RTO. In its July order, FERC directed Southern Comp=
any (along with the Southwest Power Pool, Entergy Corp. and Grid South) to =
form a single RTO for the Southeast region, most likely adopting a structur=
e modeled after Grid South. However, Southern Company already has sunk abou=
t $3 billion into its own 26,000-mile system, over which it wants to retain=
 independent control.=20

FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan=
t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e=
lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced. However,=
 Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co=
uld run as high as $100 million, which could be passed on to customers in t=
he form of higher rates. Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph=
ical point of view and questions whether or not the commission's vision of =
four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient. On=
e of Southern's concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la=
rge and end up operating like monopolies. Ironically, the issue has caused =
dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant, which as an i=
ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid. Whil=
e Southern disagrees with FERC's authority to force RTO participation, Mira=
nt supports the federal government's efforts to streamline transmission act=
ivity.=20

Leaders of RTO West-the transmission entity in which FERC wants to include =
the transmission assets of states in the Northwest, Southwest and Californi=
a-also question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC=
's authority to mandate this structure. Leaders in the region have said tha=
t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates, con=
sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity =
to meet high demand in the area. In other words, although FERC may be endor=
sing market-based rates for those transmission-owning utilities that join R=
TOs, some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre=
ased activity.=20

Nevertheless, along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D=
ynegy and Enron, which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities=
 and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems. Hence, t=
hese companies agree with FERC's emphasis on RTO formations, as generation =
companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f=
rom utilities to independent management companies.=20

In addition to the RTO issue, the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas & E=
lectric Co. have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio=
nal authority to a head. The utility's parent PG&E Corp. is pursuing a "rin=
g fencing" strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi=
ngs of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Put simply, PG&E Corp. is trying to prote=
ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new, federally regulat=
ed subsidiary. The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca=
use the California Public Utility Commission, which presently regulates the=
 utility operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., believes that it has the=
 right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary. Further, th=
e state government in California believes that PG&E Corp.'s plan would give=
 too much regulatory control to FERC, and by the same token reduce the amou=
nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr=
esently contained in a regulated subsidiary.=20

The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend=
 its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder=
al legal system. In fact, last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen=
ts from federal lawyers, state regulators and private industry, addressing =
not only FERC's authority to mandate RTOs but also the commission's 1996 or=
der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s=
ystems. Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe=
deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat=
ion in an RTO. At present, the commission had danced around the issue by ca=
lling for "voluntary" participation, yet still affixing stiff penalties for=
 utilities that refuse to comply.=20

In addition, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the Energy and Air Qual=
ity Subcommittee, is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b=
ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session (which cou=
ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl=
y November). Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs, and his draft bill repor=
tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr=
ivate utilities that own power lines. At the same time, however, it is beli=
eved that Barton's draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi=
ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERC's order, which again w=
ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on =
transmission issues.=20

Moreover, Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d=
ebate over FERC's authority as disputes between state and federal regulator=
y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge. Howe=
ver, given FERC's deadline of Dec. 15 for RTO participation, the issue has =
gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in =
their heels and rebuff the federal commission's mandate.=20
