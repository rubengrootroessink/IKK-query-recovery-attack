Just FYI.  They're cleaning up their slop (he's long an odd 20MW block).  I told him no offer on the odd block.

Kevin,

Any interest if offering an odd block of 30MW, into SOCO, 5x16, Cal'02.  Duke Energy is asking?  I told him it would be at a premium to our EOL offer for the odd block, if we would sell it at all.
