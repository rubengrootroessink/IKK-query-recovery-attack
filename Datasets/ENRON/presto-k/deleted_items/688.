Tamara,

A collegue in the Houston office forwarded on a message from Kevin that I should contact you to set up some telephone interviews with the following people;

Kevin Presto (VP - head of East Power Trading)
Fletcher Sturm (VP - head of midwest trading - East Power)
Dana Davis (VP - head of northeast trading - East Power).

Could you let me know a possible schedule? I'm available anytime this week, including any evening (London time) calls.

Many thanks, 

Tim
