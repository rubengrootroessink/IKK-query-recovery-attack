ERCOT is obligated to perform weather sensitivity analysis on all IDR ESI IDs according to section 11.3.3.1 of the Protocols.  The weather responsiveness determination process establishes the proxy-day selection methodology that will be used to estimate consumption when IDR ESI IDs do not have meter data available for settlement.  This email is to notify market participants that this analysis has been completed as prescribed in the Protocols.  
 
ERCOT has modified the original process such that the analysis only produces a report identifying IDR ESI IDs that are weather sensitive.  These reports have been generated and they will be forwarded to the appropriate TDSPs and the LSEs.  The TDSP is responsible for submitting 814_20 EDI transactions corresponding to the most current meter read date to change the Profile IDs that have been determined to be weather sensitive. This process should begin immediately. The portion of the report being provided to the LSE is for informational purposes only. 
 
ERCOT will establish a mechanism to ensure the TDSPs have completed the process of updating the Profile ID changes.  TDSPs should complete changes to Profile IDs no later than the end of March 2002.   Since ERCOT manually maintains ESI IDs for NOIE wholesale delivery points, ERCOT will perform the Profile ID changes for NOIE ESI IDs.
 
TDSPs must continue to assign a non-weather sensitive (NWS) Profile ID to any new ESI IDs.  IDR ESI IDs determined to be weather sensitive by ERCOT shall remain weather sensitive (WS) until such time as ERCOT notifies the TDSP otherwise.  
 
ERCOT will perform the annual weather sensitivity analysis again in November of 2002 based upon 2002 meter data and weather data and provide reports to TDSPs and LSEs for any changes to Profile IDs. 
 
If you have any further questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.
