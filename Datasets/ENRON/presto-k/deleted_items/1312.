I'd like to share something with you.  I have  included a link of the manufacturer's pricing to the Dealer-by Kelley Blue  Book.(New or Pre-Owned)  This will show you that my integrity is  sincere.(click below)  There's no need to run all over town shopping for a  vehicle.  You just drive to the person who shows you the real  numbers.(Me)  By attaching the dealer cost values for you, it is obvious  that you are getting a fair deal.(Wholesale Price)  At the same time, you  are saving time and money.  I'll try to make this as easy as possible  folks.  If you are not ready at this time, that's okay!   This is  not a high pressure car buying program.  What I do ask of you is that you  WRITE DOWN & REMEMBER who got you all of the pertinent information to make  your car buying decision.(Ken Finney)  See below..
 
Some of you don't know it yet, but your company may  be a partner with Ford.  If this is the case, you may be eligible for  additional incentives.  This is applicable to New Vehicles only!  I  just need to know who you work for...
 
Trade-in Vehicles:
Here's the area where everyone is quite  skeptical.  I will give you what I call an Actual Cash Value!(yes, a real  #)  I find it much easier to deal with real numbers.  We can talk more  about this arena later if you wish.
 
I will not lose your business over price with  anyone!  Bring me a deal from another Ford Dealer and I'll beat it!   If I don't have it in-stock, I'll find it and get here!(New or  Pre-Owned)  I HAVE ACCESS TO FORD/LINCOLN/MERCURY PRODUCTS!
 
Call or email me with a valid phone number if  you're interested in discussing more of the details.  I'm on the road a lot  so please leave messages on my cell phone or with another Sales  Manager.
