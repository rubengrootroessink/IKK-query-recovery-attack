If you go out to the NRC website now, you will find this message posted:

"Our site is not operational at this time. In the aftermath of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken the
action to shut down its web site. In support of our mission to protect
public health and safety, we are performing a review of all material on our
site. We appreciate your patience and understanding during these difficult
times."

What this means for today is that we will be unable to provide a normal
Daily Recap Report since our analysis is based on the current day's status
of operation for the plants.  We will, however, attempt to organize our
contacts so that we can simulate a regular reporting of plant status and
produce an analysis and projection from that.

We anticipate that the NRC website will be operational again next week and
will hopefully be back to normal as far as our interface with it.

We will keep you posted on any additional developments.

Dan
