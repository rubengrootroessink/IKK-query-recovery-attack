Yeah, general catch up - no big deal.  We can do it anytime.

I need to leave at 3:30 today to go to my stepson's football game.   Unfortunately, I have a 2:00 and 3:00 meeting already.   Is this just a general catch-up discussion?

Kevin -

Instead of our weekly update meeting, would you like to meet with Belden at 4:00 in your office?
