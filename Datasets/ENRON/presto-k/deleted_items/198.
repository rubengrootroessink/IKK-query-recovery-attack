Dana,

I met with Kevin last night to discuss a possible opportunity within your team.  We agreed that you and I should meet to discuss that interest.  I have done extensive work with EWS Retail Risk Mgmt on managing the New York retail-portfolio, amongst other things that I'll be happy to talk to you about.

Let us talk at your convenience.  Thanks.

Juan
