Leslie, Jim:

We will need the following information to complete the transmission provider applications, ISO agreements, and NERC memberships.  

- Billing Contact including address, number, email etc.  
- Customer Contact including address, number, email etc.  (We recommend Corry Bentley for the East, however need to confirm address)
- Routing numbers, billing fax numbers
- UBS AG DUNS number
- Confirm what company name to be utilized for the Transmission Provider, ISO and NERC Regional Reliability Council agreements/memberships.

Leslie, can you assist in helping us finalize the above information.  We would like to begin mailing in the TP, ISO & NERC agreements next week on the 12th. 

In regards to NERC ETAG and NERC business entity, we would like to register as UBS.  If we register as UBSWE it may get confused with the East and West scheduling desks.  Therefore, we would like to use the following initials for the NERC scheduling desk codes: UBSE (east desk), UBSW (west desk), UBSC (canada).   I will coordinate this with the West and Canada desks this week, in addition to other remaining steps such as registration with Tradewave for JTSIN OASIS etc.  

Debra

Conversion Map for Website Contents

Based on the above Names Summary, the following map should apply. If you see any specific instances in which applying this map would result in a questionable result, please see me and I will try to clarify the appropriate treatment.

"Enron Corp" -> "UBS AG"
"Enron North America" -> "UBS AG" on Masters, GTC's, ETA, PA ONLY
"Enron North America" -> "UBS AG, London Branch" on Product Descriptions
"EnronOnline" -> "UBSWenergy"
