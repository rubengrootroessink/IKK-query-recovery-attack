Rika,
Just to let you know a couple of things:
1. The NRC (Chairman Meserve's executive assistant) called us specifically =
today to let us know the daily plant status was back.  However, they said t=
hey are still in a test mode and the data may not all be there and what's t=
here may not all be accurate.  They are still working toward having everyth=
ing up and rolling perfect by the end of the month (although it seems they =
will improve on that target).

2. The Indian Point 2 meeting was about what we expected.  The NRC has a li=
ttle more confidence in the way Entergy is proceeding than it had in Con Ed=
ison.  However, IP2 remains the only plant in the country with multiple deg=
raded cornerstones in the NRC's reactor oversight process, and is still wea=
k in several of those areas including: Design Configuration Control, Human =
Performance, Equipment Reliability, Emergency Preparedness, and Corrective =
Actions.  One of the major disadvantages that Entergy has with IP2 is its l=
ocation in the Northeast (Anti-nuke country).  There were more than 120 peo=
ple at the meeting, of which about half were general public.  The public wa=
s not friendly and voiced complaints and protests against the quality of op=
eration.  While this of itself will not hurt Entergy's operation efforts, i=
t does bear heavily on the NRC's attitude toward the plant.  The NRC does n=
ot want to be embarrassed as it has in the past (most notably with Millston=
e).  If Entergy loses ground in their recovery efforts especially in the ar=
ea of security, the NRC will step in to take more drastic action.
