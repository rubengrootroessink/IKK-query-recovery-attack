TECO is issuing an RFP to sell up to 500MW beginning June 1, 2004.  TECO is converting its coal-fired Gannon facility into a gas-fired, combined-cycle plant (to be Bayside Facility).  It will be a 4 unit plant.  They are selling cap. and energy off of units 3 & 4, which have combined output of 960MW using 7FA turbines.  At full load, the net plant heat rate is 7,100.  

I should receive the RFP shortly.  They are looking to sell a toll off of the plant.
