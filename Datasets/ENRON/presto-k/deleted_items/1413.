Dear Kevin,

What a game on Saturday!  While we all expected Miami to pull out a victory,
who would have expected 59-0!  If you haven't already seen the newest BCS
rankings, the Hurricanes are still #2 but now farther ahead of Oklahoma.  As
long as we beat Washington and Virginia Tech, we should be Rose Bowl bound!
Our victory over Syracuse wrapped up at least a share of the Big East
Championship, so at the very least we are guaranteed an Orange Bowl birth.

Concerning bowl game tickets:
A few decisions have been made concerning bowl game tickets.  As a 2001
member of the Hurricane Club, you are at the front of the line for bowl
tickets!  The Bowl Ticket Order Deadline is slated for December 12 - all
orders MUST be in by this point.  The ticket office will be prepared to
accept bowl ticket order beginning Monday, December 3.  Just call
1-800-GO-CANES to order tickets.  We expect the phone lines to be very busy,
so please be patient - you will be taken care of!

Your donor level will determine the amount of priority tickets you will be
able to purchase: Cane Club ($150) donors will be able to buy 2 priority
tickets, Orange ($250) and Green ($500) Club members will be able to buy 4
priority tickets, Coaches ($1000), Commissioner's ($1,500), and Director's
($2,500) Club members will be able to buy 6 priority tickets, Silver Canes
($5,000) will be able to buy 8 priority tickets, and Living Scholars and
Golden Canes ($10,000+) will be able to buy 10 priority tickets.  Priority
tickets will be the first of our allotment assigned, and will thus be in the
best locations.

If you'd like to purchase additional tickets, you have the option to buy up
to 20 tickets.  The additional tickets, though, will not be priority level.
For instance, if a member of the Cane Club wanted to buy 10 tickets, the
first 2 would be priority tickets and be in the best seat location possible.
The additional 8 will be allocated to the ticket buyer after all other
Hurricane Club members have gotten their priority tickets.  All 10 seats
would then not be in the same location, unless you specifically request to
move your priority seats to be next to your additional seats.

More information will follow shortly, as soon as we have it.  If you have
any questions concerning bowl tickets or travel, please call Zach Goines at
305-284-6699 or just respond to this email.

Hope to see you all at the Washington game this weekend.  On behalf of the
entire Hurricane Club staff, have great Thanksgiving holiday!
