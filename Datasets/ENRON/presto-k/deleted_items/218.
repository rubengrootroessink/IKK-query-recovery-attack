> (Valley Forge, PA and Carmel, IN - January 21, 2002) PJM Interconnection and

> wholesale market for electricity producers and consumers in all or parts of 27
> Midwest and mid-Atlantic states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian
> province of Manitoba.
>
> 	The vision for achieving a single energy market is outlined in the
> Letter of Intent, which officials at PJM and MISO discussed with their
> respective members and boards last week.
>
> 	"This Letter of Intent reflects PJM and MISO's commitment to develop a
> single, robust energy market that meets the needs of all customers and
> stakeholders in the combined region," said Phillip G. Harris, PJM president
> and chief executive officer. "PJM and MISO's intent is to offer an innovative

> encompassed by the market."

> organizations with certain functions undertaken jointly and others undertaken
> through common processes,
> *
> *	The needs of the states, district and province, individually and
> collectively, will be integral to a successful solution,
> *
> *	Appropriate information technology network architectural design will be
> established that will provide for growth, redundancy, security and flexibility
> for the future, and
>
> *	A commitment to an open process to advise on the development of the
> market design by immediately establishing a joint stakeholder market
> committee.

> million square miles including all or portions of:
