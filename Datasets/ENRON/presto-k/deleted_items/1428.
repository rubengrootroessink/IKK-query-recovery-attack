**A customer must provide a complete, system generated Good Faith
Estimate, listing a specific lender's name, that is dated the same
day as the rate quoted by us. If such Good Faith Estimate indicates a
lower interest rate than  our rate, inclusive of points and loan
fees, for the same loan program that is offered by us and we have 
verified the accuracy of the rate and fees listed then we will have 
the option of beating that lender's total loan costs by $100 or 
paying the customer $250 ($500 for properties located in California) 
when they close with that lender and provide us with a copy of the 
signed Note and Final HUD-1 Settlement Statement.
