Kevin,

If you are okay with it I would like to take tomorrow and Monday off?  Your schedule is open so let me know what you think.  

Also, I am getting a cost for Doug Gilbert-Smith to take the four traders and their spouses to Barton Creek, so I will keep you posted on that as well.  On that same note, the Scheduling Group and I will be leaving next Friday, Oct. 26th to Cancun and we will be back in the office on Oct. 29th.  Remember to keep me posted about the San Antonio deal for the VP's.

One last thing...would you be available to do a lunch meeting in your office on Tues. at 11:30am with Dave Duran, Tina Rode and myself?  We would like to get yours and Dave's impute on some future things for the girls, Tina and myself.

Thanks again,

T.Jae
