Southern is evaluting the 7x24 offer from the Wansley delivery point.  They indicated hesitance to offer LD, but are more amenable to offer LD if have choice of delivery points.  I indicated we had the preference of Wansley, but would also consider Scherer.  I'll let you know what they come back with.
