The curves for NY G and NY J offpeak and onpeak were updated by rob benson as a result of the email that was sent out the other day. He is still working on updating the curves. The changes that he made on friday are the first of the changes.
I have asked Jeff Jackson to move the curve change impact (-$1.275million) into the "change deal" section of the P&L. Let me know if that is incorrect.
