No problem.   The only problem right now is ENE's stock price.   Wow - you get em.

Kevin -

I was requested by Prof Webb to participate in an Energy Panel Discussion at UVA and have agreed.  Some of our competitors will be there and this will hopefully further our recruiting efforts.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Thanks,
Rogers
