Fundamentals of the weather for the next 10-14 days remain the same as last
week. The MRF and especially European models have been the most consistent
lately. I am following the Euro here, but the MRF and Euro are not that much
different and share the following....

1) A change to much cooler weather than recently begininng this week.
Weather pattern will become stormier and cooler overall, and we will see
some daily variability as storms cross the nation.

2) No major Arctic air intrusions through the balance of the month and
probably very early Dec.

3) Snowcover remains minimal in Southern Canada and in the U.S. This will be
changing somewhat over the next couple of weeks.

4) I have no changes to the far long term for early to mid December. There
is reason to believe that the upcoming pattern will last for a period of
time, then change again. When it changes, there is a greater probability
than not of it shifting to even colder for the East. It will be our
challenge for the next couple of weeks to determine timing and intensity of
this change.

5) Tomorrow's 6 to 10 day and 11 to 15 day forecasts hitting the market
should be neutral to bearish overall, but certainly not as warm / mild as
recent weeks.
