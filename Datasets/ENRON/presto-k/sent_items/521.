I can speak with Chris Ahn when he gets back from his honeymoon.

Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.  Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefits of joining this effort?

The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management process from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the senior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findings.

This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be appreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help.  


Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is leaning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (and also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.

Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring and was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walking away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almost ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definitely someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.
