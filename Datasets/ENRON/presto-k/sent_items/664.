I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets.    NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh.   I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.

Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.

Thanks.

Kevin -

This is the feedback we are getting on business in MA.  Honestly, I do not think we have won a deal of size up there in over 30 days.  We have reviewed our curves and feel they are very reasonable.  I will continue to investigate.

Also, reviewing recent losses - most keep coming from NE markets across the board.  We continued to get hit last Thurs and Fri.  It appears the changes there are much more rout of sync with the rest of the markets and extreme.  Are you following these moves for reasonableness and to make sure they are not just favorable to the underlying positions.  I just don't want to "negotiate" from in the whole.

If AES and SEL are offering deals like outlined below, maybe we can have them assume some of our load at a profit.

Due to problems on the J: Drive we are currently working on trying to restore the database that contained Lost/Closed Deals.  Attached is the last Lost/Closed Deal report.  Please note that we did not loose nor win any deals on Friday August 17.  However, we did loose a deal today:

Originator:		Malcolm Ticknor
Company Name:	 Wyman Gordon
Competitor:		 AESNewEnergy 
Competitor's Offer:	$51.95/ MWh.  for 12 months
EES Offer:		$56.3 which included $3 margin.  
Desk Offer:		$53.26
Spend:			38,000 MWh/year.

Hopefully the database will be back up tomorrow, and you will be able to see the report as usual.
