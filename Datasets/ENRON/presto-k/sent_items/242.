Please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports:

Remove ERCOT wind position completely from the report (PPA has been terminated)
Add ERCOT north zone positions
Add ERCOT south zone positions
Show separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC
Add PJM-East positions (show separate from PJM-West)
Off-Peak position still shows SERC-FL (this location no longer exists) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC.

Thanks.
