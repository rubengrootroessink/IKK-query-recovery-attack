For the 25th presentation, I need the following:

A pictorial description of power generation sources:	1) Nuclear
							2) Coal
							3) Resid Steam Unit
							3) Gas Combined Cycle
							4) Gas Simple Cycle
							5) Hydro

I would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.   A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.   In addition, total capability by supply source

Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton.
