Several names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform.   The names that did not transfer have text next to them.   For exampe, Todd Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it.

There are several other examples of this.

thanks.
