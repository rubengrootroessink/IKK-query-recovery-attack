Resume looks impressive.   We should definitely interview him.   I forwarded e-mail to Louise to see if she knows the guy from her London gas trading days.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John
