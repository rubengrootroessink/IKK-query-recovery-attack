The pricing information on the website is fine.

Rika,

I am working on the Natural Gas derivatives desk. I would like access to all the individual modules in the east power fundamentals website. I particularly need the meta stock historical prices. Mike Symms told me that you were the person to speak to. I would appreciate any help you can give me. If you need a reference, please talk to Harry Arora.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
