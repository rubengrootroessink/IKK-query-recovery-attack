Kevin,
 
  I didn't get the chance to say goodbye or  good luck since you were not at your desk. I just wanted to thank you for giving  me the chance to work at Enron, which is (was) a special place with unique and  talented people. Your insights , management style and market  intelligence are second to none in the trading community. I hope you can keep  your core group together and not be smothered by another organization that can  only think "inside the box". Good luck.
 
  Regards, 
                  Joe Quenet.
 
PS Tell Dave Ryan to take me off the distribution  list for European evening updates. I don't really care about that stuff anymore.
