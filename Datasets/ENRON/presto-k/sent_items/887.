Kevin,

Attached below is a comprehensive spreadsheet of all 76 plants and their status.  Currently our areas of concentration are the June testing/start dates (55 plants).  We are continuing to monitor and update information as received. Please review and if you have any questions feel free to contact me (3-9844) or Kristin Walsh (3-9510).

The Legend for the spreadsheet is as follows:  RED type-new information
					          BLACK type - May information
					          BLUE type - June and forward information

Kelly
