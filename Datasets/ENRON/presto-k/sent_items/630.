Kevin,
 
Rick Shapiro asked me to return to Govt. Affairs in February to help manage the fallout from the CA energy crisis.  We've got teams targeted at CA, the western states, New York and Washington, DC.
 
There's a lot going on in NY right now, and the new Executive Director of IPPNY really needs to get up to speed with marketing/trading issues directly related to NY.  I think Tom - if he has time - could really be helpful to us in this situation.  He knows how the market trades in NY, the impacts of price caps/penalties, the behavior of the utilities, etc. 
 
I only need one day of his time.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Kevin/Dana,
 
Do either of you have any concerns with me helping Janel out with this?
 
Tom

Tom.....per our discussion a few weeks ago.  I was wondering if you would be interested in going to NY with me to "educate" a few people on the NY power trading market?  The person who needs the most educating is Gavin Donohue, Executive Director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, who is out there talking with the press and regulators about the RTO and the NY marketplace.  He comes from the DEC and knows about environmental issues and generator issues but has a lot to learn about marketers/traders.  Enron is a member of IPPNY and Gavin is new to the organization.  Both Mirant and I agree that we need to be spending more time with Gavin educating him.  What do you think?  Can we schedule something in the near future??
