Kevin this is the forecaster with an attitude.

Sounds like he has a fair amount of drive and would fit in well at Enron.

I have been emailing Craig once a week until I heard from Gerald who I have a lot of faith in as far as reference as I did not want to inherit a problem PHD.  I have asked research (Vasant) to check him out as well.

I believe that this cat might be what I need to get the forecast Rogers and Services need for our wholesale to retail delivery amounts with limited or no metering.  I would have him work on a project that uses the metering we receive to forecast Rogers wholesale delivery requirements hourly.

I will proceed to bring him in unless I hear otherwise from you.

Lloyd

I am on Craig's committee and worked with him for two years (1999-2000)
through his major professor, Eric Bartlett.  I think that Craig is a
self-starting person, familiar with neural networks and statistics.  He has
done a good job with programming on the internet and is very interested in
forecasting.

I think that with the right opportunities, he will do very well.

Gerald can you provide me with the link you are referring to.

Also I have been in contact with a Craig Carmichael.  Can you provide me
with any insight in his forecasting abilities and potential.

   I have been out of the country and out of town for some time.

   I was to visit with Vince Kaminski, but this was delayed and then not
   rescheduled.

   I would like to discuss the web page portal that ENRON has with regard
   to
   retail customers.  We are studying such portals for service marketing.
   Another student and I are designing a set of web pages for a given
   product
   set as a class project.  Could you provide a contact for a short
   conference
   call?

   Thank you,

   Gerry
