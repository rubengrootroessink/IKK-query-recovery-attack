Joe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and Bill Rust is taking his scheduling place.   I have no problem with Joe going with you.   With respect to Narsima, timing may be an issue (transition), however, I should be able to make that happen as well.

With Busby, Bernie, Joe and Narsima (timing an issue), you have some competent support at the outset   In addition, there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline.

Hopefully, the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday.   We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions.
