Kevin,

This is to inform you that I am very excited about an opportunity to join your team.  However, I am not excited about the position I've been offered.  I understand you are working on the economics, but I also want you to know that I am not overly interested in Hourly.  I feel my experience and skill-sets are up for a bigger challenge.  Truthfully, I am interested in a position that will lead into a cash trading position in the future.  I don't see Hourly doing that for me.

Let us talk at your convenience.  Thanks.

Juan
