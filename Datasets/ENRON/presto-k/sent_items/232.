I would like ASAP (by new building) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations (nodes in LMP) and LSE's territory color coded.

This will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions.   It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions.
