Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to offer into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or interface would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use his network transmission).  

Any interest?
