Yes, that would be fine.   I would also like to talk about my fixed annual fee.   Based on the way I trade, and the amount of asset accumulaton, I think my fee is too high.   Please call me about this issue so we can discuss.

I will call the head of online trading tomorrow
and check into it for you.  Are you open to having
someone calling you and picking your brain about
this issue and other things you have mentioned
in the past as well as other improvements.

Regards,

David
