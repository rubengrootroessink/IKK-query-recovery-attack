No problem.  I appreciate the apology.  I just want you to know that my job is to assist you with not only your team but helping you find ways to deal with the difficult questions that will be posed to you.  I know some have answers and some do not at this point. Let me know what I can do to help you deal with them.  The more we continue to communicate the better off you will be at getting you and your team through this.

I apologize for my earlier comments.   Everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company.   I have been here 7 years and I am seeing everything I worked for coming to an end.

It's not your fault and I do apologize.
