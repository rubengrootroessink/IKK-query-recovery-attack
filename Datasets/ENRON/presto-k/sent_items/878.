Edison International purchased all of Com-Ed's gas and coal plants approx. 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-Ed through 2004.

The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.   I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback.
