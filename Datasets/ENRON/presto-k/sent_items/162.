Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-w=
ay termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that=
 indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a=
 provision that allows us to cease delivery "by reason of ... significant c=
hange in operating condition"; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculati=
on, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any lang=
uage that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money=
.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is wit=
h one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisi=
ons and remedies, such as for bankruptcy. (Which I'm assuming you know sinc=
e you're familiar with the contract).  What I didn't know was your longer t=
erm view of the market - this obviously matters in evaluating their offer i=
f the contract is one way and we are unhedged.  In any event, for now they =
can either pay us the $1.2 million or we'll plan on delivering in January. =
 I'll call them onWed and let you know so we can schedule delivery is neces=
sary.=20

Wisconsin's offer is a joke.  =20
=20
Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer=
 at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 C=
om-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.   This is a position we will deliver on t=
o preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin tha=
t we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter beca=
use it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quo=
tes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing l=
ess  than $1.2 million.

Thanks.

This contract is for 50Mw peak into COMED, Seller's Daily Choice, Cal '02 @=
 $34.75/MWh.  Our MTM is $1,244,412; their offer is $663,000.  It appears t=
o be a one-way contract, but it's hard to tell given the brevity of the con=
tract.  David - what happens if we don't serve the load - do we get nothing=
?  We need to decide if we want to begin serving the load and negotiate a b=
etter price - they want to have done by 12/28. =20
