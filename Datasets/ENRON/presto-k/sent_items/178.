Kevin,

Iris Mack is planning to run an hour-long session on Mon, Nov. 5 (1:00-2:00) providing an "Introduction to Options". If successful, this will be followed up with further Monday sessions going into more detail and complexity.

I am planning to send an email out shortly to Origination encouraging people to attend. Would you like me to include Trading in the email?  Or would you like me to forward the text to you for forwarding to trading?

Dave
