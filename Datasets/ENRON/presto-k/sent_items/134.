Attached is my trading agreement file.  We are close on the transmission agreement list (i'll forward when comlete).  I asked Tim to add something to the product list.  I am indifferent as to form of template.  Steffes/Niccolai submitted a reg/gov affairs plan to Louise.  I am also putting together a Gant Chart that shows timeline for the various tasks.
