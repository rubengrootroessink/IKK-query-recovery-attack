No problem.   $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.   You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.   I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.

Sound OK?

Kevin -

Billy closed this deal yesterday in the mid $70's.  i was planning on having Laura liquidate this position daily and pay her something like $1.00 per Mwh.   I would want her to liquidate daily and help me stay informed of what is going on down there and then reserve the right to sell for longer terms - if i say nothing the she would assume to continue to liquidate hourly.  However, my intent is to stay in tune with the market to maintain a good feel of issues in the South so i plan to speak to her daily.

Your thoughts?
