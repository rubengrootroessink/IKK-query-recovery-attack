What is the exact delivery point?   Does it include capacity?   Is it a daily call?   monthly call?   All options are quoted by Harry Arora.

Are you interested in offering the $100 daily call, into Duke, May-Sep'02, up to 100MW?  We may be able to separately offer regulatory capacity off of the Carolina plants we sold to AIG.

I will handle the non-TVA SERC deals until John Suarez joins the group.

Kevin,

Who now handles Duke's system territory with King switching to ERCOT?  You or Fletch?

North Carolina Mun. Power Agency 1 has informally requested up to 100MW of capacity and energy for May-Sep'02 with a "relatively high" strike price (probably $100) into Duke, or regulatory capacity.

Formally, they have issued 2 RFP's:  1) to buy as much as 750MW of intermediate, peaking, and reserve capacity for summer peak months of 2003 and beyond (1-5 years), increasing by approx. 25MW per year; 2) to sell up to eight, 50MW blocks of 7x24 energy, system firm or unit contingent, off of Catawba and/or McGuire nuclear plants, interconnected with the Duke trans. system, beginning 1/1/03 (1-8 year term).
