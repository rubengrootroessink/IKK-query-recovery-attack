I don't like the 2nd bullet - not positive enough.   We are the dominant player in the power market.  With respect to volumes for term trades, the risk group will have to provide that to you.   I can tell you that the volumes have increased in the term market by a significant factor (at least 10 times relative to last year).

Kevin - 

Thanks again for taking the time to visit with us a few weeks back regarding your business.  Based upon our discussions, I have included a draft of an East Power Slide.  We are still waiting on final volumes for 3Q01; however, I was curious if you could take a minute to review the conceptual content and let me know if you have any other ideas/comments.  In the last bullet, we would like to articulate the fact that you are creating liquidity in longer term markets.  If I recall correctly, you mentioned your term volumes had increased exponentially compared to the prior year.  Can we get more specific and talk about # MW's transacted and the length of such contracts? (ie, my last bullet is a placeholder).

We are going to meet with Greg on Friday and discuss a draft of the entire presentation.

When you have a minute, please give me a call at X34785.

Kind Regards.
