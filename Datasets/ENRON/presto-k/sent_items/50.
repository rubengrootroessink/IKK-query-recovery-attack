I will be leaving the office today at 4:00 to catch a flight.  Will be available on my cell until about 6:30.....

If you need to reach me tomorrow, please feel free to call my cell (713-859-6266) or my home (908-806-6619).   I will be checking e-mails throughout the day as well.

Jeanie Slone will also be available for any questions or assistance.

Thanks!
Amy
