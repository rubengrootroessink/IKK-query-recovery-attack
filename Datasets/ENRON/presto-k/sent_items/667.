That's fine.  I thought we already did this.

Do you want me to see if I can do this?  Her current employment agreement draft is for $80,000 on 8/01/01 and $85,000 on 2/1/01.

Kim please advise on the possibility of providing Rika with her new wage as one lump sum rather than waiting until Feb for the other half.

Rika has worked very hard to take our floor to the next level and will be critical for us to continue and I would like to see if we have any latitude to provide her with the above as part of her promotion.  

I explained to her what Kevin's long term objective is for Managers and how he fairly levels the playing field at year end.

Thanks.
