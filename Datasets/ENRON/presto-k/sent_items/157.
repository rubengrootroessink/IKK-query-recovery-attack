Everyone- 

I will be out of town until Friday (will be in office Friday mid-morning) and then we will be in Belize from the 6th to the 13th.  

We will be staying at: 

VICTORIA HOUSE RESORT 
P.O. Box 22 
Ambergris Caye, Belize 
Central America 
Tel: 501-262067 
Fax: 501-262429 

The best way to reach me is probably via my home e-mail (drherndon@aol.com) I will be checking this via internet cafe at least twice a day.  Feel free to call the hotel and leave a message as well.  I will try to check my enron e-mail if i can from Belize.

Have a great New Year and see you briefly on Friday the 4th. 

RH
