The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is valued OK, but the options are not.

In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio.
