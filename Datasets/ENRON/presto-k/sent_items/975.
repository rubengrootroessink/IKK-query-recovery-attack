I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you check into this problem.

I want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date
						Quantity
						Purchase Price
						Last Price
						Cost Basis
						Market Value
						Gain/Loss
						Gain/Loss%

Can you make this the default view setting.

thanks.
