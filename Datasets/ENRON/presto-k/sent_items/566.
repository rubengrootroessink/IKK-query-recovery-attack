I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling.   It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region.   Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.

Maps and graphs are very useful.   The presentation should be very macro in scope.

I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar.

Hi Guys,

I'm sure Lavorato has mentioned to you the above presentation to be given, by your guys, to Lay and Skilling.  The first available date to capture both Lay & Skilling is Monday, July 30 @ 3:00 p.m.  Please advise if this will work for each of you.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor, EA to Greg Whalley
