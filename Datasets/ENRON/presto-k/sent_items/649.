If they are all in the coal group and we get all of the coal curves and transport curves, then the answer is yes.

Matt,

If your group does not yet have permissions for our power forward curves tables, I will email our DBA and make the request.

I need to know the names of the people that need permissions.  If you want IT development, than include your IT person as well.

Thanks,

Diana
