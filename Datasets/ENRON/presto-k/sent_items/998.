On balance, I do not see any problems with the transmission system in the immediate area surrounding Racoon Creek. (i.e. you could sell to AMRN or anyone in AMRN's control area) That being said, note that the posted ATC from AMRN to various interfaces for summer 2002 is:

	AMRN-CIN	   0 MW
	AMRN-AEP 	   0 MW
	AMRN-CE	   0 MW
	AMRN-ALTW	230 MW
	AMRN-NSP	160 MW
	AMRN-TVA	   0 MW

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, let me know.
