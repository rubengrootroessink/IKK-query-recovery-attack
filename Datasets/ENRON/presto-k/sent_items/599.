I need 2 additional tickets for the Washington game that are next to my 4 season tickets.   I will call you later today to give you my AMEX to get the parking pass and confirm the specific seat location.   Patrick never called me to confirm the seats in the front row of the upper section, therefore, your message is the first confirmation I have received.

Thanks.

Kevin,
 
I got your message  today regarding the invoices that you have received for tickets.  I am  sorry I didn't have a chance to call you back.
 
The only invoices  that you should have received recently are for the 6 Washington tickets and the  SVIP parking pass.  I faxed these to you about a week  ago.
 
As part of your  membership at the Golden Cane level, you are entitled to 4 complimentary season  tickets.  Based on your conversation with Patrick, these are going to be  located in the section in front of the press box reserved for Golden Canes and  Living Scholars.  Your parking pass and any additional season, home or away  game tickets would need to be purchased.
 
Please let me know  if you have any additional questions or concerns.  Thank you, once again,  for continued support of the Hurricane Club.
