Sounds like you are as busy as I am.   Yes, my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick.   My Dad retired from teaching in WA (collecting WA retirement) and has been teaching in Hermiston, OR for the last 7 years.

Just to clarify, Enron's international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the Enron North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   Enron NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.

Enron's international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.

I will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see Enron applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model.

Later.

I'm really surprised that this email found you -- it was a shot in the dark.  Glad to hear that you are doing well.   You have a better memory than mine, but I believe that you are right.  The last time that I did see you was at the wedding.  That was a long time ago.  I have not stayed in touch with anyone from that area.  Although, my parents still live outside of Pasco.  I haven't been to the Tri-Cities in years, though, since my family usually meets in Seattle where my sisters live.  Do your parents still live in the Tri-Cities?  How do you like Houston?  I almost moved there a couple of years ago to take a job with Unocal.

Since the last time I saw you, I went to the U.W. for undergrad and then headed East to go to grad school at the University of Virginia where I did a M.A. in international affairs and econ.  I gravitated to the D.C. area for international work where I have remained since then.  I worked for the International Finance Corporation with the World Bank for about five years covering investments in South Asia.   The travel to India was fun, but a little crazy at times.  I would inevitably get sick when I went there.  The early 90s was an interesting time to be in India, as the country was just starting to privatize.  If you were in Bombay's financial district, you would still see piles of notes being wheeled around in rickshaws to the stock exchange.

I eventually left the IFC (Wall Street hours w/o the pay) and moved to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, where I spent about five years doing partial risk guarantees for Turkey and that region.  I encountered Enron's project finance team in Houston and your D.C. rep., John Hardy.  Enron has a plant in Turkey for which OPIC guaranteed and provided financing.  Enron was/is one of OPIC's largest clients, receiving support for Dabhol, etc.  However, I know that Enron is now pulling back from these types of ventures, which is where your work is focussed, I gather.  It must be an interesting job, I would like to hear more about it.  I haven't really followed Enron's move into the power trading sector.

I just changed jobs about a month ago and now work at Fannie Mae (still in D.C.) buying and pricing mortgage-backed securitizations.  I cover the West Coast and Dallas area.   It is a big switch from IFC and OPIC b/c it is all domestic, so my boondoggles to Turkey, etc. have been cut off.  So far, I like the company.  I had worked on providing wraps on bonds to mitigate some sovereign risks for emerging market issuers while at OPIC.  I spent a fair amount of time with capital market investors and investment banks, so I made the move to Fannie Mae to concentrate specifically on the secondary market.  I'll probably roll this experience into international structured transactions in a year or two.  I'm also doing my MBA at Georgetown right now.  It should be a busy year...CAE
