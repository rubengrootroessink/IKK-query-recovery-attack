Kevin, as an FYI, here are the stats on the completion of the performance reviews.  Information will be sent most likely this week to the office of the chair in reference to the statistics.  VP and MD reviews are to be completed by the 31st while the remaining job groups were due on the 17th.

13 complete out of 65 = 20%

Arora - 2 out of 2 = 100%
Davis - 1 out of 11
Gilbert-Smith - 0 out of 5
Herndon - 1 out of 9
Presto - 1 out of 10
Sturm - 7 out of 8
Will - 1 out of 20
