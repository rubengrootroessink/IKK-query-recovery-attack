Mine.  Looks good.   We should get one suite as well that we can use as a beer drinking hospitality room.   I'll confirm dates with you later today or tommorow.

thanks.

I believe this is the best choice-  Great hotel, close to town with golf, tennis, fishing right there.   The rooms are great and the beach is awesome.  Check it out!!!  Let me know what you think and we'll book it.
