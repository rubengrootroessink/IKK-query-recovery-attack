Berney -

I think that we need to go with 

> 1 million Mwh = Presto 
> 2 million Mwh = Lavo 

This may still be too restrictive and burdensome on Lavo and Presto.

Kevin - what do you think?

Is the level for Presto/Belden still too low? What about 500,000 or 1 million?

Thoughts?

California deals done during the next two weeks need to be signed by Perry, Richter, and Belden.  Thanks.

While soliciting signatures for the IBM DASH, John Lavorato stated that Rogers Herndon and/or Tim Belden should sign the RAC DASH.  Effective immediately, we will remove Lavorato from the Approval to Issue Executable Pricing and the RAC DASH signature page.  With these changes in place, the approval authority for the EWS Power Desks will be as follows:

			 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 
	

Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any changes.  In the meantime, we will proceed with the approval authorities above.
