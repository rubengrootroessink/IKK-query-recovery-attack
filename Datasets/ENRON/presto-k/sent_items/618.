I want our VAR to be accurate on all accounts and I will settle for nothing less.

Importance:	High

Kevin,
I have been asked to assign priority regarding Enpower and the PortCalc output.  The issue is that the heat rate swaps send info to the VAR calc under the wrong risk type, misstating risk.  In essence, the price/basis decomposition isn't happening, so risk is misstated. (potentially grossly misstated, pending book and quantity.

Do you want this completed ASAP, or do you want it to wait in cue pending other projects?

Frank

Dear All,

	For the Heat Rate Swaps, we have gone through the PortCalc program and confirmed that it is using the combined NG price and Basis for the calculations, it is not an easy task to split the calculation and store the results separately, please let us know if this is of utmost importance and shall be prioritized accordingly.

	Regards,


Norman.
