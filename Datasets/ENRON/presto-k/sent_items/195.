They have over 2500 MW at Wansley over 2 coal plants and 4 gas turbines (in CC).   They can offer LD at this location

Southern is evaluting the 7x24 offer from the Wansley delivery point.  They indicated hesitance to offer LD, but are more amenable to offer LD if have choice of delivery points.  I indicated we had the preference of Wansley, but would also consider Scherer.  I'll let you know what they come back with.
