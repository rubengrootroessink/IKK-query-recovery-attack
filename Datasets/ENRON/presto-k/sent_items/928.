John Lavorato has requested the attached report. He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories- in particular, Real Time Traders. If you would, please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening, if possible. I'm at x30352 if you have any questions. Thanks!
