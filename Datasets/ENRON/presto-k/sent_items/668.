Tobey -

I would classify URM as :

Trading 
Power

Kevin - do you and Jeff agree?  I guess we could classify them as Origination?

I'm working with the ISC on categorizing profit center numbers and setting up the EWS SAP hierarchy.

Please categorize URM as one of the following Business Activities:

Trading
Origination
Merchant Investments
Asset Operations


and one of the following product groups:

Gas
Power
Equity
Debt

Thanks!
