Please begin working on filling our Associated short position in 02.   I would like to take this risk off the books.

In addition, please find out what a buy-out of VEPCO would cost us.   With Rogers transitioning to run our retail risk management, I would like to clean up our customer positions.

We also need to continue to explore a JEA buy-out.

Thanks.
