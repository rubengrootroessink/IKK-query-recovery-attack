You have the latitude to put your key people under contract.   Edith was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers.

Kevin -

I had a discussion with Berney last night re: Edith.  I think we need to consider putting her under contract.  I would really like to try to entice her to help us for 12 months and I think if she were given some economic incentive or assurance we might have a chance.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is where she can add the most value to Enron.  Ultimately, I would like to be able to promote individuals like Edith out into the EES marketing/sales staff to represent Enron on the front lines commercially.

Despite where she goes, I think a contract is probably a wise move for Enron and always makes a person feel good and keeps them motivated.  Also, I think hearing some assurances from you and/or Lavo would probably be appropriate with her.   She knows how Berney and I feel but there is no real guarantee in our assurances yet.

Thanks,
Rogers



Another guy we need to think about is Mark Ulrich in the URM team - this guy is outstanding and I want to shield him from other parts of ENE.
