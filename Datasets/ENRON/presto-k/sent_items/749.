Have you spoke to Greg Whalley about Kristen Albrecht, Dierdra McCaffery, Jim Brysch, and Heather Kendall.   We need to move forward on putting these teams together, and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months.

I would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals.

Thanks.
