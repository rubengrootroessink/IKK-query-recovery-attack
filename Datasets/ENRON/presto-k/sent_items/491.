Kevin,

New York Pizzaria just called and wanted to know if we would like to have a Happy Hour at their new location in Mid Town @ Gray & Bagby.  We would have to set it up between the following dates:  June 26th - July 6th (4:30pm - 7:30pm).  They are asking their top clients to come in and try out the new location.


Let me know what you think,
