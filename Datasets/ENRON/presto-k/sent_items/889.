Kevin,
	We will continue to monitor the situation and update you as information is received.

The Union is waiting on a NRB (National Labor Relations Board) ruling which should happen this afternoon or Monday.  This ruling could mandate Midwest to come to the negotiation table.
If the ruling says Midwest doesn't have to "go to the table" then the Union will strike.  It will take 1-2 weeks for the workers to organize a strike after the NRB ruling is made.  According to labor insiders, when the workers walk out they will either turn the machines over to non-union workers or turn them off.  The labor source believes that Midwest does not have the non-union workforce needed to take over for the union workers in the event of a strike.
If the ruling says Midwest has to "go to the table" then by law they will have to begin negotiations.
