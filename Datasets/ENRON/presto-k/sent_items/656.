Subject:	Good Bye

As most of you already know I am leaving Enron after five years to go to Harvard MBA School.  My times at Enron have been beyond the expectations that I had when I stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night  when  I first became an Enron analyst.  Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.  

Even though I contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years, I never left for another company.  I came to realize that the people that work here are the best, and I have always strived to be among the best.  Aside from the professional skills and energy, the people here have become good friends of mine.   Enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years.

Special thanks to Jim Fallon, Jeff Golden, Mark Muller, Dave Delainey, Kevin Presto, and Rogers Herndon, all of  whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here.

Please find my forwarding email address, phone numbers, and address.  If any of you need anything or come to Boston please look me up, I will always buy the first beer!  Good luck to you all.

Your friend,

John
