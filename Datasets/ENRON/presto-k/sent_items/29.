What do you need from me?   Do you want me to meet with him?  talk to him on the phone?   go to lunch?    is he looking for a job?    As you can see, I don't have much information of the objective here.

Kevin,

It looks like Tuesday morning will work best for Erik.  I am supposed to meet with him at 9:00 am Tuesday morning, but
am flexible if that time works for you.  Just let me know what time is ideal and I will schedule it with Erik.
