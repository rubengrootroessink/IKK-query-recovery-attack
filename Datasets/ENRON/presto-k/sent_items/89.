We are scheduled to meet with Mike Hutchins and John Costas in Stamford on Friday.  Tammie is co-ordinating the trip but essentially there is no current plan for Thursday night but we will need to be there in time for an early start on Friday.  On Friday each of us will meet with John and Mike, have lunch, tour the facilities etc then depart.

That's all I know - Tammie is trying to get more details.
