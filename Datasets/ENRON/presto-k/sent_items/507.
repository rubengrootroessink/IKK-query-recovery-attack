The following information is from a Union source:
Union planning to go on strike at 6am tomorrow morning  (1200 employees of which 250 are Management)
The current shift is the last prior to the strike
Meeting continue today and through out the night
A Federal mediator has been bought in to try and help the situation
The only way the Union won't go on strike is if there is a tentative agreement in place with Midwest, however, everyone involved feels these chances are slim 
When a strike occurs, it will affect 7 plants
