Rika,

Please assign an analyst to show all generation in the Com-Ed control area.   The primary owners are:

	1)  Edison International (former Com-Ed coal plants)
	2) Com-Ed (nuclear and some GT's)
	3) People's (Elwood and one other merchant plant)
	4) 5-6 miscellanious merchant plants (includes Allegheny's Lincoln Center facility)

Kevin and Rika -

We are preparing for a negotiation with ComEd this Friday pertaining to their filing to accelerate the termination of the PPO (Purchased Power Option) rate schedule we currently utilize to serve our customers.  In its absence we would have to roll over to a much higher priced BBR (Bundled Rate) or Physically serve.  Our position is that physical delivery in ComEd is not really open access - primarily due to the fact that 1) the rules have not been spelled out clearly and 2) there is a concentration of power re: ancillary services in the hands of the generators in ComEd's territory.  

Do we have a map or a list of all of the generation in the state (and specifically in the Chicago area) by fuel type and by owner?  We want to be able to show concentration of these assets in the hands of the few.

Our meeting is Friday and this analysis would be huge (our $$ exposure to their proposal is significant) in our negotiation.

Please let me or Mark Ulrich know if there is any way you could assist us.

Thanks,
Rogers
