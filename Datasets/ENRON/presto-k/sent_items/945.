Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their c=
ompany hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.   Calp=
ine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged=
 effectively in the non-CA locations.

Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particul=
ary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probabili=
ty on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at D=
ighton, particularly with the legal issues.

I wanted to give you a quick update on this.  After reviewing the various a=
ngles on this with structuring, it was evident that the best real prospect =
for doing something with them was for us to receive a below mkt position fr=
om Calpine off of Dighton (so as to force Coenergy (gas supplier) to make a=
s large a termination pmt to Calpine as possible).  In return, we would pro=
vide some other form of value (e.g., low cost capital to facilitate re-fina=
ncing of Dighton once gas agreement terminated, we sell them a below mkt po=
sition in another region, etc.).   I floated this proposal verbally to Paul=
 Barnett about a 1-1.5 weeks ago, and his reaction was sort of "that sounds=
 interesting" but he didn't show a great deal of genuine interest.  I indic=
ated to him that I would work up a more specific written proposal.   Howeve=
r, after discussing with our legal dept, they had some real angst of me mak=
ing a formal written proposal to them in this regard (concerns centering ar=
ound tortious interference, etc.).  Based on that, I called Barnett back sa=
ying I was unable to make a formal written proposal along the lines of my v=
erbal proposal to him, but that we would still be interested and indicated =
that the ball is in his court if he wants to pursue that angle.  As yet I h=
ave not heard back from him, and i do not hold a lot of hope that they want=
 to pursue this.   Kevin - please let me know if you think trying to chase =
this more makes sense based on your discussions with Paul P. a few weeks ba=
ck.
