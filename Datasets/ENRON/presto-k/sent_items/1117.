Rika,
The meetings are starting to be more substantive.  I'm listing four meetings
here along with Fred's recommendations:

Following Fred recommends attending:

1. 11/8/01  NRC staff assessment on vessel head penetration nozzle cracking.
At meeting will be Nuclear Energy Institute and several PWR licensees.  May
get insight to several plants outage plans.

2. 11/9/01  Discuss TMI steam generator severed tube discovered during
refueling.  Could provide upcoming outage plans and industry plans for steam
generator integrity.

3. 11/15/01  Management meeting with Watts Bar to discuss plant performance
and refueling outage plans.

Following Fred does not think is worth it:
1. 11/13/01  Ginna (NYPP) evaluation regarding potential for circumferential
cracking of reactor vessel head penetration nozzles.  Possible insight to
refueling plans.

I need to know soon since the first one on the list is tomorrow.
Thanks,
Dan
