I read the proposal last night, and although it is not perfect, it is a big=
 improvement over what we have today.   Therefore, I (and my team) support =
Enron's endorsement of the PJM Proposal (with your timeline condition).

Thanks for all your good work.

Kevin:

I think the PJM proposal looks pretty good as a first step.  As we discusse=
d in Houston, the proposal gives us a single day-ahead and real time energy=
 market for the entire Northeast, but it does not get us everything at firs=
t.  For example, on Day One, PJM proposes to retain the 4 existing control =
areas and allow the individual control areas to redispatch in the real time=
 market for local transmission constraints.  This could result in New York =
continuing to manipulate the market in an attempt to keep prices down, but =
as we discussed in Houston (and as Andy Ott has confirmed), it is highly un=
likely that PJM will allow New York to continue this type of market interfe=
rence once PJM is in charge and running the market.  Also, by leaving some =
of the existing systems in place, PJM has aptly responded to the New York a=
rgument that "local reliability" in New York must be maintained, so that Ne=
w York's opposition is seen for what it is -- an attempt to delay indefinit=
ely an RTO in the Northeast.

Enron's support of the PJM proposal would be very helpful in mediation sinc=
e we are seen as a big player in the region and because the other two propo=
sals on the table are sponsored by the New York TOs and the New York ISO an=
d envision a new RTO system based on the PJM "Platform" changed by as-yet u=
ndefined "Best Practices" from the other two ISOs (and New York has indicat=
ed it thinks a lot of its market design is a "best practice"), and these ot=
her options will not begin operation for 3-5 years at best.

Nevertheless, even though we here in Washington think the PJM proposal look=
s good, it is important that you and your team are also comfortable with it=
.  If you all have not had an opportunity to review the proposal to ensure =
that you are satisfied with it, then I would propose that we not sign Enron=
's name onto the proposal.  We can talk about the proposal in more detail a=
nd even have Andy Ott available for a conference call or a trip to Houston =
to answer any questions you may have.  If you need more time, then I think =
we should follow this route instead, even if it means we cannot lend our su=
pport for PJM at this time.

Please let me know what you think.

Sarah

Are we sure we can live with everything else in the PJM Single RTO proposal=
?

Subject:=09Support of PJM's Proposal to Implement Northeast RTO

As I mentioned to each of you today, we plan to sign Enron's name as a memb=
er of the "One RTO Coalition" in support of PJM's proposal for developing a=
 single Norhteast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market i=
n the Northeast.  PJM's proposal is attached.  As you may recall, I gave yo=
u a copy of PJM's proposal and we discussed it when I was in Houston a coup=
le of weeks ago.  The main concern with PJM's proposal is its timing -- the=
ir time line provides for an implementation date of November 2003.  We have=
 talked extensively with PJM about the need to speed up the implementation =
process, and PJM agrees that they will move aggressively, but they are unwi=
lling to change their target date in their proposal.

Because we disagree with the PJM date, we propose to have Enron Power Marke=
ting, Inc.'s name included on the list of supporters of the proposal, with =
the following footnote:

=09While all of the members of the One RTO Coalition support the substance =
of PJM's proposal to implement a single energy market as described herein, =
Enron =09Power Marketing, Inc. dissents from PJM's date of November 2003 fo=
r implementing the single RTO in the Northeast.  Enron believes that the PJ=
M proposal =09can and must be implemented by December 2002 and that extensi=
on of the implementation date past December 2002 is unnecessary and contrar=
y to the =09Commission's RTO policy established in Order No. 2000.

This footnote will preserve our right to argue against PJM's timing in comm=
ents to the Commission after the Judge submits his report (due on September=
 17).  In those comments we can go into much greater detail about the need =
for quick implementation.

Please let me know if you have any suggested changes to the footnote or if =
you disagree with our proposed strategy.  We will address this issue on Thu=
rsday at mediation (I thought it was going to come up today, which is why I=
 called each of you), so if you have any comments or concerns, please let m=
e know as soon as possible.=20

Thanks

Sarah
