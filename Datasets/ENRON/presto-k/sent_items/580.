Beth,

Given our conversation two weeks ago, I want to keep the ball rolling at light speed.  Therefore, I would like to get together to walk through the action plan for the following:

Tariff - Flash to Actual
Intra-desk Settlements
Daily Tariff P/L
Update the wholesale equivalents to retail generation positions
Daily Price Curve changes by rate schedule
Daily P/L by utility rate schedule


I will ask my assistant to set-up this meeting for early next week.

Thanks

Jay
