Announcing the new Single Market Design Forum
MISO, PJM and SPP announce the formation of a Single Market Design Forum.
The forum is designed for the purpose of identifying the needs of market
participants and promoting effectiveness and efficiency in electricity
markets. The forum hopes to meet the needs of all customers and stakeholders
using the electric power grid. 
The boards of directors, officers and members of MISO, PJM and SPP have a
shared vision and are committed to the development of a single market. Many
market participants, state commissions and FERC have expressed a desire for
this type of common market structure.
The first meeting of the Single Market Design Forum is scheduled for Friday,
February 8, in Washington, D.C., at the FERC Building, 888 First Street,
N.E. A registration form and meeting details are attached to this message.
