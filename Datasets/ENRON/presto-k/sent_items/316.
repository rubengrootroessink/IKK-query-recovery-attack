I want only firm delivered LD offers for this position.   Please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our JEA obligation.

Thanks.

Kevin, 

I've received interest from several potential sellers to fill the JEA position.  I sent the monthly on- and off-peak needs, requesting offers from the following:  Morgan Stanley, Orlando, Seminole, Calpine, Cargill, FPC, FPL, and FMPA.  I'll keep you informed as I receive responses.  Everyone expressed an extreme interest as they are all long power for the remaining term of this position.
