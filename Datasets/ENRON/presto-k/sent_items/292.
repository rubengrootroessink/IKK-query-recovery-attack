You have the right Kevin Presto.   I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years.   I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.    Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and Enron's culture in general.

How are you doing?   I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.   I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.

Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron?

Hi Kevin,

Apologies if this is the wrong Kevin Presto, but I ran across your name
on the Enron website.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work
with Enron on overseas ventures and was surprised to see your name on
the website.  Did you grow up in the Tri-Cities, Washington, and attend
Bethlehem Lutheran School?  If so, I am not sure if you remember me, but

I also went to BLS and was your classmate.

Drop me a line if I have the right person.  Would be interested to
hear about your work at Enron and what you have done in the interim
after leaving Washington state.

Chris Engstrom
