With your retail short position in PJM, I assume we are short ICAP as well.   We should have your guys or Ader & Company follow-up on the 42 MW that is available.   Hopefully, it is in E PJM.

Kevin;  Willamette Industries has 42 MW of "certified" available capacity within PJM that another Marketer has approached them about selling.  Is someone from Enron East interested in submitting a Bid?  Thanks,  John
