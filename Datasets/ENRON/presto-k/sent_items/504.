Kevin,

Hello!  I hope you will remember me from the EPP days.  You may be aware that I joined the Research group here in Houston in February.

You maybe aware that Stinson Gibner who was in the Research group left late last month, and I am now taking over some of the things he was earlier looking into.

One of those is trying to get a good feel for how well your group is being supported by Research, and to provide timely help where needed.  Whenever you have a moment, I would like to meet with you or anyone you designate to get a better idea for your needs and also collect any feed back that you may have for me.

Regards,
Sandeep.
