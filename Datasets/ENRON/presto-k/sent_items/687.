Kevin -

Definitely get in touch with Mickey Ferrell (Ferrille?) Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth's family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.

You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:

1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott's house) 
2) Water front on and around "the Island"  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from)
3) Waterfront "Up-River"  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homes

Expect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.

The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.

Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie's husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren't everything is accessible through the lodge.

Good luck,

RH
