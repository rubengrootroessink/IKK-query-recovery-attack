Absolutely.   Please call Lloyd Will to get access to our new intranet site which has an unbelievable amount of data on historical prices, loads, new gen, HDD's, CDD's, outages, etc.

Our new fundies group is 100% better in terms of data quality and presentation.

Kevin,

Can I get a copy of the market fundamentals (capacity additions/retirements, load growth, proposed RTO structure, etc.) for the southeast power market?  I want to try to get a jump start before my move to the desk.

Thanks.
