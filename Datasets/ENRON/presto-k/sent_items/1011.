Could you please create an org chart by function (retained employees) and org chart by function (severed employees) so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone.

Once we have done this, we can create a seating plan that is optimal.   Please e-mail me the org. charts so I have an electronic version.

Thanks.
