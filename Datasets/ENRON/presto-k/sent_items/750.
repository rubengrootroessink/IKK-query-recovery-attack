Your perception is correct.   Remember 4 years of culture is at work here.   I told Rogers this morning, we have to move to 35, clearly define the process for pricing deals, and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value.

The whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought.
