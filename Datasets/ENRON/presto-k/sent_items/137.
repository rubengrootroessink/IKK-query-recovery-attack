I want to make sure we get the hardware and software (I agree that this is =
already the property of ENA) into Netco like we have the rest of the softwa=
re/hardware critical to the trading organization.   The payable is sunk and=
 should be left with the estate.

See the below.  Do you still want to transfer the hardware and software?  A=
lso, I would assume that Netco would assume the $1.5 million payable.  Shou=
ld the memberships be assigned, if assignable?

I have been told that all control area agreements have lapsed and are no lo=
nger in effect.  Per David Portz, there are still in existence memberships =
with regional authorities (you pay dues and you get to vote) which he says =
will lapse when the regional authorities determine that Enron no longer con=
trols any load.  Also, there are items of software and hardware used by Enr=
on-SE Corp., which would be transferred to Netco.  I do not think that the =
hardware and software is owned by Enron-SE, since purportedly the only asse=
t showing on the books of Enron-SE is a receivable of $1,218 from ENA.  The=
 software and hardware was purchased from ESCA and $1.5 million is still ow=
ed.  David Portz thought that EPMI or ENA actually purchased the hardware a=
nd software (and I think probably still owns it).  I am attempting to ascer=
tain ownership from accounting.  Based on these facts, it does not appear t=
hat there is any great benefit to the estate in keeping the hardware and so=
ftware.  Further, the outstanding payable of $1.5 could be transferred to N=
etco.
