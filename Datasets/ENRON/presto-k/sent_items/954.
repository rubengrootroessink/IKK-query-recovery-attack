You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set=
 up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should=
 be:

=091) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition=
, risk systems, deal capture system, status of =09projects, schedule, etc.)
=092) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff, =
 and gas)
=093) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East ta=
riffs)
=094) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal va=
luation, new model construction)
=095) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio=
 valuation - works with Richter)
=096) You and I find the holes and provide direction.

Your thoughts?

i think that we need to have an "org chart" meeting where we have don, roge=
rs, and jeff present to us how everything is going to work.  i am getting f=
eedback from a bunch of people (donovan, swain, perry, richter) that people=
 in ees and on the ees transition team are feeling like they don't know wha=
t's going on.  we need this thing to be a lot tighter than it is now and we=
 need clear accountability that is visible not just to us, but to everyone.=
  we need to have this meeting asap.  for example, sally beck is has put to=
gether her proposed structure.  who on our team will liais with her.  how w=
ill it work?  as we discussed the other day, the deal review team is unders=
taffed.  rogers, don, or jeff needs to be wearing it.  once we have the res=
ponsibilities clearly layed out, then at a minimum you, don, rogers, jeff, =
and i should meet once a week to get a high level update from each of them =
on their areas of responsibility.  if we don't do this we will quickly devo=
lve into chaos.  let me know your thoughts.

Didn't we already hang Richter with this at the Monday mtg.   By the way, L=
avo has indicated he will just attend our Monday meetings every couple of w=
eeks instead of having a separate meeting.

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing a=
nd valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B i=
s a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them s=
eparately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that =
gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather tha=
n a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

To all,

The following is documentation of a sample EES deal which was tested in the=
 Enpower system.  This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me k=
now if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points. =20

Over the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal =
in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The dea=
l is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, A=
ncillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site =
out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest stru=
ctures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the s=
ame time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will hel=
p highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's curren=
t state.

Quick statistics for ONE site:

Each month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months=
 (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) too=
k 8-9 hours to book.
Since each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hou=
rs to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not=
 booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).
Although we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least =
four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.
Once we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.
All of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deal=
s.

Recommendations:

Work with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for=
 position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accoun=
ting, etc.
In the interim:

Enhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation proce=
ss.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting=
.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve =
shift, reg switch options, and new deals.
Enhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently ha=
ve an intramonth book).
Integrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a=
 stand-alone spreadsheet application.
Support the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves=
 into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).
Move all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk i=
nstead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports =
will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. =09


Here is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:

Week 1 (May 14-18)

Read Contract.
Get Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary'=
s, etc.
Sit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual=
 questions.
Work on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.

Week 2 (May 21-25)

Continue working on Full Requirements model.
Work with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points =
and curves in Enpower.=09
Begin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.
Discovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We h=
ad gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.
At times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never=
 entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from=
 entering any new data.

Week 3 (May 29-June 1)

Finished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale mo=
del tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The=
 current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated u=
sing the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day p=
rice, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  =
This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the cur=
ves as $/Kw-month.
Again, we ran into problems with the test database.
Completed booking in Enpower.

Week 4 (June 4-5)

Took 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.
Discovered deal entry errors in booking.
