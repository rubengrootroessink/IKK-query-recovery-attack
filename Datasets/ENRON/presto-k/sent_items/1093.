Rika,
For months we had no meetings, now all of a sudden I'm bringing one up
almost every week.

This meeting Fred said would be very beneficial to attend.  It occurs Nov
1&2, 2001.  It concerns nuclear industry consolidation and deregulation
issues.  It is covering a full range of important issues in our forecasting
analysis including licensing, inspection, enforcement & assessment,
decommissioning, deregulation, etc.

Again, I brought this up to Fred to see if he agreed on the import of this
meeting, and he strongly suggested we attend.

Let me know as soon as possible because it is scheduled for this week.

Thanks,
Dan
