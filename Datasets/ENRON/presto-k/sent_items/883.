Kevin and Rodgers,

I received a business plan from a company, PsyCor, that designs and develops software which facilitates management of T&D assets.  PsyCor believes that they will accumulate real-time information on transmission availability and data to facilitate generation to customer load matching, both of which presumably you can use for trading.

A one-page description is attached.  If this is of any interest to you, I can go into greater detail and/or get a copy of the business plan to you or someone in your group.

Regards,
