Thanks.

Kevin,

I need a couple of days so that I can talk to Paul and Jim;  last Friday was spent notifying everyone who is affected by the reorg;  today they are trying to rationalize the network (more changes);  I am interested, however I owe it to Jim and Paul to discuss it with them before I decide.

Let me know if this is a problem for you.

Thanks.
John
