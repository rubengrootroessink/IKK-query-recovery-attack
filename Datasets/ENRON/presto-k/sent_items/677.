I lost $2 million in new deal P&L putting the spread on because they have their curves so srewed up.   With respect to your question, I think the answer is yes because I can sell 02 on-line by controlling the stack (limit orders) and the coal group will sell 03-04 at $35/ton.   I now own this at $32 because they mis-mark their curve in 04 by $4.00/ton (ie negative $2 million in new deal P&L.)

The bottom line is it was painful putting that spread on.

Good info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.

Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call Alan.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.

Kevin -

I just received this.  You may want to read it and we can give Alan a call if you like.
