I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.

I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:

	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)
	2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time)
	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
	4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday
	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)

Let me know if this works for you guys.

should he be on the trip?  we could make him fly to portland.  to ease the travel he could spend a day or two working out of our office.
