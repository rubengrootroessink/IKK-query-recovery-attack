thanks for the heads up.   I will forward this e-mail to EOL and Legal.   I understand his point.

Kevin -

Just got off the phone with Jackie Thomas at Relaint.  I worked with Jackie many years ago and I think he runs their power trading desk.  Anyway, he said he has had heartburn with the way EOL notifies users of contract/confirm changes.  EOL puts up a banner notifying the user of the change but he claims that if the user does not log on for several days then the banner may not appear, yet the contract change has been implemented.  Jackie cited the specific instance of the ERCOT 138 kv delivery requirement as an example of a change that apparently "slipped by".  Jackie feels that either the banner should stay active on a user by user basis until that user logs in and acknowledges it or a notice should be sent to a legal contact at the company - preferably both.  He does not feel as though our legal group appreciates his concern and their legal group is recommending that they halt trading on EOL unless some safeguards are implemented - he does not want to do this.

I am not sure if the situation he described is accurate, but I did want this info to be conveyed and I think someone from EOL should call him to discuss.  Jackie's number is 713-2071308.  I would be glad to continue to facilitate discussions if necessary.

Thanks,
Rogers
