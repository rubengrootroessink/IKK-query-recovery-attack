John Dorbone (sp?).   You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site.   They have 4 custom builders (Tom Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and Tom Hale).   They recently fired Coventry and Frederick Harris.

I have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative.   It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house.
