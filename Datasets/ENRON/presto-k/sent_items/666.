I keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons.   I lose control of who has access outside my group, therefore, I have chosen to not make it available.   EOL has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis.

Kevin,
I work in EIM Fundamentals Steel group.  As a part of my responsibilities I was entrusted with developing and maintaining a cost- curve model for steel mills, to help develop a trading curve.  Electricity is one of the key costs for minimills/integrated steel producers.  I would like to request access to Curve Fetch for power curves.   I would like to receive annual 10-year mid or bid curves for Chicago area on weekly basis.  Please let me know what would be the appropriate procedure to do this.
Thanks,
