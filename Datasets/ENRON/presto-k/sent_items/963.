No chance.  He gets nothing other than the pricing model through structuring.

Lloyd,

The Enron Hedge Fund team in the NY office is interested in marketing power (energy only right now) to the hedge funds that we are already marketing nat. gas, crude oil, products, etc... to.  Our team has a very solid working relationship with the fundamentals groups in gas and crude&products.  As I will be directly responsible for marketing power to the funds, I would like to develop that same level of relationship with the power fundamentals group.  As a middle marketer, I will always be talking to Enron's power traders first before giving a quote out to any of the funds on a transaction.  I look forward to hearing back from you and Rika in regards to this initiative.

Regards,

Stephen Plauche

PS: Although I am up in NY about half the time, I am still a Houston based employee.  Cheers.
