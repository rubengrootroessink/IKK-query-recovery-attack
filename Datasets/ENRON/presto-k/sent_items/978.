The $5 million is strictly an internal trading #, and is irrelevant from an acct. standpoint.   We can ignore it for the DASH.

Kevin,

In connection with Lisa's preparation of the FASH for this transaction, she has asked whether there are any "hedges" that need to be unwound.  I told her that from our conversations, I was of the opinion that there were (approx. $5,000,000 in costs associated with the unwind).  Please confirm.

Stuart
