I know you would not bid the entire 1000Mwe, we are trying to come up with a proxy to assist in the bid, I am also trying to get you in with Mr.Green and the 150-200Mwe indicative would be great. I need it by Wednesday (2/13/02).
Thanks for the return e-mail.
 
Did you see the alert from the FBI yesterday and today ?
 
Fred

I'll get back with you on this within a couple of days.   Do you want an indicative bid for 7x24 bus-bar energy (2, 5 and 10 years).   We would not bid on the entire 1000 MW - maybe 150-200 MW.
 
thanks for the info.

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?
Call me at 864-370-0217 or 864-235-5607 or mobile 864-275-3193
Thanks
Fred
