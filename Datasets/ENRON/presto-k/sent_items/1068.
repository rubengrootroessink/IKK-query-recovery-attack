Good day all:

In preparation for this weekend I wanted to get a time that each of your groups will be available for us to start the equipment moves.  If you could reply to this message with the business units you support and the time that we can start that would allow us to better schedule this weekend.  


Once a time has been established, please notify the people in your group that we will begin shortly after the defined time.


If you have any special circumstances that need considering, please call me at x34344. 

Thank you,

Daniel A. Muschar
