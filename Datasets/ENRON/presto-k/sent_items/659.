Kevin,

FPC has indicated that it will be long 150MW beginning 1/1/02, as it has lost some of its Seminole load to Calpine (to a former FPC employee).  They are selling the 150MW of energy and capacity system firm (equivalent to FPC's native load), but will entertain firm LD bids.  They will sell smaller block sizes if necessary.  

When I get more info., I will discuss the opportunity further with you.

Billy
