As usual, your position is way too logical.   Do I need to attend this meeting?

FYI - 

My position is as follows:

I am trying to narrow the focus on our curve review and maintenance to JUST areas where we have existing positions and possibly areas that are in or near full dereg stages (NE, IL, TX, OH).  Currently URM is responsible for virtually every curve and thus knows very little about a whole lot.  The proposed reduction would help URM focus on what is important and allow them to "get it right".

I do not think it is necessary nor is it appropriate to offer bundled products until we can determine effective ways to reduce our existing exposure.  I do think we can stand ready to adjust this strategy if necessary and on a case by case basis.

I do think we can offer shaped, staggered maturity wholesale products to generally hedge customers in regulated states against directional price movements. I am absolutely against offering anything that looks like the traditional Retail Index Product.

I expect to get a little push back on this approach and also think I will hear that it is necessary to offer bundled products to support DSM.  As I said in my last tariff strategy meeting, I would be glad to give URM to Ozzie too.  I will be a much better bid for DSM related T/D positions as offsets to current positions.
