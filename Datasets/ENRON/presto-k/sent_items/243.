TJ,
 
Please provide me with the latest hard copy so I can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for East Power seating.
 
Thanks.

Subject: Updated floor plans



Attached are the revised floor plans with data that has been presented through today.  Tina Rode has submitted the churns for the groups that fall under Duran.  Doug Gilbert-Smith and Harry Arora have okay'd their people/locations.  DSM is complete.

There are only a few outstanding issues.  Power Services has been allocated 7 desks, however the names have not been placed; my understanding is the remainder of the team are located with the regions.  

I have not heard anything from Fletch, Dana Davis, or Suarez.  Don Black and Rogers have not emailed their changes, but LaDonna is working on it and said she'll put in as many churns as possible in this evening.  

Feel free to call me on Sunday if needed.
