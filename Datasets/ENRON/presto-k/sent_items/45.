My guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands.   The validation for East Power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day.   If there are gaps, please let me know.
 
With respect to vol curves, I am having Wang and Stalford go back and validate.

I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.
 
What time period are we validating?
