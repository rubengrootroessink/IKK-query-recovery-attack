Kevin:

Mark Haedicke is looking for an indication of the net settlement value to Enron from Calpine (apparently standard procedure for the settlement of lawsuits). David Portz is running the traps on this. I checked with risk mngt. to determine value of the cal '03 Nepool icap purchase. They couldn't find the deal. Can you give me a ballpark value ?
I'll be happy to pass the info. to Portz. 

Thanks
