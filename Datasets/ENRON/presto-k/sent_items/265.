You are right.   They are on crack.   This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin.   They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No. 2 oil.   Therefore, CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar.   The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk.

FYI.  CP&L is bidding for Nov-Dec'01, 5x16, into CPL-East, 100MW.  Bid $22 for Nov., and $23 for Dec.  I've seen trades in this area go for premiums to Cinergy and PJM, so I think they're on crack for showing this.  They have no offer.
