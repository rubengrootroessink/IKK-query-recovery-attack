Obviously, we will not deliver (or receive if we are long) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis.   Therefore, FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow.
 
Cory,
Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections.   Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from  the net position report as well.   We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday.
 
Jason - Please send to Cory (I was unable to from home)

Kevin, 

Please take a look at the attached spreadsheet.  I have updated to back-out TXU and FE, both of which are negative.  Is TXU an obligation to purchase power?  If you get a minute, let's chat about this.
