Rika,
The Callaway issue is kind of sticky.  Their condensate storage tank was clogged with debris.  They figured they may have other pumps clogged.  That's why they shut down and looked through the systems.  However, back when Cook first had its problems a few years ago, they started with debris clogging pumps.  The NRC is going to want to be sure there isn't any debris causing some backup system to be inoperable.
 
There is going to be a meeting on 2/27/02 at the site at which the Augmented Inspection Team will talk about the results of their inspection.  That should give an indication of restart.  Do you want me to attend?
 
Dan
