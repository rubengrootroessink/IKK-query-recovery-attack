Deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification.

Kevin, here is a request for curve access from Gas Structuring.  I'm working with Lloyd to have your name show up in the system for approval when anyone sends in an eRequest for curve access in the future.  I'll also highlight names on the current active list that don't sit on the desk or in power structuring for your review.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help manage/review the distribution of curve access.

- Jim
