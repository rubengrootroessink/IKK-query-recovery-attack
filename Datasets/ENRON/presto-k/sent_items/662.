Team,

I'm not sure what has been communicated regarding the enrollments.  I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status. 

The (5) packaged ice accounts were accepted by TXU and load availability was confirmed.  The 814 enrollment request will be submitted today/tomorrow by CSC.

The (28) target accounts were rejected by Reliant as the rate class is full. There is no load available.

Please advise if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca
