As reported in our last update, the NLRB ruled in favor of the Union, forcing Midwest to the table.
Negotiations start tomorrow (Wednesday).  This will be the first meeting.  
The second meeting is scheduled for Thursday.  After this, a more permanent agenda (meeting times and places) will be established by both sides.
The Union has established their list of "wants" in preparation for tomorrow's meeting.
By Friday the union will have the indications needed if meetings will continue.  
According to the Union:  Midwest is putting out false information which includes:  1) top individuals are on or have been on vacation and 2) that the Union has dropped all grievances.  Neither of these statements are true.
The matter between Midwest and Labor 15 is being handled out of the Chicago Regional Office of the NLRB or via the Peoria Sub-Regional Office.
