Please follow-up with this guy.   Looks like a retail load aggregator looking for wholesale supply.

I received this note from the EES Business Center.  The caller, John Grace, is interested in starting a retail electricity business and is looking for supply.  Can you pass this on to the appropriate person in your organization?  Or would you like me to follow-up.  His number is 713-662-3246.  Thanks.

Eric

Hi Eric,

I apologize for coming to you with this, but I don't know where to go to ask for assistance regarding a particular customer call I'd received in the Business Center.  I've capture the information in the print screen.  

Do you think you could help lead me to the appropriate person who can assist with this matter?

Thank you much,

Margaux
