I have been getting lots of requests from our friends.   I'm just giving you a heads up.   I have no problem with the URM group, unless, of course, they become part of EES.

Kevin -

The rest are EWS employees (URM).  I haven't even considered giving the others any access.

I am getting more like you every day.   Given what's going on in EES right now, I don't trust anyone.   Therefore, I am going to allow access to the portal to only EWS employees that you are comfortable with.   Obviously, this includes Dale.   With respect to the rest of the EES group, I am not going to grant access until the entire organization is doing the right thing for Enron's shareholders.

Rika -

Please grant Dale full access and the others should receive the scaled down version.  

Thanks,
Rogers

Full access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only.   We have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group.
