Kevin,

I know things are still pretty dynamic in the new organization, but I am ho=
ping I can speak with you about the possibility of any remaining power trad=
ing positions you might be looking to fill.  I know that several people wer=
e not retained in the NE, and my past Enron experience makes me a good cand=
idate to fill a trading role there.  I don't know if you remember me from b=
efore, but I spent time in Structuring as the lead Structurer for the UI de=
al, then Jim brought me over to work with Bill Reed and John Suarez on trad=
ing and marketing around the UI position in NEPOOL as well as PJM and NY (w=
hich had not really started trading at the time).  You and I never really h=
ad a chance to interact as we had no peaker assets in the regions in which =
I worked.  After EPMI I went to EBS, and most recently Jim asked me to go t=
o Singapore as the head of the trading and risk management function for our=
 Asia positions.  Currently I am working in the estate managing the termina=
ted power book for Racicot.

In early November, when it was only EBS that was on its way to shutting dow=
n, I was in discussions with Dana about re-joining the EPMI team.  It sound=
ed as if there was a definite need and Dana seemed eager to bring me back o=
n the team.  I realize everything has changed since then, though I am still=
 hoping I can fill a need.  I have been attempting to sit down with Dana to=
 identify current and near term needs, but we have yet to meet up.  I want =
to make sure that some random timing issue doesn't negatively impact my pro=
spects of securing a spot, so I am hoping that now maybe I can discuss with=
 you any opportunities.  If there are not opportunities, then that is valua=
ble feedback as well so that I can appropriately direct my job search post-=
estate.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
Fred Cohagan
