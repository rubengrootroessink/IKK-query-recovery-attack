Kevin and Rogers,

Pursuant to our brief conversations today regarding RAC's Market Risk Group involvement with EES, I have put together an org chart and a list of activities we are currently engaged in. A great deal of these activities are expectations of Rick Buy, however, many of them may be consistent with your expectations.

People:
Vlady Gorny		Overall responsibility
LaCrecia Davenport	EES East
Minal Dalia		EES West (in Portland)
Darin Schmidt		EES Deal Review
Scott Vonderhide	Contract Review (full-time)

   *all of the above individuals participate in the contract review on a part-time basis

Activities:
- Daily review and analysis of positions, P&L, VaR and Component VaR
- Review and evaluation of new deals
- Periodic review of curves
- Stress tests by region (NY, Illinois, etc.)
- Periodically review and analyze EES models
- Development of risk metrics for EES (regulatory, EAM, etc.)
- Ad-hoc analysis and projects (DASRing, CA issues, etc.)
- Consulting on risk management framework development
- Coordination between underwriting, structuring, RM and corporate RM
- Facilitate limit infrastructure
- Administer and ensure compliance with the Enron Corp. Risk Management Policy
