I sincerely appreciate your interest - and I really mean that - but I have made a verbal commitment to AEP and I think it would be dishonest of me to open up new discussions.  Who knows what may eventuate in the future but for the short term I'm pretty set in my plans.  Thanks again. 

Kind regards, Ron

Thanks for all the hard work and your efforts are greatly appreciated by
the power desk.   Is there any chance I can talk you out of your
resignation.   I would like you to come work for Lloyd Will and help with
our services business and RTO interface initiatives.

We are in the process of completely revamping our systems, and your
knowledge would be a huge help in pushing this initiative.   Your thoughts?

   Today at the Commercial Practices Committee (SPP) we voted to accept the
   draft real time market design for the "Day 2" market (i.e. 12/15/02).
   This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM.  As such it
   provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short
   10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule
   requirement.  Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the
   central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet
   to be determined).  Moreover, the SPP real time market will probably be
   implemented by MISO and is being looked at by GridSouth.  Overall this
   is a pretty good outcome for both Enron and the market in general.

   On a different note,  I provided Jim Steffes with my letter of
   resignation today.  I don't know whether or not I will be back in the
   office so I wanted to express what a pleasure it has been to work with
   (for?) you and the desk - I am very grateful for the confidence that you
   have shown in me.  My biggest regret is that the market design function
   didn't reside within your area of management rather than under
   government affairs.

   If I can ever be of any help please don't hesitate to contact me.

   Kind regards, Ron
