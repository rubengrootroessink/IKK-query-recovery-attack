Kevin,

I will fly to Austin ahead of the group for Barton Creek....I will be there ahead to make sure all rooms and activities have been taken care of.  I tried to put my flight on Dana's credit card and it would not work so I asked Julie to just put it on yours.  You will see a flight to Austin for me for $60.00.

Thanks...sorry for the inconvience.
