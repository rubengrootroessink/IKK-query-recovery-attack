Kevin,

Dana did a 2004-2006 deal on Friday at Zone G as follows:

Buy swap from Constellation 50 MW/Hr peak at $46.25 (deal #659636)


Also, as an FYI, he did a 2005-2007 deal at Zone G on Friday, as well, as follows:

Sell swap to EES 50 MW/Hr peak  at $49.75 (deal #659631) 


Let me know if you need anything else.
