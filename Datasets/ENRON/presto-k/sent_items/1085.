i'm going to be in houston monday-tuesday next week and would like to get together to talk about using our products in the new environment (ie, the new dynegy with generation assets).  the value proposition is different from before and i need to make some decisions very shortly regarding my contract.  you may know that EGM is being broken up and i need to decide where i am going to go.  i need to get your thoughts on that.

wednesday is a dead day so i gave my staff, including me, the day off.  please call me at 610-996-2522 on wednesday.  thanks.
