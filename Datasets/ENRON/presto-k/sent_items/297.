I am not going to make an into-GTC market.   I'm going to make an on the GTC market which is significantly different.   I do not want to educate the market on the difference.

Just so you see how others value GTC,  Dyn (Tamplen) is offered for 5x16, Cal'02 - '03 @ $2.50 above your SOCO offer.  Last we spoke about this, your bid was $0.60 over SOCO mid (approx. $0.35 over SOCO offer)--we're over $2 apart.  He's working on his bid for into GTC.
