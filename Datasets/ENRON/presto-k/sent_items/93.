Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition  Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami,  Florida

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading & marketing departments.

Ancillary  Services Conference

 

April  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.
