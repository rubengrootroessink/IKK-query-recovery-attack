I am interested in firm LD fixed price energy delivered at the Gannon bus-bar.   I have no appetite for unit contingent in the current market.   TECO has an entire system they can lean on.

I would consider bringing the gas, but you would have to involve Scott Neal's desk for transport and valuation becomes complicated.   With respect to volume, I would not want any more than 100 MW.

My strong preference is fixed price energy - no toll.   Volatility is getting smashed and it doesn't make sense to pay for vol in a spread option.  We are a much better bid for 5x16 or 7x24 energy.

Kevin,

As we discussed, TECO is offering up to 500MW (of a total 960MW) beginning 5/1/04 off the Gannon facility (which is being converted from coal to a gas-fired CC plant, called Bayside).  The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering is unit-contingent.  

TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other proposals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we bring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas supply, 3) fixed price call.  

I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficiency's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized, gas supply risk, etc.).

What is your preferred structure?  How many MW would you like to show a bid for?  Structuring ran an initial valuation for a 3-year, $35 daily call, 100MW.  Results are below.
