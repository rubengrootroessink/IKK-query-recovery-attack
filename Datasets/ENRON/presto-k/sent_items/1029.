Ok

I will work with the following assumptions:

Lateral move (title)
Salary (same as London converted to dollars?)
Start date: middle of November

Since I have not done one of these before, let me know if I am missing something.

Thanks.

Get him in the door.  Work with Kim Melodick in HR to make it happen.
