We have some serious issues.   Downgrade, collateral called, liquidity crisis, issue more equity.   I can see $12 pretty easy.

I think both Lay and Fastow are gone.

No problem.   The only problem right now is ENE's stock price.   Wow - you get em.

Kevin -

I was requested by Prof Webb to participate in an Energy Panel Discussion at UVA and have agreed.  Some of our competitors will be there and this will hopefully further our recruiting efforts.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Thanks,
Rogers
