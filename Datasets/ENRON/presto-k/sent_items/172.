I would not pay alot for this given the transmission issue.   The best place for park and lend is JEA.

Kevin,

New Smyrna is open to a Park/Lend arrangement.  I'm looking into transmission availability to and from New Smyrna currently.  They are interconnected with FPL and FPC.  Any interest in this location for a parking deal?
