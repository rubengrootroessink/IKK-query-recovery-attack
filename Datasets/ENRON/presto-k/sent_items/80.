Ron Green is the President of FPL Energy and Mark Maisto is the President of FPL Energy Trading (sub of FPL Energy).   I have Mark's contact info at home.   Send me an e-mail at kmpresto@hotmail.com and I can reply at home with his contact info.

You would be a great fit for their shop.

Do you have a contact at FPL?  I am curious as well as some others were thinking of giving them a call.
