Don't worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year.   It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron.   You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come.

While seemingly small in the scheme of things these days at Enron, on 12/14/01 EPMI did get a FERC win against MISO's proposed $1000 fee for each non-confirmed transmission service request for firm PTP of one week or longer.  FERC used our (In house written) argument almost verbatim!
