Sounds like he might fit in the LMP/transmission/congestion management group.   As I mentioned, we are attempting to create an Eastern Interconnect LMP model to model congestion in every region.   This will lead to the creation of hubs and basis markets.

Ravi might be a good fit for this group.

Kevin,

Here is the scoop on Ravi:

- He has extensive technical and financial modeling experience that would be an asset to the group.
- He would like the opportunity to using modeling (artificial intelligence, etc.) to realize arbitrage opportunities.  He has spoken to John Arnold and the crude desk about doing some variation of the above.  
- He is not ready to sit down in a trading seat day 1, however he is interested in getting to learn the commodity via research and modeling with the opportunity to move into trading.  

What are your thoughts?
