In the interim, Fletch and I will assume responsibility.   Obviously, we will be trying to identify a replacement over the next couple of months.

We will be doing some position re-alignment today - transferring some of Rogers positions to Fletch and/or myself at tonight's mids.   I will then re-sell/re-buy some positions back to Rogers which cancel out opposite positions in the retail book.

I will give you the specifics before we mark.
