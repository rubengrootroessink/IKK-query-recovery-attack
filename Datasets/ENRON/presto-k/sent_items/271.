Please grant full access to Dale Furrow in retail risk management.   Dale is a VP under contract and is a key member of the retail risk management staff.

With respect to the URM employees under Dale, please grant them the more limited access.

With respect to the EES employees (Ozzie, Beth, Greg Woulfe), I do not want any access granted at all.
