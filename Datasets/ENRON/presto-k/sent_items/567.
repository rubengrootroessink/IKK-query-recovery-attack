Hi Guys,

I'm sure Lavorato has mentioned to you the above presentation to be given, by your guys, to Lay and Skilling.  The first available date to capture both Lay & Skilling is Monday, July 30 @ 3:00 p.m.  Please advise if this will work for each of you.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor, EA to Greg Whalley
