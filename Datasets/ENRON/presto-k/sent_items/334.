The average guy has no idea what is coming.   T&D costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power (increased O&M, security, employees, capital improvements, risk premium, etc.)

Kevin -

UDC rates are going to increase significantly as we discussed.  FERC just gave ute's a go ahead for the recovery of prudent expenditures on safety/infrastructure spending and anticipated a significant amount of it.  

Amazing, we were just discussing this in am.
