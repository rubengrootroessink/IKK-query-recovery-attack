I will do Carson and Juan.   I am having Juan do all of his SE hourly group.   With respect to Forney, I will either do myself or have Doug do it.

Kevin -
 
I have prepared the following reviews for mid year:
Zurita
Decker
Wagner
Makkai
Ochsner
 
The following are still outstanding:
Acevedo, Rudy
Carson, Mike
Forney, John
Garcia, Miguel
Laurent, Mark Dean
Hernandez, Juan
 
As for Rudy, Dean and Miguel, I think Juan and Lloyd/Kayne are in the best situation to at least provide comments on these individuals.  I will be glad to prepare and have no problem doing so by the end of the week.  If you agree, we can forward to Juan and I will coordinate.
 
Re: Carson and Forney, Juan Hernandez - what do you suggest on these?  I can go either way with these - let me know.  I can easily do them, I just need some mid-year facts and recent obeservations.
