Hi Tim,
 
Thank you the phone message about your continued  interest in PIRA Energy Group. I look forward to hearing from you or Kevin  Presto about the PIRA analytical services you want to purchase for  your new business. (Kevin, I work for Allan Stewart in  PIRA's electricity group and also handle sales/marketing of PIRA's  services.)
 
Attached  is a description of PIRA's service offerings and an Excel file showing a  price matrix with annual fees.   Our base retainer service is for up to 10  users at one site (office location) under a site license agreement. One retainer  is $25,000 (e.g., natural gas), two retainers are $35,000 (e.g.,  electricity and natural gas) and three retainers are $40,000 (add  oil).  Fees for additional services such as emissions market  intelligence and the daily electricity demand forecast are shown to the right of  the main table. Clients with  users of PIRA's services in multiple offices can arrange a site license for  higher usage. 
 
Best regards, 
Victoria
