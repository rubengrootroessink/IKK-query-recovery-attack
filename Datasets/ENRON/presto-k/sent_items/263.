You can count me in.   We can have 3 hours of EES bashing.

Thanks.

Kevin -

I had the company tickets to the Tuesday, September 11 game against the Giants that was cancelled.  It will be re-played tomorrow evening.  I was going to see if you and Dale Furrow wanted to go (Berney is out of town) and maybe Lavo or Richter.  I think Bonds has 69 homers and very well might hit 70 tomorrow.

Let me know if you would like to join us.
