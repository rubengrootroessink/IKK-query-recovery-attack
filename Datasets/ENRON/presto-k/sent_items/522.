Terry,

Please set aside 30 minutes on my calender sometime next week to talk to Su=
zette.   I don't know her so your help in setting up the meeting would be a=
ppreciated.   Please coordinate with TJ Black (3-5800).

My conversations with Chris have been along the same lines - Personally the=
 modeling thing is a very minor concern to me.  That is only one component =
of what we are doing and, based upon what I have heard about Chris, he will=
 be able to pick it up quickly.  Obviously his mind is on other things righ=
t now but I am very comfortable that he would be able to add value to our e=
ffort.

In Suzette's case, again she obviously wants to develop her skill set but I=
 think she would be a good fit.  Tim, I agree with your point that Kevin mi=
ght be the right person to follow-up with her.

I spoke to Chris Ahn last Friday.  He left for his wedding and honeymoon on=
 Monday or Tuesday of this week.  He has two concerns.  The first is that h=
e doesn't want to flake on east power structuring.  I told him that Presto =
should be able to smooth that over.  The second one is that he isn't sure t=
hat he has yet developed the modeling skills that are necessary for this ty=
pe of heavy lifting.  He is smart and hardworking, but I personally haven't=
 witnessed his modeling skills nor does he have a "stamp of approval" via a=
 RAC, structuring, or Fundies rotation.  I suggested that he have a heart t=
o heart with Terry to assess whether his current skills are up to snuff.  T=
erry, have you had that discussion yet????  What is your independent assess=
ment of his capabilities????  As far as the Portland thing goes, I would ta=
ke Chris in Portland in a heartbeat.  If you would like me to call Suzette =
I'd be happy to.  Presto might be more effective since her alternative is a=
 rotation in east power.

Terry Donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence.=
  Could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefit=
s of joining this effort?

The pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the=
 EES and EWS organization, the exposure to the entire risk management proce=
ss from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the se=
nior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findi=
ngs.

This is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be a=
ppreciated.  Send me a mail if you intend to help. =20


Suzette Emmons - She had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is le=
aning towards the SE Power Origination group in ENA because she is looking =
for modeling and commercial experience.  I think she would be a good fit (a=
nd also might want to go to Portland) and would like to figure out a way to=
 get her.  She would be another good candidate for a phone call.

Chris Ahn - He had already committed to rotate through Power Structuring an=
d was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of=
 weeks.  He is reasonably interested in our opportunity (and following that=
 by going to Portland to work in Tim's group) but had concerns about walkin=
g away from his commitment to structuring.  By the time he left he was almo=
st ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more.  He is definite=
ly someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.
