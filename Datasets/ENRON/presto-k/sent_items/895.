thanks Vince.   I read about this in MW Daily and on Bloomberg.   I think it will be a good project.

Kevin,

Please, take a look at the link to the website
describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.

The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.

Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 


Any interest?

Vince

Vince,

Interestingly enough I have just spoken with Walter Coffer about an undersea project that Enron may be undertaking to take power from Canada to the New England area.  I'd like to talk with you about this when you have an opportunity.

Lance,

Who would be the right person on the trading desk to take a look at it?

Vince

Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Ed

Hello Ed,

It sounds very interesting. I forwarded your messages
to two members of my group who work on the problems related
to transmission (a key to the power markets successful
growth).

I shall share with you their  reaction.

I hope everything is going well.

Vince
