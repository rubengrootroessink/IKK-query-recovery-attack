We set a new west single book record with 206 trades in STCA.  We also set a new desk record with 611 for the day.  We launched an 8 hour block day-ahead product yesterday.  We have about 20 trades.  Ancillary service products are in the work.  Still grinding through contract language and EOL.
 
Did you know that Chris Mallory is an analyst, manages our STCA book, made $14 million in Q3, and is our leading EOL transaction trader?  Pretty cool!
