IMC Phosphate would like to sell us unit cont. power at their bus for December, 5x16., 13MW.  They are in TECO's service area.  We bought this from them in July and had full availability for all but 2 hours.  This was the transaction that Rogers took in his position but sleeved through your book.  Any interest here?
