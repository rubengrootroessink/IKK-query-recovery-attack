Yes I did and her response is below....she said she would put you on the waiting list.  Honestly, it doesn't look good...so I can check with our contact directly.

Let me know

Liz,

Kevin would like to know if Greg has any available tickets for the remaining games?  He would prefer a weekend however, if a weekday game is available that would be great.

Thanks for checking,
