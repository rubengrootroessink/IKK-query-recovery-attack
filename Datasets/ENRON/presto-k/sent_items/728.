After talking with Rogers, it sounds like a conference call at 1:00 pm tommorow would be more productive.   Rogers and Don are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues.

Does 1:00 pm tommorow work for you?   We can call you from my office.
