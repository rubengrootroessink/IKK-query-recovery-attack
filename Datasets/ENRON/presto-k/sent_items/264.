I will attend only if the whole group is represented (gas, oil, west power, and east power).   Once we have confirmation for all relevant parties, please let me know.

Kevin

As I said in a previous email , Joe Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures and Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC will be here Thursday afternoon through dinner to further our discussions for providing a hosted marketplace where Enron would stream products with wider bid/offer and smaller volume to their "retail" customer base.  

The purpose of their visit is to firm up our discussion so that we can start drafting a term sheet for the deal.

I have carved out 1 hour this Thursday Oct 4 from 4:30 to 5:30pm in EB 27C2 to discuss the products that we currently make markets in and the volumes Refco currently handles for their customers.

Would you or someone in your group be interested in attending?  Several of the guys from the Oil & Refined products group will be there and I am waiting to hear if John Arnold or a representative of his will attend.  Let me know.

Regards

John Cummings
