It needs to look like our wholesale reports (postions shown behind each utility).   In addition, peak and off-peak should be on separate pages.   We should have two views:

	1) By utility
	2) By counterparty

Kevin-

I agree; the format on the management reports leaves much to be desired.  

I have recently inherited the task of assembling and distributing the report.  As such I have decided to clean it up, and I have several ideas.

An outside opinion would be helpful so that I am am able to make the information which you need accessible.  As I know you agree with me that the format is poor I would appreciate some suggestions so that I can make the report better suit your's and others' needs.

Feel free to call me x.54282 (I'll be here until at least 6) or you can e-mail me.
