Will set up a meeting asap.

We have put money in the netco fundy budget with trey hardy to complete the new lmp project.  Looks like a 45 to 60 day effort once we have money approved by netco.

The rest will not be a big effort but we will be a little slower for new requests due to a shortage of IT staff. However the majority of our process's are fairly automated.
