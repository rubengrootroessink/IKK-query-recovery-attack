Kevin,

I currently work for Paul Racicot and support his trading organization in the areas of logistics and operations.  Paul asked me to send you a copy of my resume.  I am interested in meeting with you to learn more about Enron's power trading business and to discuss employment opportunities in ENA.

Enclosed in my resume.  I look forward to talking with you. 

Debra
