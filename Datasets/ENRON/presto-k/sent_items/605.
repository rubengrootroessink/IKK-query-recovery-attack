I cannot stop by this morning or early afternoon - - does sometime after 4pm work for you?

Let me know.

Jim and Paul know that I am interested in going back to power - - the only issue is when.  I would prefer that you and Jim/Paul agree to a schedule that works for both sides.

Let me know your availability.
