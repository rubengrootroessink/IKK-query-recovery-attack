Yes, you are correct.   Todd is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.

With respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes.  The only one with any significance is the counterparty name.   I expect Mitchell-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement.   Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.

I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.

The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.

Talk to you soon.
