Pushkar and Ellen Su are not SE Power offers.   They are offers for our interest rate books/FX books.   They should not fall under Power headcount.

While this explains the 29 open names, when added to the roughly 600 confirmed acceptances, it leaves us roughly 20 short of the approved headcount budget. I will follow up later today with a list of which groups will therefore start next Friday, under their headcount budgets.

Again to confirm, any of the above who do not accept prior to close of business Monday (Houston 5pm) will have their offers either pulled and/or start dates with UBS delayed probably to post February 16th.
