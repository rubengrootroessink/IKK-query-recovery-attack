I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.

He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.
