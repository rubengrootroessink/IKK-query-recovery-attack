Please drop by to give me an update.   Remember we need positions broken down by component (retail gen, reg gen, ancillaries, tariff, etc.) and positions by customer.   We also need P&L by component and by customer.

Thanks.

I would like for you guys to tell me what reports, etc., you will need from the NEW system to effectively manage your risks (what you need to be happy every morning).  We don't have to be all inclusive at this point, but it will help us to begin designing a systems framework to meet your requirements.  Don't hold back - feel free to dream.  Our IT department will tell us what can and can't be done.

There will be a meeting tomorrow (Friday) from 10:30 to noon in room 888 (Janet's old office) to discuss.  Let me know if you can't go.

Also, if I missed anyone who should be there, feel free to invite them.

Thanks
Todd
