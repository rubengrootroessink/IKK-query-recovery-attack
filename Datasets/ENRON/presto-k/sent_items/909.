Mr. Presto,
I just changed it for you. I went to the menu to the left of the page where
it says "Edit Portfolio". I then Changed the name at the top of the Edit
Portfolio page. At the bottom of the Edit Portfolio Page, I hit the "Submit"
button. Whenever you make a change, you then have to exit out of the
portfolio tracker(ie: go to home page) and then go back in.

Thanks,
Hank Emery

I am trying to change name to "Presto - Enron" and it won't let me.   How
do I change name?

   Portfolio looks good.   Is it valuing options properly?   Can you rename
   the portfolio "Enron"

   Thanks.
