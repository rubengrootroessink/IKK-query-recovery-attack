Here is some information that you probably are already aware of, but just in
case......

You may recall that Com Ed sold all of their coal-fired units and gas fired
units to EME (Edison Mission Energy). I don't remember exactly how many
megawatts are now owned and controlled by Mission, but it is between 15,000
and 20,000 MW throughout Northern Illinois.   Mission's union has authorized
a strike to be effective June 1.  Unlike Peoples, Mission does not have many
management employees in the Chicago area (Mission is a California-based
corporation).  Therefore the odds of the plants remaining in operation
during a strike are low.  They would likely keep a couple of key plants on,
and the rest would idle.

Power prices currently do not support operation of Allegheny or
Constellation, but a large outage may change that.  Bill Quigley has some
good contacts that have been keeping him up to date on the status of this.
If they strike we may see Allegheny, Constellation and Elwood fire even when
weather is not extreme.
