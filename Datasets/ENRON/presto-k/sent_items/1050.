I would treat it as business as usual.   If we are still having Associate/Analyst Super Saturday, we certainly can attend an energy panel discussion.

Kevin -

I think I recall metioning to you that I would be attending an energy symposium put on by UVA - date is next Friday.  Specifically, they asked me to participate in a panel discussion re: energy volatility, trading, and investment oportunities.  Other members of the panel will be:

Bryan Garnett - Williams NE power trader
Beau Taylor - VP Morgan Stanley
Rick Thatcher - VP Dominion

Other speakers include:

Paul Koonce: SrVP - Dominion
Jay Lukens - Lukens Consulting
William Utt - CEO Tractabel

ISSUE
What do you think about  my/ENE attending given the current press?  The Program Agenda has already been printed up and published.  I think bailing out may send a bad message, however, I would completely understand.  I think I can stay in the middle of the fairway and definitely avoid any inappropriate questions or discussions.  What do you think?
