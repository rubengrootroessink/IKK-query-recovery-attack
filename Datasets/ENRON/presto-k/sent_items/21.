Can he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am?   I can give him a quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets.   Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst. (TJ Black at 713-853-5800).
 
Thanks.

Russell would like for you to meet with him for an informational interview. An in person meeting would be preferable,

but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding is that he is not formally looking for a job

yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available within the energy industry. Erik is the son of

one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will try to get more color from Russell and forward it

to you.

What do you need from me?   Do you want me to meet with him?  talk to him

on the phone?   go to lunch?    is he looking for a job?    As you can see,

I don't have much information of the objective here.

   Kevin,

   It looks like Tuesday morning will work best for Erik.  I am supposed to

   meet with him at 9:00 am Tuesday morning, but

   am flexible if that time works for you.  Just let me know what time is

   ideal and I will schedule it with Erik.
