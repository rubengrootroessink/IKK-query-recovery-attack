Thanks Chris.   I agree with the approach.   It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything.

See you tommorow.

Guys,

I gave Louise  a"plan" which consists of trading list, transmission list, gant chart, org charts and your product descriptions.  I did not include any "strategy" or "volume targets" in the plan - my thought is we have a lot of work to do and we'll get after it.  I told her that the lists are works in process and will be modified or re-formatted since they will become our working tools for getting this stuff done.  Kevin,  I will be in Houston tomorrow if you want to review any of this.  Lists are unlikely to be perfect but they demonstrate that we have spent some time on this and we have a starting point.

Regards,

Chris Calger
