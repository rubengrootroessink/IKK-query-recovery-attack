See note below.   Upon confirmation from Portz, please remove Wabash from the non-termination counterparty list.

Kevin/Gerald: 

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.


David: 

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.
