Kevin:
 
I know we spoke about this few weeks back and you were realtively pessimistic about it.  However, it is my understanding that they have secured financing and so are now interested in seeing "tolling" bids for the output/optionality offered by this technology.   I assume you'd be relatively more interested in a tolling bid than actually providing capital.
 
I am overnighting to you a presentation they made at a bidders conference in Houston.  Also, attached below is a Q&A relating to the project.   I am on vacation Tues and Weds (and unfortunately unreachable -- fishing on a lake in NH ouside cell/pager range).  If you have an interest, perhaps you can pass along to Oscar Dalton or someone covering the ECAR region to pursue further.
 
I'll be checking my voicemails late afternoons tues and weds, so please leave me a msg if you want me to follow this up.
 
thanks
john

Attached, please find a copy of questions and answers on the Norton Energy

Storage project.  These, along with the materials presented during the

pre-bid meeting, address all of the issues that have been presented to the

Owners during the bidding process. To allow for adequate review of the

responses, the proposal due date has been extended.

PROPOSALS ARE NOW DUE ON FRIDAY, JUNE 1st.

Norton Energy Storage, LLC is very interested in receiving a proposal from

you.  Proposals could be unconventional, products that don't exist in the

market today but are worthwhile and of value in ECAR; conventional,

standard and existing products; and/or electric tolling.  This is a unique

plant and we are looking for forward-thinking, creative ideas.

If you have any further questions, please contact me as soon as possible.

Thank you for your interest in the Norton Energy Storage project.
