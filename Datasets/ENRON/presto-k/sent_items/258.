Yes,

Placed a call to him today to setup an interview.  Any times work better for you and the rest of the crew ( late afternoon or early morning 5:30am)?

Kevin,

I didn't work with Ravi directly, however I believe he is extremely well qualified based on his experience. He would likely be a good asset for the group however I do not know exactly in what role (perhaps mid marketing or orig. or as a quant/trader).  What I am not sure of is if he wants to trade.  I will talk to him today and will get back to you.

Folks Ravi looks like a real strong candidate that we should consider.

He could be helpful in the Ontario market as well.

Thanks.
