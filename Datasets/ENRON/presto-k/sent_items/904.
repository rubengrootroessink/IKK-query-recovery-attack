As soon as I get access to crude, resid, & coal curves, I will grant access to power curves.

Thanks.

Kevin:
As we work to improve to our fundamentals, one of things we'd like to include is off-peak prices. We have a weekly production / burn report . Can I have acess to these prices? Who should I contact?
Also can i have access to the power structuring model and curves?
Thanks
Jen
