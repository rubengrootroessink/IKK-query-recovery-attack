Please take a minute to review the attached update on our activities and assumptions in Wholesale Power Trading and Risk Systems.  As you might expect, most of our focus is on establishing independent NetCo and Estate operating environments.

The second attachment is simply an FYI.  It represents our current systems inventory (apps, hardware, developer software, etc...) for NetCo and Estate.

Glad to discuss... 

Steve
