Rob Kelter and Julie Lucas from Citizen's Utility Board (CUB) a residential=
 advocacy group in Illinois called me yesterday to discuss Enron's interest=
 in becoming a provider of last resort for Illinois residential customers s=
erved by ComEd.  As a result of the letter that ComEd sent to the ICC regar=
ding the PPO, etc, CUB has met with ComEd regarding the impact on residenti=
al customers.  ComEd has told CUB that they do not want to be the provider =
of last resort and also that their plan is to raise the residential rate hi=
gh enough to incentivize marketers to come and serve, a plan which is anath=
ema to CUB.

The bottom line is that CUB is either looking to pass legislation for munic=
ipal aggregation like Ohio or work out a deal with a supplier to be the POL=
R and take it to ComEd.  (While I don't know this for sure, I suspect we ar=
e the only marketer they have talked to since we were the only ones to expr=
ess an interest in talking further).  If that doesn't work, they want to fo=
rce ComEd into doing least cost planning for its supply.

Rob did not know what the unbundled generation rate is but said the all-in =
rate is approximately $.09/kwh.  Subtracting out t&d we could be looking at=
 a generation price to beat of approximately $.06/kwh. We would also need t=
o factor in the impact of any increase as a result of the DST case because =
under their filing, the rate increase applies only to customers who switch.=
  As part of any deal, we could argue to ComEd that the customers we take o=
n should be treated like bundled customers).  I have asked Marc Ulrich and =
Guy Sharfman for specifics as to the size of the residential load and the u=
nbundled generation rate.

The questions we need to discuss internally include:

1. Is this a deal we could do from a physical delivery standpoint?
2.  If yes, would we want to take on the entire residential load or just a =
portion, for example the residential customers of the City of Chicago).
3.  Is this an EES deal or is this an ENA deal in which we bring in New Pow=
er? =20

Your comments and thoughts would be appreciated.  At any rate this will be =
on the agenda for our ComEd strategy meeting on August 6 - see other emails=
.  Rob and I agreed to get back in touch the week of August 19th to discuss=
 further.

Janine
