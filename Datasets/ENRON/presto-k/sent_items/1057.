Very efficient CC gas units in Entergy and ERCOT are setting price.  Midwest and Plains has gas setting price 4-6 hours per day and coal the remaining 10 hours.   The NE markets (NY and NEPOOL) are the only markets with 10,000 HR gas units setting price across the entire peak.
 
Keep in mind that current temps are truly "no load" temps for East power (no heating or cooling demand).   The addition of new combined cycle units in our market have been destructive to forward heat rates.
 
Later.
