Kevin,

We have not met personnally however I was in the meeting a couple of weeks
ago where Accenture, Lloyd Will and Steve Nat presented recommendations
related to building systems capability to support East Desk trading growth.

I spoke to Lloyd today regarding his approach below for obtaining
additional business ownership associated with that plan. I wanted to see if
you had any specific business personnel in mind to be involved in this
process. If so, I wanted to pass that onto my guys to make sure they were
focused on getting the right people involved in the process.

Thanks for your input,

Phil Crosby
Accenture - Partner

      Assessment


I'm on the road and will not be available until next Tuesday at the
earliest.

For us to finish this work we need to have the front line customers in a
room for a day or two and review your initial findings.  So far accenture
has done all of the work with each of us in isolation and this has lead to
us being further apart rather than leaving us with a common vision to start
from.

I do not feel that accenture is ready for Kevin at this point however his
number is 713-853-5035 if you want to call him after 3:00 but I believe he
is out this Friday.  I'm available by cell at 713-806-6294 if you want to
discuss.

For both tracks below Enron needs to create our team that will own and
drive this work and this will take a little time as indicated in the
meeting.  What we need is for accenture to finish the initial evaluation
and work with us on the possible solutions and the effort required.  Once
this is done an Enron team will be able to review the report and costs to
complete our own evaluation.

The recommendations on what we do next will be coming from an Enron team.
For these projects to be successful we need to have customer commitment or
they will fail.

This was the initial intent of bring you in no more no less.

   Subject:  Accenture Plan to Refine Competitive Markets Trading
             Assessment

   All,

   Attached is a little more detail around the approach to refine the
   program
   plan associated with the Competitive Market Trading Assessment work.
   Please take a look and let me know if you have comments. I would like to
   begin execution of the plan next Monday when Mani Vadari and Mike
   Templin
   are in Houston.

   Essentially there are two tracks.

   1. Near Term Program Development - The first track involves reviewing
   the
   initial recommendations developed over the past weeks with the business
   and
   also confirming the near term capabilities/projects which they believe
   we
   need to focus on. The main objective here is to make sure we are in
   sync.
   with the near term business needs and are able to link the projects very
   specifically to those needs. I also want to make sure that the business
   buys into the initial recommendations and is able to articulate the
   benefits. If they don't we probably need to refine the recommendations.

   2. Confirm Longer Term Program - The second track is to reconcile the
   the
   longer term plan developed by the team with the near term priorities
   defined in Step 1, as well as break the longer term initiatives into
   more
   incremental components. I also wanted Mike Templin to investigate in
   more
   detail how the incremental EnPower Trading architecture migration would
   work (per Madhup's healthy scepticism).

   Lloyd, I wanted to make sure that Kevin is on board with this approach.
   Is
   it possible to set up a meeting tomorrow (Friday) with him to discuss
   his
   perspective?

   Regards

   Phil Crosby
   Accenture
