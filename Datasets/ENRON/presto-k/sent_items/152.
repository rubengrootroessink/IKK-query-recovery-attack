Attached are the 2002 preliminary plan expenses that were submitted.  To compose these plan numbers we used run rates derived from Sept 2000 YTD numbers.  The numbers that we calculated were numbers that could generally be derived from headcount.  We now have an opportunity to adjust for any expenses that you feel need to be included.  I will be bringing packets when we meet.


Thanks
