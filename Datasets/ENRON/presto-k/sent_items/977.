Mr. Presto,
I have the answer back from UBS PaineWebber on the reimbursement the fees
that you have been charged in the past on your options trades. Although I
did convince them to let us waive all future fees, it was pointed out to me
that it does say in your InsightOne Account Agreement under the paragraph
"Other Fees and Charges" that "With respect to aggregate trades of over
5,000 equity shares or 50 option contracts executed in the same security on
the same side of the market (buy or sell) on the same day, Client will also
pay $.02 per equity share on all shares over 5,000 and $2.00 per option
contract on all contracts over 50." Please give me a call if you have any
questions.

Thanks,

Hank Emery

I am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you
check into this problem.

I want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date
						Quantity
						Purchase Price
						Last Price
						Cost Basis
						Market Value
						Gain/Loss
						Gain/Loss%

Can you make this the default view setting.

thanks.
