There was a guy at Statoil/Eastern Group Chris, he may or may not be trading 
power.  There was also a guy at Western Resources Henry who seemed to know 
options pretty well, but they didn't give him much VAR.  I'll talk to a 
couple other people who might know if anyone good is looking around for a 
job.  You'll probably run up against the year-end problem hiring people until 
late Jan or early Feb.  I don't think I could leave after just four months 
up  here, but having an option book hedging out the deltas on EOL, vetting 
customer deals doesn't sound too bad.
