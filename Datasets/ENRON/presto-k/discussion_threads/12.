Rogers,

TVA's current bid is $4.75/kw-month, for the term May 1, 2001, through
December 31, 2003.  Enron could call on units not being dispatched by TVA
only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period.
If the AAF is equal to or less than 50% for a month, then the Demand Charge
for that month will be zero instead of $2/kw-month.

Having the potential of 72 hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each
month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low
guaranteed availability during the non-summer also reduces the value to TVA.

Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not
excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different
product such as unit capacity with LD energy, then that would increase the
value to TVA.

A transaction of this duration is subject to TVA Board approval.

Please let me know if the bid is acceptable, or if Enron want to offer a
product with higher availability.

Thanks,
Stuart
