Here is the information I sent to Karen Buckley on Kevin's preferences for 
the new analyst and associates starting in August.  Kevin's group has also 
identified several summer interns that they would be interested in as well.  
I will forward the names of those indiduals to you as soon as possible.  
Karen, please provide Louise and John with copies of the resumes Kevin's 
group selected for the summer interns.  Please feel free to contact me should 
you have additional questions.
