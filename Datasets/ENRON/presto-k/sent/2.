Below are the assumptions agreed for booking the New Albany spread option:

EPMI East Power Book pays New Albany a fixed demand charge for the next 5 
years as follows:

2001 $4.72/k/mo
2002 $4.63/kw/mo
2003 $4.54/kw/mo
2004 $4.45/kw/mo
2005 $4.36/kw/mo

As consideration for the demand charge, EPMI has the right to "toll" gas 
through the facility and receive power in return at a fixed heat rate 
conversion factor of 12.5 MMBtu/Mwh.   In addition EPMI will pay New Albany 
$1000 per start (for maintenance reserve fund) and $1.00/Mwh for variable 
operating costs.

The New Albany, LLC will receive an 8% return on capital.   Book value will 
be depreciated from $409/kW basis on 1/1/2001 to $336/kW on 12/31/2005.

The facility output assumption is 360 MW with a 95% availability in the 
summer and 75% availability in the winter.

Jenny - Please revise the booking of New Albany in Rogers book effective 
tonight.

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.
