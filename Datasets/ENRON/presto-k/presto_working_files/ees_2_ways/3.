Detailed below are the project teams identified in yesterday's meeting.  We would like to run these by Greg asap to begin pulling them together and wanted to run this current list by each of you.  We specifically wanted to make sure that you felt we would only be requiring Greg to go get Deirdre, Heather, Jim and Kristen from other business units.

Please let us know by the end of today if you have any additions or deletions to this list.

Thanks

Wade
