Recapped below is the latest list of team participants based on the feedback 
provided.  I highlighted those that attended the kick-off meeting today.  Are 
the others still to be contacted, or is this the complete team?

There was some discussion at the meeting as to whether we needed to move 
these people to a separate cost center.  Berney is following up, but in the 
meantime I will get one set up as part of Don and Rogers' organization moves 
and we can populate it later if we want to.

Thanks

Wade
