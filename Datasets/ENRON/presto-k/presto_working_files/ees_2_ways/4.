Misty,

Can you please send the cc'd individuals above the complete contract review questionnaire for their review and information.

Also, can you have a brief (15-30 minute) meeting set up with Berney Aucoin and Vladimir Gorny to walk through the database functionality as it exists today.  It will probably be several weeks before that aspect of the project if more fully addressed, but I want them to at least be familiar with where we are today and what additional questions we might have about functionality.  You should probably make sure that the IT programmer is present at the meeting.

Thanks

Wade
