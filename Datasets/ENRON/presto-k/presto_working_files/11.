Morning Joe,

Just wanted to see if we have credit issues. APB was told "No Enron" by
Tom Wettloffer this morning. I was unaware we had issues so I spoke with
our credit guy Ed Sachs. Ed said he spoke with your credit guy and we
were ok but may find some deals subject to credit verification. Just
wanted to see if that is the same word you guys know. Our Nepool guy
sees you but our NY guys don't. Let me know if I need to get on our
credit dept to straighten things out. Thanks.

Rob
