Ann,

	Here's the item for the weekly staff notes:

	
	Transwestern Pipeline Company

	Richardson Products Co.: Transwestern has not received payment for Richardson Products Co. for the outstanding invoice for November in the amount of approximately $1,600,000. Richardson Products Co.has stated that it is withholding payment on the basis that it seeks to recover from Transwestern (by offset) amounts that it is owed Enron North America Corp. Transwestern will send Richardson a letter demanding additional security for payment of the outstanding amount and future amounts that become payable.
