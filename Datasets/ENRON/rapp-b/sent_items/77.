At one point, we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container. I worked on this with Erin Stus. We came up with a draft that I was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my Consolidated Container file on the j drive. If you can't find it there, give Erin a call. She should still have a copy.

Were you working on a Bill Management Agreement form that was final or near final?
