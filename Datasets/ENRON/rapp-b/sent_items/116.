	Deborah,

		The latest commodity agreement amendments were not yet filed in the binder. (They were signed right before I left.) However, I gave those to Raquel as well, so you should have them. As I mentioned this morning, Maureen Palmer also has copies.

Raquel has the OWC binders  but I do not see the signed commodity agreement amendments there. Where are those located?
