A meeting to discuss Transwestern's position in SoCal's BCAP proceeding has been scheduled for Tuesday, November 6, 2001 from 1:00 - 3:00 PM in Conf. Rm. 1336 in Houston.  Dan Douglass and Gregg Klatt will also attend to review their memo on both SoCal and SDG&E's BCAP applications.  If anyone needs another copy of either the memo or the applications, Blair and I have copies for distribution.  gh
