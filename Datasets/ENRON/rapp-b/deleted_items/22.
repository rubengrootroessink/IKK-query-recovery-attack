A law practice, like every professional service business, has goodwill. In
1991, the ABA's Model Rule 1.17 gave meaningful value to lawyers; currently,
more than 30 jurisdictions permit the sale and purchase of law practices.

Join our expert faculty as they discuss the implications of the Model Rule
and issues you need to consider when buying, selling or combining law
practices, including:

The Panel will include:
Lee S. Kolczun, Moderator Colella & Kolczun P.L.L, Lorain, OH
Speakers:
Ellen R. Peck, Law Offices of Ellen R. Peck, Escondido, CA
Edward Poll, Edward Poll & Associates, Inc, Venice, CA

Issues that will be covered:
- How to determine the value of your practice
- How to determine the price you are willing to accept or pay for the law
practice
- Preventing the seller from competing with you after a sale of his/her
current operation
- Seller's psychology -- watch out for the trap!
- Payout or Cash out and other factors that impact your price
