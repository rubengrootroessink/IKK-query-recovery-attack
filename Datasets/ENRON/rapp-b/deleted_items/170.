Dynegy Issues Statement On Enron Merger Status
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 21, 2001--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news) Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson today said he is encouraged by 
Enron Corp.'s report this morning that it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the assets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and 
has received a commitment from its lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in Enron's recent 10-Q filing. 

``We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance
 with the previously announced agreement,'' he said. 

Watson also noted that ChevronTexaco recently reiterated that it has ``full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the 
merger and to build a new company into an industry leader.'' ChevronTexaco owns 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.
