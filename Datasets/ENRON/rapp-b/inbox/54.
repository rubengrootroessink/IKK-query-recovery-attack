It will be here July 5 through August 25, 2002.  This is a must see event.  If enough of us want to go (must be at least 20) I I can coordinate a group and hopefully, get us really good seats at a bit of a discount.  I plan to shoot for a Sunday matinee.  Meanwhile, I'm going to get exact ticket prices, etc.  I do know that this event is in great demand and that the orchestra tickets range from approximately $78 to $131.  I will also get prices for other parts of Jones Hall.

Also, I am planning to look at Sunday dates in August.

Be so kind as to shoot me an e-mail so that I'll have an idea how many tickets would be involved.

Thanks,

I
