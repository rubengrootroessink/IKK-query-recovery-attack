Bill,  

FYI--below is the testimony we filed in regard to supporting SoCal's proposed interim solution last summer to Windowing.  Then on Nov. 1, they effectively eliminated windowing and filed the Advice Letter I forwarded to you a few minutes ago.  In the event we decide to file comments in the Advice Letter proceeding I thought you might like to see this testimony.  gh
