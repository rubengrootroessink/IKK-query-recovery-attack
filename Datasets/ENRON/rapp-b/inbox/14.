Bill, you will be migrated to our LAN Tuesday night and be able to access the ETS Lan & Microsoft Outlook on Wednesday morning.  They told me you should be able to access Outlook on the EES LAN Monday and Tuesday until then, so hopefully you won't miss any messages.  I'm taking a vacation day tomorrow but will be back Monday, so if you have any questions or problems tomorrow, please call Denise Lagesse at 3-6704 or Ruth Mann at 3-3595 and they can help you....See you Monday!!!!
