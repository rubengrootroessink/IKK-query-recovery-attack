Please include the following paragraph in the TW regulatory matters Note:

On July 16, 2001 Transwestern was authorized to abandon and replace certain compressor station facilities located in Arizona (Red Rock Expansion).  The new compressor facilities will create 150,000 Mcf per day of incremental firm capacity on the western portion of Transwestern's system which terminates at the Arizona/California border.  Transwestern estimated the cost to abandon the existing units to be approximately $.4 million, and the cost to install the new units to be approximately $92.9 million.  The proposed in-service date for the Red Rock Expansion is June 1, 2002.
