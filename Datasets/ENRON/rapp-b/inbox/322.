I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Bill, attached are a few comments/questions on your proposed draft answer, which I thought was excellent.  We might want to discuss some of these questions with the ccs.  Thanks, Maria
