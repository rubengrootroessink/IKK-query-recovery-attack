Jan,

Can you make this change to the form.
Since Bill signed the original, have him sign the revised form.
The date of his signature should be the same.
We are just changing the company name to keep our records straight.
Also, please save Miranda's e-mail in the "Reports" folder.\
Thanks!

Frazier
