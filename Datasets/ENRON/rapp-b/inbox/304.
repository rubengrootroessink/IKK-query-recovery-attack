Subject: RP97-288 Brief Opposing Exceptions


The attached draft responds only to Staff's brief, except for a few
arguments.  Because Staff has made detailed arguments as to the evidence,
this draft provides a detailed response to correct the record.  I will add
responses to CPUC and Indicated Shippers over the weekend.
