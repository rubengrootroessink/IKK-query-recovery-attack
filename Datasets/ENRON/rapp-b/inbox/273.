Tracy,

Can you go ahead and add Louis P. Soldano to the NNG org chart.
He will be VP and Assistant General Counsel reporting to Drew.
While the effective date is the same as the date for Kevin, the date on the charts should be today's date.
(We always use the date of posting for the "Updated" date.)

Also, please add a job description for Lou to the Job Description posting for NNG.
There is already a job description for him on the TW posting.
Just use that description.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.
Thanks.

Frazier
