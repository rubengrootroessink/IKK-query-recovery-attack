GAS BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING----NOVEMBER 26, 2001

An introduction to the gas industry that will address the issues that face the team daily.  Players in the market, supply/demand and many other factors are examined, including the various markets across the U.S.  The day culminates with a real-life marketing simulation. Using business concepts learned throughout the course, participants compete against each other to market their gas supply to a California electric generator.   And just as in the real world, teams can ultimately either strike it rich or lose their shorts!
