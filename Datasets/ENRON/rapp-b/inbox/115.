Jan,

Hope you had great Holidays and will have a Happy New Year!

When you get back, please fill out forms for all of these transfers.
None are from a marketing affiliate, so we do not have to send advance notice to the ETS Solution Center or give them an initial interview/training.
When you give the forms to me, I will sign and date them as approved as of today.
Don't forget to copy the elecronic versions of the forms to the "Transfer" folder.
You will have to create a new subfolder for 2002.
Also, please save Tracy's e-mail to the "Reports" folder.
The name of the saved document should include the last names of all five transfers.
Thanks!!

Frazier
