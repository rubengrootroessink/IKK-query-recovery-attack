Subject:	Red Rock Expansion Station 4

This is to confirm our conversation today, the Transwestern Red Rock expansion currently is scheduled to replace the existing units at Station 1, 2, 3 and 4 with a new unit at each station.  Due to market conditions, Marketing and Operations have agreed to officially remove Station 4 from the Red Rock expansion.  We will need to prepare (overhaul) the existing units at Station 4 to flow the new incremental 120 mmcf/d.
With this information Environmental Affairs can withdrawal the air permit application for Station 4 and Regulatory Affairs can make necessary filings.
Thanks for your help.
Dan
