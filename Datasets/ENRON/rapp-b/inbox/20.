Lexis won't allow ID to be transferred from one group to another.  I'll request a new ID for Bill Rapp under your group and cancel his EES ID.

Sylvia, we have a new attorney from EES Legal ( Bill Rapp) starting in our group on October 22nd.  Will he need a new ID & Password set up with Lexis?  He probably has one already under EES Legal but I wasn't sure how that works.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.
