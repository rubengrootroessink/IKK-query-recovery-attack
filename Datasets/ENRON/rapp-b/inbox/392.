Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.
