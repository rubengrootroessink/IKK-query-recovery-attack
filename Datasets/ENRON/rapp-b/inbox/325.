	Bill Rapp, an ETS attorney, has asked that we do a  Law Manager database search to determine whether David Foti shows up as a party or otherwise.  Mr. Foti is apparently being considered as a consultant by ETS.  Could you please run a search and reply by e-mail when you are finished?  Thanks.

	Britt
