What about the access to the 50,000/d of new capacity at Needles that was being constructed? Wasn't that part of this proceeding? SoCal had argued that it would go to TW (we needed it for Red Rock).

Subject:	SoCal Unbundling

At yesterdays CPUC meeting the Commission approved on a 3-2 vote the Comprehensive Settlement we supported to unbundle the SoCal system.  This includes open access to their backbone system and receipt point procedures we supported.  I'll distribute the final order as soon as its available with the effective dates and details.  gh
