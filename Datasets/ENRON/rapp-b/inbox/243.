Charlie, nice job.  Your idea to call Midland later in the week is a good plan: we obviously need to stay on top of this.  Let us know if we can help.  Greg

Mark Knippa talked to Roger Wieck (Midland Power Cooperative) this morning and let him know that he should be receiving payment of at least October's (approx.. $88k) past due electric bill yet this week.  Mark also was to let him know that ENA plans on continuing to operate and pay the electric bill into the future.  Mark will follow-up later this week to see if the payment was made.  If I don't hear from Mark or Midland by Wednesday or Thursday, I will check with Midland to see where things are.
