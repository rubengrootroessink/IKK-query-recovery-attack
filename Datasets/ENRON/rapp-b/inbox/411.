Jan,

Can you try you hand at processing these two transfers.
Work with Janet.
The transfer affiliate is not a marketing affiliate.
When you complete the forms, give them to Bill to sign.
File the completed hardcopy in the library/fileroom.
File the completed electronic copy in the appropriate file.
Call if you have questions.
Thanks.

Frazier
