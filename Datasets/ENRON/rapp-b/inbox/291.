Great to hear from you.  To be sure, it's jazz, not classical.  I've
still got some growing to do.  I think of you every time I put on The
Essential Stan Getz (sp?).  Great recommendation.  I've bought some Nina
Simone lately -- most recently Best Of and Blues.  
 
I did see Run Lola Run -- great movie.  Haven't been going to the movies
a lot lately b/c of Alex (my new son).  It's a fair trade though.  I'll
pick up "Momento" next time I'm at Blockbuster, and check out the
classical discs you recommended.  
 
Work is good -- I'm not sure if you know what we do -- we buy people out
of their lp interests before the term of the partnership.  Esentially,
providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market.  There's a lot of
crap on the market these days, but every now and then you get someone
selling good interest too.  It's mentally stimulating and professionally
accretive, so I'm very happy.  Thanks again for the referral -- that was
very helpful in making it all happen.
 
Well, I'll scan my recent disc purchases to see if there's any other
buys I think you ought to put on your list.
 
All the best,
Mark

Mark,
 
        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been
a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and
actually think that things areb eginning to stabilize. 
 
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called
about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to
be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You
definitely made the right decision to leaveS tratum. As you've probably
heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to
liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and
about the same number in Houston. 
 
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas
77024. 
 
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah,
in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly
recommend them: "Run Lola Run" (German with English subtitles) and
"Memento" (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I
remember correctly, you like classical music, so you mighte njoy Murray
Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care.

Bill: 

Been thinking of you a lot lately.  I hope that you are well in light of
all of the enron news.  

I wanted to send you something via US mail.  I know that you bought a
house about 1+ years ago, but I don't have your coordinates.  Can you
send them along?

Thanks, Bill. 

Mark
