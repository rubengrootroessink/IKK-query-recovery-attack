*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Please plan on attending a (short) meeting on Friday (11/16) at 8:15 to discuss our strategy for Station 4.  As you know, Marketing and Operations have determined that Station 4 will not be installed under the Red Rock docket.  They have requested Environmental withdraw the application for the air permit, which I believe they are currently working on.  The overhauls for the existing three units are currently scheduled to begin in March 2002.
