Subject:	BCAP Meet & Confer


The meet and confer in the SoCalGas/SDG&E 2003 BCAP was held as scheduled in San Francisco this morning.  Anticipating that today's meeting would be short and not very substantive, we decided I should participate by phone.  That turned out to be the right call, as the meeting was over by 10:15 a.m. and primarily focused on procedural matters.
 
The meeting started with SoCalGas giving an overview of the company's application, as well as the embedded cost study and revised testimony filed yesterday.  SDG&E then gave an overview of its application (SDG&E will file its embedded cost study shortly).  Both SoCalGas and SDG&E noted that they may need to submit revised BCAP applications if and when the Commission takes action in the Gas Industry Restructuring ("GIR") proceeding, the Combined Core Portfolios application, and other pending gas proceedings.  Most significantly, the Revised Proposed Decision in the GIR approves most of the proposals covered by the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (e.g., establishing a firm receipt point rights program).  If the Revised Proposed Decision is adopted, that would significantly narrow the scope of the BCAP.            
 
Next the parties discussed the procedural schedule.  The Office of Ratepayer Advocates ("ORA") started things off by claiming it could not possibly have its "reports" on the BCAP applications (actually direct testimony) ready before mid March.  The rest of the discussion dealt with trying to fit the rest of the schedule in between ORA's testimony and January 1, 2003, the scheduled start of the next BCAP period.  The result is as follows:
 
Nov. 27        Pre-hearing conference statements
Dec. 04        Pre-hearing conference
Mar. 22        ORA direct testimony
Apr. 19        Interested parties direct testimony
May 10        All parties rebuttal testimony
May 16        Second pre-hearing conference
May 21        Hearings (up to 4 weeks)
July 19        Opening briefs
Aug. 09        Reply briefs
Nov. 12        Proposed decision
Dec.  28        Final decision           
 
The meeting ended at that point.  
 
We are reviewing SoCalGas' embedded cost study, etc., and have started contacting the noncore parties to get their take on things.  We will prepare a memo reporting the results of same. 
 
Best regards,
