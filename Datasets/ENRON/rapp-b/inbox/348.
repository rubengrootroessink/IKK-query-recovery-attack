Bill,  I'm OK with the new draft.  In regard to cc's to Commissioners, we should send copies if that's the typical method for filing these types of comments.  Otherwise I don't want to overly offend SoCal by sending something direct if its not the usual filing process.  Thanks.  gh

Here's a revised draft of the letter to the CPUC re SoCal Gas' "windowing" proposal. This incorporates the comments of Lindy and Terry and also some editorial changes. We need to file this tomorrow, so I would appreciate receiving any comments by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Thanks.

Bill, attached is a third draft which contains the revisions we just discussed.  Let me know tomorrow if it is acceptable, as well as whether TW wants to cc the Commissioners.  Thanks!
