I would agree, as long as the payment was before Jan 1, so that they would be current before the next month flows began.    To the extent that they are not current then they do not meet the creditworthiness standards.     So as a solution to the whole thing, they pay on monday and we will forget the bad credit issue.    They pay after that and they are reported as a late payor/non-creditworthy.   It's at least a choice for them to make.

I've made a few changes as marked.  We should talk about whether or not we will accept immediate payment for the Nov. bill sufficient to bring them back to credit worthiness for their ongoing business or require them to provide additional security or Letter of Credit.  Comments?

Kim

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a letter to Richardson Products Co. demanding security or payment of the outstanding invoice.
