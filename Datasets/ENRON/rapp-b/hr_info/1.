Bill, I tried the password and it wouldn't work....would you mind calling the ISC Call Center at 713-345-4727 and ask them to reset your password for your XMS Concur Expense login.   They will email it to you or tell you on the phone....the one you gave me was for  eHRonline with your P00507086 ID and they did make me change houston to goodnight, unfortunately your XMS password is not synchronized with SAP, eHRonline, iPayit or iBuyit.
