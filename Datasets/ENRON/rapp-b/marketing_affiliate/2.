Martha,

As we discussed today, it is OK to leave Derrick on these boards.
None of these companies are marketing affiliates.
Moreover, none of the officers and directors of these companies are officers or directors of any of the companies in the marketing affiliate groups of companies (i.e., ENA, EES and LNG).  (See, attached Corporate Data Sheet.)
Please call if you have any other questions.

Frazier

Frazier,

I know you are very busy and I apologize for having to contact you regarding this, but it was suggested to me today by Lance Schuler, that I should check with you (once again) regarding Mr. Derrick's serving on the Board of Directors of the Bermudian insurance companies in Global Risk Markets.  These are not marketing affiliates.  We have discussed this before, and you had no concerns with Mr. Derrick serving on these boards.

Please advise when you get a moment.  Thank you.
