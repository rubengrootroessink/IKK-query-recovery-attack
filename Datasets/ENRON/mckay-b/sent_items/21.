Brad,
 
Hi, I just wanted you to know I was thinking about  you.  I know things will all work out. You are such an awesome  person....there is some company out there that is going to be so lucky to have  you....your great character, ethics, intelligence, personality, faith and of  course your good looks is something no one can pass up!!! I am thinking about  you and I love you!
