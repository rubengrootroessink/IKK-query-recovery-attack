I am writing this email to express some concern that I have that has
been gnawing at me over the past week.

It is a concern over a feeling that each of us is having.  It's a
feeling of having too much to do.  Too much practice, too much homework,
too much football, too much baseball, too much of everything!

I caught myself recently telling someone about our kids schedules in an
exacerbated way and after completing my sentence it hit me.  What I
realized was that I was complaining about something that was probably
one of the most wonderful "problems" that a parent or child could have.


To have children that have the ability to play sports, the opportunity
to excel in school and have parents that care enough about them to
support all that they do is a true blessing, not a problem.  I am sure
that there are hundreds of thousands of kids in this city alone that
would pay money to trade places with each of us.

I have found a poem that I wanted to share with each of you that I think
says a lot.  To me it says that we should be setting an example for our
kids.  Encouraging their hard work at school and in sports, not
discouraging it through negative comments about having too much to do.
If we all as parents start to "talk-up" school, practice, football,
baseball, etc. about how fun it is and how great it is to be with such a
great group of kids, the results will be amazing!

Little Eyes Upon You

There are little eyes upon you
and they're watching night and day.
There are little ears that quickly
take in every word you say.
There are little hands all eager
to do anything you do;
And a little boy who's dreaming
of the day he'll be like you.

You're the little fellow's idol,
you're the wisest of the wise.
In his little mind about you
no suspicions ever rise.
He believes in you devoutly,
holds all that you say and do;
He will say and do, in your way,
when he's grown up just like you.

There's a wide eyed little fellow
who believes you're always right;
And his eyes are always opened,
an he watches day and night.
Your setting an example
every day in all you do,
For the little boy who's waiting
to grow up to be like you.
