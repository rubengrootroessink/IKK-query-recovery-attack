Brad,

I talked with Keith friday afternoon about the TCO map.  After 1:00pm friday, their server went down, and they couldn't access any of the files or save the changes to the Map.  He told me that if all goes well Monday morning, we can see a map a little after noon.  I will work with him Monday morning to make sure I can have it for you asap.  Right now the map includes current day and yesterday's information for the relevant market delivery zones.  During next week, I will add interconnects to the map as well a storage fields to present a complete picture.

Thanks,

Adam
