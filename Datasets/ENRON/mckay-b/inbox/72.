HOW TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE 
> > 
> >   1. Throw out nonessential 
numbers. This includes age, weight and 
height. Let the doctor worry 
about them. That is why you pay him/her. 
> > 
> >   2. Keep only cheerful friends. 
The grouches pull you down. 
> > 
> >   3. Keep learning. Learn more 
about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never  
let the brain 
idle. "An idle mind is the devil's workshop," The  
devil's name is 
Alzheimer's. 
> > 
> >   4. Enjoy the simple things. When 
the children are young, that is all that you can afford.  
When they are in  
college, that is all that you can afford. When you are  
on retirement, that  
is all that you can afford! 
> > 
> >   5. Laugh often, long and loud. 
Laugh until you gasp for breath. 
> >   Laugh so much that you can be 
tracked in the store by your 
> >   distinctive laughter. 
> > 
> >   6. Tears happen. Endure, grieve, 
and move on. The only person who 
> >   is with us our entire life, is 
ourselves. Be alive while you are 
> >   alive, don't put out a mailbox on 
the highway of death and just wait in residence for your  
mail. 
> > 
> >   7. Surround yourself with what 
you love, whether it is family, 
> >   pets, keepsakes, music, plants, 
hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge. 
> > 
> >   8. Cherish your health. If it is 
good, preserve it. If it is 
> >   unstable, improve it. If it is 
beyond what you can improve, get help. 
> > 
> >   9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to 
the mall, the next county, a 
> >   foreign country, but not to 
'guilt country'. 
> > 
> >   10. Tell the people you love, 
that you love them, at every opportunity. 
> > 
> > 
> >   Life is not measured by the 
number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take  
our breath away.
