Marc,
We have not met but I purchased John Clinch's unit about two months ago.  I
wanted to contact you to get your input as to my situation.  Currently, I
have three issues with my unit.

1. The granite has not been installed.  The back splash in the kitchen and
bathroom is not in.
2. The mini blinds are not in.
3. Most of my punch list has been completed but a few items are
outstanding.  These are of less importance that the first two items and I
realize that I got into the unit late so the crew could be behind.

I have already paid for the granite and its installation.  Can you give me
an update as to where we stand on getting this completed as it is the
largest outstanding item.

John asked for payment on the last cash call but I have a problem in that if
these items are not going to be completed, it will cost me approximately
$2500 - $3000 to replace the items, which I have already paid for.  I would
like to get everything settled and move forward.  Can you give me some
information about the above and your recommendation.

Thanks
Tim
