Dear Brad Mckay,
Qualified Orders Filled in 10-Seconds or 
Less - or They're Free!
Time is money. Nowhere is that more true than in
executing your stock trades. Because in just a
second, the price you thought you had can change.
And that can cost you money. That's why we're
introducing the Ameritrade 10-Second Guarantee.
That's right! With the Ameritrade 10-Second
Guarantee, qualifying S?100(R) Internet equity
market trades that take longer than 10 seconds to 
execute are commission-free! (some limitations
apply)* 
How can we guarantee such speed? Our proprietary
order routing system lets us dynamically
distribute orders to multiple market centers to
seek best execution. This routing system gives you
a premium combination of speed, price and
liquidity that has enabled us to receive execution
on 99.5% of our trades at or within the National
Best Bid and Offer.**
To learn more about our 10-Second Guarantee and
our proprietary order routing system, visit us at:http://www.ameritrade.com/o.cgi You deserve the best combination of speed, price,
and access to liquidity from your broker. With
Ameritrade you can rest assured that's what you
get!
Sincerely,
J. Peter Ricketts
