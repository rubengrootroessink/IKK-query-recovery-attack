Brad:   this is just a test e-mail re Port O'Connor.  I have added you
to the list now that I have your e-mail.  I hope Tim has sent you some
of the earlier stuff so you will be up to date.  We are trying hard to
wrap up the accounting with Marc Deer so we can start conveying
individual units.  Deer promises to do all the punchlist items.  If you
have anything that's bugging you, call Marc.  You should also be getting
by mail a letter from the condo association board about THE RULES, which
should give you some flavor for where we stand now.
Welcome to the club, I look forward to meeting you and doing some
fishing.

John Wallace
