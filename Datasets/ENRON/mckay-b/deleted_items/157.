We, at Care Net Pregnancy Center of Houston, want to share the good news
of what God did through our 9th Annual Golf Scramble a few weeks ago!

Through our underwriters, golfers, and donors, over $75,000 was raised for
the growing ministry of Care Net!  100% of this record amount will go
directly to our center.  As our vision in Houston expands with a new
center opening in northeast Houston soon, it is exciting to see God
provide for our needs.

Our top fundraiser this year was Cliff Holloway who raised almost $5,000
from over 40 sponsors.  He and his wife will be enjoying a trip to
Colorado for a 2 night stay, including rounds of golf, at The Broadmoor
Resort and Spa.

We hope you will all be able to join us next year for another fun day of
golf.  We want to thank YOU for the blessing you are to this ministry!  At
the end of this note, we also have a list of our generous contributors
toward our many prizes.  We encourage you to support them too!

Sincerely,

The 2001 Golf Committee
