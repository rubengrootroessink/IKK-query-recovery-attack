Hope  everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving.
 
Please take a moment to relax your  mind and humble your heart to 
focus on Christ. Allow God, to be the only  person on your mind 
while you read this prayer. If we can take the time to  read long 
jokes, stories, etc., we should give the same respect to this  
prayer. Friends that pray together, stay together. 
Dear Lord, 
I  thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see 
and to hear  today.  I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God 
and an  understanding God. You have done so much for me and You 
keep on blessing me.  
Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought 
that was  not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness. 
Please keep me safe  from all danger and harm. Help me to start 
this day with a new attitude and  plenty of gratitude. Let me make 
the best of each and every day to clear my  mind so that I can hear 
from You. Please broaden my mind that I can accept  all things. 
Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.  
And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example 
-to  slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when 
I'm  pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, 
You listen to my  heart. Continue to use me to do Your will. 
Continue to bless me that I may  be a blessing to others. 
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. 
Keep  me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for 
others. 
I pray  for those that are lost and can't find their way. 
I pray for those that are  misjudged and misunderstood. 
I pray for those who don't know You intimately.  
I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it with 
others.  
I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I 
believe.  
I believe that God changes people and God changes things. 
I pray for all  my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in 
their  households. 
I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that they are out  of 
debt and all their needs are met. I pray that every eye that 
reads  this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater 
than God.  
Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight. 
I pray that these words  be received into the hearts of every eye 
that sees them and every mouth that  confesses them willingly. 
This is my prayer.  In Jesus' Name, Amen.  
If you prayed this prayer, change the number in the subject box 
before  forwarding the message so people can SEE how many people have done 
so.  
God Bless!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves!!  
Lord I love you and I need you, come into my heart, please. 
Pass  this message to 8 people except you and me. 
You will receive a miracle  tomorrow. 
Don't ignore and God will bless you. 
Know that you are already  blessed by the person whom sent this 
to you.
