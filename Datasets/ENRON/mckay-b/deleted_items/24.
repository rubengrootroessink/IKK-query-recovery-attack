After talking with Marc Deer today, it is apparent that a large number
of owners have not paid their final cash call to Port O'Connor Country
Club, L.P.  THIS AMOUNT IS DUE IN FULL IMMEDIATELY!  If you have
received any separate invoices from M.L. Deer, these also need to be
paid immediately.  Checks need to be sent to Becky at Tri-C, 909 Wirt
Rd, 77024.  Marc is holding checks to subcontractors who are screaming
to be paid and those of you who have not yet paid (for whatever reason)
are clogging up the works.  Please focus on this issue ASAP before this
becomes a bigger problem than it already is.

If you have any outstanding issues with M.L. Deer Construction, such as
punchlist items, your separate flooring invoices, etc. call Marc or
Andrew Pena today and get it resolved.  They are waiting to hear from
you.  Deer's office number is 713-681-1100.

Do not call or e-mail me with any complaints on this.  I have sunk way
too many hours into this today.  I am ready to close anyone's unit who
has (a) paid the final cash call and (b) paid their Condo assessment.
So far I have only heard from two people who are ready to close.  Also,
two of you have not paid their Condo assessment..  Please do me the
favor of handling this in a professional, responsive manner.

Also, please do not plan to air your complaints at next Tuesday's board
meeting.  You should address all your issues with M.L. Deer Construction
prior to the meeting.  We will have a full agenda and many other
important things to discuss.

Thanks in advance for your earliest attention to this matter.

John Wallace
