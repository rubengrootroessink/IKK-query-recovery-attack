QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
"I'm thankful I'm alive, but I feel guilty I'm alive. I'm
trying to remember the guys who aren't here. Their wives
and children. It's a   hollow feeling. You try to laugh
sometimes to keep   your sanity, but you feel bad   about
laughing."
-ROBERT MADDALONE, Firefighter, Squad 1
