* Holiday Rental Cars - Book Early and Save Big! 
Dear priceline customer, 
It's never too early to get a great deal on a rental car , but 
sometimes it can be too late -- especially around the holidays. 
That's when some locations sell out entirely and the last minute 
rush to rent can drive the price of a rental car up by as 
much as 20% or more! 
So if you know you'll need a rental car  over the upcoming Thanksgiving  or Christmas  holidays strike now while the iron 
and the deals are hot. If you wait too long, all the cars 
and good deals will be gone! 
Thinking ahead certainly paid off for these priceline customers:
