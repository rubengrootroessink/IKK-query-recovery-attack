The Wall Street Alert - Special Investment Report - LQDX
   Smart investors understand that companies with
government and military applications are especially
attractive in times of global instability.
   Our current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of Arizona
(OTC BB: LQDX), has positioned itself as the leading
competitor in the high-tech industrial manufacturing
industry with its customizable array of magnetic fluid
vacuum seals.
   NASA, Honeywell, ADM, Intel, have already used the
vacuum seals created by Liquidix. These products benefit
such important technologies as navigational gyros,
infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sighting
and night-vision equipment.
   Liquidix has signed contracts with several
Military/Government Agencies and U.S. National
Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced
significant growth in the company.
   Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world to
produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the only one
that is traded publicly in the United States. Because
costs in this industry are very similar between companies,
Liquidix has studied and surpassed its competition in
delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same product to
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor,
making them especially desirable for companies who must
meet an increasing demand for magnetic fluid vacuum seals.
Liquidix has conservatively estimated that their gross
revenues for 2002 will increase more than 40% over 2001,
and by 2003 will increase another 110%. Through strategic
mergers and acquisitions Liquidix also estimates that
their profit margins for 2002 will increase by 60% over
2001, and by 2003 will increase another 200%.

REASONS TO OWN THE STOCK
  1. Liquidix provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for
government and military applications that are in higher
demand due to increasing military activity in the U.S.
  2. Liquidix, through strategic alliances and
acquisitions, has established itself as the leader of an
industry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion
dollars by 2002.
  3. Liquidix provides products to industry giants such as
NASA, HONEYWELL, INTEL, and ADM, virtually guaranteeing
the growth of this strong company.
  4. Liquidix aggressive and strategic acquisition of
companies like Advanced Fluid Systems demonstrates a
strong vision for the future and positions them as a world
leader in magnetic fluid technology.
  5. Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world
to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it is the only
one that is traded publicly in the U.S.
  6. Facilities owned and operated by Liquidix in the
United States and Europe have given the company a foothold
on both sides of the Atlantic, with opportunities to break
into additional international markets.
