?For all the scientists out there and for all the students who have a hard
time convincing these people regarding the truth of the Bible...here's
?something that
?shows God's awesome creation and shows that He is still in control. Did
you
? know that the space program is busy proving that what has been called
"myth" in the Bible is true?

?Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore
Maryland and a consultant in the space Program relates the following
development.
?"I? think one of the most amazing things that God has for us today
happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Greenbelt,
Maryland.
They were checking the position of the sun, moon, and planets out in space
where they would be 100 years and 1000 years from now.? We have to know this
so we won't send a satellite, up and have it bump into something later on in
its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the
satellite, and where
the planets will be so the whole thing will not bog down.

They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries and it
?came to a halt. The computer stopped and put up a red signal, which meant
?that there was something wrong either with the information fed into it or
with the results as compared to the standards.

?They called in the service department to check it out and they said,"What's
wrong?" Well, they found there is a day missing in space in elapsed time.
They
?scratched their heads and tore their hair. There was no answer.

?Finally, a Christian man on the team said, "You know, one time I was in
?Sunday School and they talked about the sun standing still."
?While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an answer either, so they
?said, "Show us." He got a Bible and went back to the book of Joshua where
?they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with "common sense."
?There they found the Lord saying to Joshua, "Fear them not, I have
delivered
them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee."
?Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy and if
darkness fell they would overpower them. So Joshua asked the Lord to make
the
sun
?stand still! That's right-"The sun stood still and the moon stayed and
hasted not to go down about a whole day!"?? (Joshua 10:12-13)

The astronauts and scientists said, "There is the missing day!"? They
checked
the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close
but not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day
was
23 hours and 20 minutes-not a whole day.

?They read the Bible and there it was "about (approximately) a day." These
?little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble
because if you cannot account for 40 minutes you'll still be in trouble
1,000
years from now.
Forty? minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over
in orbits.

?As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the
?Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS. The scientists told him he was
?out of his mind, but they got out the Book and read these words in 2 Kings
?that told of the following story: Hezekiah, on his deathbed, was visited
by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die. Hezekiah
asked for a sign as proof.

?Isaiah said "Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?"

Hezekiah said "It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let
the shadow return backward 10 degrees."

Isaiah spoke to the Lord and the Lord brought the shadow ten
degreesBACKWARD!

Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes! Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in
?Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the
universe!

?Isn't it amazing?

?References: Joshua 10:8 and 12, 13 and 2 Kings 20:9-11.

?Forward this to as many people who you believe would think this is equally
as cool.

?Never be afraid to try something new.? Remember, amateurs built the ark.
?Professionals built the Titanic.

?

?Have a great day!
