ws  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gar=
y on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster.=
 This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursda=
y. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 11=
/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half =
of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not thro=
w a touchdown pass for the f! ir! st time this season, however, and has bee=
n very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to =
struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.=
  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who wi=
ll start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batch i=
s still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. Mike=
 McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, but=
 the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears seconda=
ry. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  ! Quincy Carter , QB =
DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter =
will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's game=
 against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dallas=
, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't rec=
ommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Up=
dated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pu=
lled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an =
eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a final decis=
ion on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Sanders i=
s expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring problem that l=
imited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against San Diego. Chec=
k back on his status before making a final decision on him for Week 12.  Je=
ff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Graham suffered a bruised t=
high in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day to day.  Jason =
Brookins  , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/26/01 Brookins may miss the rest of t=
he season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate Moe Williams into the =
starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlo=
w , RB SF - G money Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Su=
nday. His status for next week has not been determined yet.  James Jackson =
, RB CLE - God Updated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on S=
unday. His current status is day to! d! ay.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free =
Agent Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game =
against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in =
the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna ,=
 QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for =
the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was re=
placed by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smit=
h late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy lea=
gues right now.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/25/01 Mc=
Cardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly =
raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy=
 player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  St=
acey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and =
two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his=
 good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Q=
adry Ismail , WR BAL - God Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to thre=
e catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail r=
emains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most comp=
lete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos =
Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, =
but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a =
Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes U=
pdated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakla=
nd. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season=
.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 ya=
rds and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has p=
layed well recently, although his o! wn! ers would still like to see him sc=
ore on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Update=
d 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day ag=
ainst Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, inc=
luding 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - St=
arboy Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and =
two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the =
matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touc=
hdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reser=
ve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 11=
/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yar=
ds and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy=
 receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie=
 Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing ag=
ainst New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He m=
ay not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in=
 deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had =
another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England=
. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth startin=
g on a weekly basis.  ! Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01=
 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for=
 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and=
 Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the n=
ear future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many =
carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated=
 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against N=
ew Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly optio=
n for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - God Updated 11/25/01 Brady p=
ut up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four =
touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performan=
ce will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  =
Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, =
three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked c=
onditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Footb=
all.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sun=
day's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He wa=
s replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds =
, WR BUF - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extend=
ed slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He a=
lso lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has=
 been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follo=
ws his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  =
