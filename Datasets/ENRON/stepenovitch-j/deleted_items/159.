Have you ever been to Austin?  It's wonderful.  Think about it.  50,000 students, half of them co-eds. . .

I'm looking out for you.

The question back to you is, "Do you want to go with us?"

Thanks for the update. Did he bring any friends home?  I was a good girl last night. I'll probably go for awhile tonight. We'll see. Are you going to austin with us this weekend?
