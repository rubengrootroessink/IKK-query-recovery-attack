( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Expansion Brewing at Coors, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 29, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). The country's third largest beer brewer, Adolph Coors
Company (NYSE:RKY) (Golden, Colo.), is underway with a $68 million
program to increase brewing capacity through an expansion at their
Memphis, Tennessee brewery. The program began over a year ago with the
goal of increasing brewing capacity by a million barrels per year.
	   The challenge is to increase capacity without having to shut down
and lose the current 3.8 million barrel per year production volume.
Utilizing in-house engineering talent and support from alliance
engineering firm Jacobs Engineering Group (Pasadena, Calif.), Coors
has developed a plan to achieve this through strategic replacement of
old equipment and automation integration. The project also involves
implementation of a new technology, which removes oxygen that can be
harmful to malt during the brewing process.
	   With all of these systems in place along with brewing and
packaging debottlenecks, Coors hopes to achieve its goal of increasing
capacity by February of 2003. Peter H. Coors, chairman of Coors
Brewing Company, added, "The beer industry has had a flat year;
however, the company has high expectations from the Memphis brewery
and its ability to increase volume."
	   Coors reported net sales of $1.87 billion for the first three
quarters of this year and have released third quarter net income
increase of thirteen percent compared with the same period last year.
Coors brews about 23 million barrels per year between its Golden,
Colorado and Memphis, Tennessee breweries, making it the third largest
domestic brewer.
