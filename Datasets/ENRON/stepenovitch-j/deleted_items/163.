    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.; Houston).
Constellation Energy Group (NYSE:CEG) (Baltimore) is currently
underway on construction of a $250 million 680 mega-watt (MW) natural
gas-fired power plant in central Florida.
	   The Oleander Power Plant, located on a 37-acre site in Brevard
County near the City of Cocoa off I-95 and State Road 520, is
scheduled to be in commercial operation by May of 2002. It will
provide enough power to serve the electric needs of nearly 250,000
homes.
	   Lockwood Greene (Spartanburg, S.C.) has been selected to provide
engineering services and the construction division, J. A. Jones
Construction (Charlotte, N.C.), will construct the plant. Both
companies are part of Jones Incorporated.
	   The simple-cycle plant will consist of five units utilizing
General Electric 7FA combustion turbines. A seven-year power sales
agreement has also been reached with Seminole Electric Cooperative
(Tampa, Fla.) to purchase a portion of the plant's electrical output.
The remainder of the power will be sold on the wholesale power market
to help meet the growing energy demand in Florida.
	   Constellation Energy Group is an integrated energy company, which
includes Constellation Power Source, Baltimore Gas and Electric, the
oldest utility in the country, and Constellation Nuclear. Formed in
1997, Constellation Power Source is a national merchant energy company
that meets the energy requirements of wholesale customers such as
electric co-operatives, power marketers, municipalities, and
utilities.
