layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 Fr=
anks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was g=
ood for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games thi=
s year and has become a major scoring! t! hreat even though he is not very =
effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Upd=
ated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving =
and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, ho=
wever, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench =
him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 y=
ards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsis=
tent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week=
.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for=
 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, bu=
t he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may c=
ontinue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or c=
ontinues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 Bost=
on had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yar=
ds and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league an=
d is worth starting on a weekly basis.   M! ic! hael Pittman , RB ARI - BCW=
D's Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas Ci=
ty, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post =
numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to =
have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gr=
aham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 ya=
rds and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start =
on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tom=
linson , RB SD - G money Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for =
the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed =
for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players=
 in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/21/01 Clar=
k had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score ag=
ainst San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy =
perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , Q=
B DEN - G money Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started S! un! day's gam=
e against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a=
 touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , =
WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yar=
ds against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his ow=
ners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN =
- Kar Bombs Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 c=
arries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performa=
nce very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ter=
rell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robin=
son injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago pas=
sing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushe=
d for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself a=
s Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest =
of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck cau=
ght seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detr! oi! t. Despite some quiet =
outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with=
 the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - =
Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was in=
tercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in=
 two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his histor=
y of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 10/21/01 Mc=
Nair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He com=
pleted only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, poss=
ibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie Geo=
rge , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 ca=
rries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has cert=
ainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free =
Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD =
against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency,=
 so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL =
- G money Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a T=
D against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for=
 the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 10=
/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is d=
efinitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , W=
R NO - Oper Error Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving =
yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low=
-qua! li! ty Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing o=
wners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. War=
d is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy ap=
peal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in =
the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played=
 despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was li=
mited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony =
Becht  , TE NYJ - R-Diddy Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St=
. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been incons=
istent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes h=
im worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson=
 , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards ag=
ainst Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Bra=
d Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers=
 on a regular basis.  Jerome Betti!  , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Be=
ttis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also=
 threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good nu=
mbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated=
 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 y=
ards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back m=
ay be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall F=
aulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a hu=
ge game on Sun! da! y, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score agains=
t Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 recei=
ving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspe=
