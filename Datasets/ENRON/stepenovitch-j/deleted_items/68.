layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - God Updated 10/23/01 According to the =
Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters wi=
ll return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be an=
other month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgr=
en said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineu=
p. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in a=
nd played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play ag=
ain." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both ba=
cks on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from A=
lexander down the stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
3/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has =
lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantas=
y rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/=
23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's ga=
me against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces =
Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled=
 groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck f! ro! m a Fanta=
sy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Free =
Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for nex=
t Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine th=
e extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric War=
d , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due =
to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn'=
t a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MI=
A - God Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle inju=
ry. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to u=
se him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs =
Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris =
Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use =
either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi=
ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pa=
thon , WR IND - Kar Bombs U! pdated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third st=
raight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use=
 him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wi=
lkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs=
. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Da=
vis , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's gam=
e against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, =
but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him! . ! He wil=
l work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whet=
her Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league un=
less it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100=
 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/23/01 A=
ccording to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain,=
 as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, ho=
wever, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Stale=
y , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game again=
st the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just t=
hree times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll=
 Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11! c! arries late in the game. At this=
 point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, =
so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   =
Joe Nedney , K TEN - Oper Error Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck inj=
ury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE=
 TEN - G money Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report =
because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's ga=
me.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recoveri=
ng from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the=
 Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TE=
N - BCWD's Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game=
. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Bee=
gs Boys Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result =
of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's =
game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessea=
n reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver=
 is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of re=
st, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Ro=
okie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starbo=
y Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An =
MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fre=
d Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of S=
unday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains =
uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exerci=
ses and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Time=
s-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is=
 slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of=
 legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inactiv=
e since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR C=
LE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a =
concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next we=
ek.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Kar Bombs Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sun=
day but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic th=
at the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the=
 last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beeg=
s Boys Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's ga=
me with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brook=
ins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL=
 - Beegs Boy! s ! Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be =
ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so=
 sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac s=
aid Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven'=
t picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." R=
andall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir =
Hakim , WR STL - God Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during S=
unday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be a=
vailable for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB=
 STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispa=
tch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend =
against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," c=
oach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinc=
ed that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." =
Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jet=
s, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J=
.J. Stokes , WR SF - El-Gato Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye =
week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy.=
 "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I=
 was ! ab! le to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Tim=
es . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn c=
lose." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a r=
egular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard=
 , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each =
week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Me=
n with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and l=
ooked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  =
 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night=
's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserv=
e wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/=
01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's g=
ame against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a we=
ek ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for thi=
s game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got =
to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence =
is he's unable to go.    More Updates  Rosters Teams  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMA=
