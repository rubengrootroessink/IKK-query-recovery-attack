( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) LS Power Shifts Focus Towards
Development of New Coal-Fired Plants, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). LS Power Development LLC (East Brunswick,
N.J.), a fast growing Private Energy Producer (PEP) and developer, has
shifted its focus towards the development of new coal-fired power
plants. Once a very active player in the race to construct new natural
gas-fired generating plants, LS Power announced in late 2000 plans to
divest some 5,633 megawatts (MW) of natural gas-fired operating plants
and projects in construction and advanced development. The sale to NRG
Energy Incorporated (Minneapolis) (NYSE:NRG) was finalized in early
2001 and included ten natural gas-fired projects located in Illinois,
Mississippi, Florida and Texas.
	   LS Power has not ruled out further development of new natural
gas-fired power plants, but in recent months has announced aggressive
plans for development of new coal-fired generating stations. Research
conducted by IndustrialInfo.com has identified six coal-fired projects
in the early stages of development being proposed by LS Power. If
built, these projects would be located in at least five different
states and represent over 6,000MW coming into operation by 2007.
Announcements for an additional six coal-fired projects could be
forthcoming by LS Power over the next several months.
	   LS Power Development LLC is a privately held Private Energy
Producer that develops, finances, owns and manages independent power
projects in the United States with headquarters in East Brunswick,
N.J., and a major development office in Saint Louis.
