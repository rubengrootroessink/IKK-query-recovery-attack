 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos U=
pdated 11/18/01 Cleeland (ankle) has been declared inactive for Sunday's ga=
me against Indianapolis. Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time at ti=
ght end in his absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
White (ankle) will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much against th=
e Tampa Bay defense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/18/01 Jackso=
n (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against the R=
avens.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 McNair will st=
art Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking pre-game snaps wi=
thout any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb injury, isn't worth=
 starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.   Jacquez Green ,=
 WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 Green (abdominal strain) is out for Su=
nday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence.  James Stewart , RB =
DET - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game again=
st Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making p=
rogress, and is getting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , =
TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) has been plac=
ed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. The =
big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy! p! layer.   Mark Brunell , QB=
 JAC - G money Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday a=
gainst Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than=
 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him =
in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin=
) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearanc=
e before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is abl=
e to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will =
get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a=
 wise move.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (f=
oot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indiana=
polis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James J=
ackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gam=
etime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable=
 to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay g=
etting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI -=
 El-Gato Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's =
game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the =
game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewi=
s , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Le=
wis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went int=
o effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate w=
ith the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work tow=
ard recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - E=
l-Gato Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the C=
hargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Cro=
ckett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gat=
o Updated 11/16/01According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to pl=
ay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start f=
rom a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/1=
6/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinn=
ati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dril=
ls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite no=
t being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmi=
tt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/16/01!  Smith will return to the =
lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained =
right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that=
 Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps =
Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back ag=
ainst the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on =
Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.=
  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league =
this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth=
 considering as long as ! he! 's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - P=
errito-style Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will b=
e the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However=
, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN=
 - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season d=
espite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one=
 of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and s=
hould be in your starting lineup on a weekly b! as! is.   Cris Carter , WR =
MIN - Starboy Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this s=
eason, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a=
 knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie=
 CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR=
 MIN - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game =
against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving th=
is season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential t=
o post solid F! an! tasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Update=
d 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and i=
s a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defens=
e that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start=
.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game=
 against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores.=
 He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge n=
umbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indiana=
polis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/16/01 Jack=
son put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catch=
es and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad th=
at is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a=
 solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error U! pdated 11/16/01 Dav=
is has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged=
 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as =
a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver d=
efense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touc=
hdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend agains=
t a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth con=
sidering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Ga=
to Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has=
 caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver =
secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deepe=
r leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching on=
ly three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend=
 against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Haki=
m , WR STL - God Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent wee=
ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is =
right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so av=
oid using him outside of deeper leagues.   More Updates  Schedule, Breakdow=
