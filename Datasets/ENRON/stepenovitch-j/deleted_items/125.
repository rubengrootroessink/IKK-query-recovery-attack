atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Green=
 should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Ch=
iefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , =
TE IND - God Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapo=
lis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated=
 New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. H=
e will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England t=
his week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Beegs Boys Updated 10/18/01 James was =
held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this ye=
ar. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne=
 , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in plac!=
 e ! of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne ha=
s not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harr=
ison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs we=
ll in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. E=
xpect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB=
 IND - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time=
 he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but =
should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN =
- G money Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday d=
ue to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and p=
lay Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him u=
ntil it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - =
Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle =
injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his p=
rogress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE =
- Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week.=
 Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately=
 proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith ,=
 RB NE - Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the=
 first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone=
 at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne C=
hrebet , WR NYJ - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been ve=
ry disappointing so far. He could have a good week! i! f the Jets engage in=
 a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will=
 center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Pe=
rrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the =
Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs shou=
ld be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Kar Bomb=
s Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense t=
his week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the R=
ams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his f=
irst decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a v=
ery risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carol=
ina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warran=
ts consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks=
 was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 pass=
es for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even wo=
rth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS -=
 El-Gato Update! d ! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this se=
ason, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some suc=
cess against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting i=
n deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - BCWD's Updated 10/18/01 Tes=
taverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be o=
pportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first intercep=
tion of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasb=
y will likely get most of the work at tight end no! w ! that Stephen Alexan=
der is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this poin=
t.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have =
a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's wor=
th considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Tor=
ry Holt , WR STL - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to po=
st big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big ti=
me Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.=
   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very c=
onsistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Lo=
ok for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets seconda=
ry.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Tacos Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a =
decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring=
 on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your rost=
er.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wi!=
 ll! likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend=
 against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is=
 easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner =
, QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts=
 up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post =
another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him=
 your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Buck=
halter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the major=
ity of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will=
 start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more=
 productiv! e ! of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style=
 Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, a=
nd is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two s=
cores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your=
 lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is =
slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's =
worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this=
 point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-C=
osta Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligamen=
t in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to fo=
ur weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaw=
are of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Hurricanes Updated=
 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbe=
rs on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight en=
ds and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   More Updates =
