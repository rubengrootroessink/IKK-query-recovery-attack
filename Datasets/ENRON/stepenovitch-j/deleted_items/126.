( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sands Running for South
African/Australian Mining Venture, in an Advisory by

    Business/Energy Editors & Environmental Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). The joint venture Ticor SA, between Kumba
Resources, the mining arm of Iscor the South Africa steel company, and
Australia's Ticor, has brought in the biggest Australian investment to
South Africa to date. Kumba has sold 40% of their heavy minerals sand
mining project near Richard Bay off the Kwazulu-Natal Indian Ocean
coast. Kumba banked approximately $40 million on the signing of the
deal and Ticor has the option to increase its stake to 80% when the
$130 million smelter is completed during the second phase of the
project at the end of 2003.
	   With this venture, Ticor could double the company's profit, as
titanium dioxide slag production would double to 100,000 tons per
annum. This would mean that Ticor could control 11% of global titanium
feedstock, making it the third largest producer in the world. The new
project would also make South Africa the world leader in titanium
oxide production. The 80 million tons of heavy mineral reserves at the
Hillendale mine will represent the first phase and will be undertaken
with hydraulic mining methods. Reserves are expected to last about ten
years but the operation could be extended to 22 years by starting new
mines at Fairbreeze to the south before the Hillendale deposit runs
out. The project is expected to attract $110 million of foreign
investment in the next two years and has established a community
development program in the area. Environmental protection and safety
have also received priority attention as have other sand mining
projects in the area.
