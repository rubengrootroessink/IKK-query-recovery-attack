	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) (Columbus, Ohio) and
development partner The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:DOW) (Midland, MI)
are expecting final permit approval in November for the construction
of a 900 mega-watt (MW) $325 million cogeneration unit to be
constructed at Dow's Plaquemine chemical complex in Louisiana.
	   AEP plans to begin construction during December of 2001 utilizing
their subsidiary AEP Pro Serv, Incorporated (Columbus, OH) for
engineering design on the project that is scheduled to take 22 months
to complete. A short list of two general contractors has also been

is also in place with Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc. a subsidiary of
Belgian company Tractebel S.A.

facility will bring generating capacity to Louisiana using
environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient technology, while at the
same time allowing Dow to achieve greater energy efficiency in its
core business."
