	   HOUSTON--October 25, 2001--Researched by Industrialinfo.com
(Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston, Texas). Human Genome
Sciences, Inc. (Rockville, Md.) (NASDAQ:HGSI) has begun yet another
multimillion dollar project as part of an ambitious expansion program
in Rockville, Maryland. The new $100 million facility will be capable
of manufacturing commercial quantities of multiple drugs. Among other
products, HGSI expects to manufacture novel human hormones, used in
the treatment of various conditions ranging from skin ulcers to immune
system stimulation therapies and human antibody drugs for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Gilbane Building Company
(Providence, Rhode Island) is the construction manager for the 360,000
square foot project, expected to be complete in 2003.
	   The 27-acre manufacturing campus currently houses a 127,000 square
foot manufacturing and process development facility to supply human
protein and antibodies for human clinical testing needs, while a
52,000 square foot quality assurance and quality control facility
provides production support.
	   In June of this year, HGSI broke ground on a $250 million research
& development and corporate campus at their 55 acre site located
approximately a mile away. This 418,871 square foot project is the
first phase of what will eventually be 1,030,000 square feet of R&D
laboratories and office space.
	   Human Genome Sciences, Inc., founded in 1992, is a pioneer in the
use of genomics, the study of all human genes, and the development of
new pharmaceutical products. They currently have five drugs in human
clinical trials and plan to be a global pharmaceutical company that
discovers, develops, manufactures and sells their own genomics-based
drugs.
