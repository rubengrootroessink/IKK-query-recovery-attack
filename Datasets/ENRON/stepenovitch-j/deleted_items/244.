t NFL Player News  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 10/31/01 Bettis=
 has a sore knee but is listed as probable on the injury report for Sunday'=
s game against Baltimore, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He shou=
ld be fine, although he's going up against a stingy Ravens rush defense thi=
s week.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Ward has been d=
owngraded from questionable to out for Sunday's game against Carolina due t=
o a foot injury. He's no longer worth wa! st! ing a roster spot on.  Jacque=
z Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Green is listed as questionab=
le for Sunday's game at Green Bay due to a hip pointer. He could be ready b=
y the end of the week, but you might as well keep him reserved this week.  =
Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/31/01 Johnson did not practice =
Monday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Green Bay due to =
a bone bruise on his right knee. Don't use him this week unless it becomes =
clear he will play.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/31/01 =
Dunn is expected to return to the lineup Sunday at Green Bay. He would serv=
e as the starting tailback, with Mike Alstott moving back to fullback.  Mik=
e Alstott , RB TB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/31/01 According to the St. Petersb=
urg Times, Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy plans to return Alstott to his fullba=
ck position if Warrick Dunn returns to the lineup as expected Sunday at Gre=
en Bay. "To me it's not so much what we do or who we're going to get the ba=
ll to," Dungy said. "Aaron Stecker averaged about 6 ya! rd! s a carry yeste=
rday. That's not to say Mike didn't do a good job, but we can't look at it =
and say, "Just because Mike Alstott was the ballcarrier, that's why we got =
things going.' " We expect Tampa Bay to give Alstott increased carries at D=
unn's expense if both play, in which case neither will be a great starter i=
n Week Eight.  Rian Lindell , K SEA - Kar Bombs Updated 10/31/01 According =
to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , the Seahawks worked out three free-agen=
t kickers on Tuesday as they consider switching from Lindell. Shayne Graham=
, Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso were brought in for tryouts, although Head Co=
ach Mike Holmgren is likely to give Lindell one more chance to redeem himse=
lf. Keep an eye on this situation - Lindell is a pretty risky kicker to own=
 right now.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Zereoue is=
 listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Baltimore due to a should=
er injury. If he can't go, Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala would assume the third-do=
wn back role and the backup job to Jerome Bettis. Based on Bettis' great pl=
ay this season, don't expect either Zereoue or Fuamatu-Ma'afala to help you=
r team unless Bettis gets hurt. ! Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/31/01 Chrebet, who has been suffering from headaches stemming from a =
concussion he suffered on Oct. 14, should resume practicing on Wednesday. H=
e should be able to play on Sunday, but hold off starting him until an offi=
cial decision is made.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 10/31/0=
1 Alexander is considered probable for Sunday's game at San Diego despite i=
njured ribs. If by some chance he can't play, Larry Parker would likely get=
 the start.  Mike Green , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Green and Sk=
ip Hicks are expected to split carries for the Titans if Eddie George is un=
able to play Sunday against Jacksonville. This isn't a good scenario for so=
lid Fantasy stats, and we don't recommend you use either this week. However=
, you might want to pick up Green and/or Hicks in a deeper league in case G=
eorge's injury is deemed long-term.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated=
 10/31/01 According to the Nashville Tennessean, George suffered multiple i=
njuries during Monday's game against Pittsbu! rg! h and could miss Sunday's=
 game against Jacksonville as a result. "It is unlikely Eddie [will practic=
e] much this week, we'll just have to wait and see," said Titans Head Coach=
 Jeff Fisher. George is battling a hyperextended left knee, left quad (thig=
h) contusion and a sprained right ankle. He's a real risk to use this week =
unless it's definite that he will be able to play.  Quincy Carter , QB DAL =
- Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Carter is likely to return from hamstring sur=
gery in about four weeks. While he could get some playing time at QB for th=
e Cowboys, he's not worth picking up this season.  Clint Stoerne!   , QB DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo is leaning to=
wards starting Stoerner against the Giants on Sunday, according to the Fort=
 Worth Star-Telegram. However, backup Ryan Leaf could see some time dependi=
ng on the outcome of the game. We still don't recommend either player for F=
antasy purposes.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/31/01 Accor=
ding to The Dallas Morning News, Smith's sprained right knee probably will =
not prevent him from playing Sunday against the Giants. However, he won't p=
ractice Wednesday and will likely be limited for the rest of the week. "If =
he's ready at 1 p.m. Sunday, New York time, then he'll start at running bac=
k," s! ai! d Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo. "It's just a day-to-day situati=
on, and it's relatively mild." If Smith can't go, Troy Hambrick would start=
 at halfback with J.J. Huggins at fullback. We expect Smith to be fine and =
start this week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Miller =
expects to be ready for his fifth straight start Sunday against Cleveland d=
espite a left hip pointer, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . "I feel pre=
tty good," he said. "I'm going to practice [today], and we'll see how it fe=
els. [Today] will be the deciding factor. Guys on this team are working rea=
lly hard, and I don't want to be the one to let them down. I want to contin=
ue to play and keep on winning." Miller will probably start, but Shane Matt=
hews will be ready to go if not. We don't recommend you use Miller unless h=
e is officially slated to start.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated=
 10/31/01 Allen will run Tuesday for the first time after being limited to =
treading water in the pool at the team training facility due to a sprained =
ankle. Jason Brookins would get the start if Allen can't go, and that's pro=
bably the better situation for Fantasy owners in the first place. Only use =
Broo! k! ins of the two, if you dare use him against Pittsburgh.  Elvis Grb=
ac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Grbac is likely to be listed as q=
uestionable for Sunday's game at Pittsburgh due to strained rib cartilage. =
He has been progressing in his recovery, which suggests only some fibers we=
re torn, but all indications are that he will not play. Randall Cunningham =
would get the start if Grbac can't go, and at this point we can't recommend=
 you use any Baltimore QB.  Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/31/0=
1 Moore underwent another MRI on his injured hamstring on Monday, and is wa=
iting for the results. We don't expect him to help anyone's Fantasy squad t=
he remainder of the season.  Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/3=
1/01 Hardy could miss two-to-three weeks due to a rotator cuff injury, acco=
rding to The Arizona Republic. "Terry may be out for a while," said Cardina=
ls Head Coach Dave McGinnis. "They're going to immobilize it (the shoulder)=
 in a sling, and he, for sure, will not be there this week. However much lo=
nger it will be is to be determined, but I think it's probably a multiple-w=
eek thing." Don't bother holding on to Hardy.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - B=
CWD's Updated 10/31/01 Pittman is still recovering from his second concussi=
on in the past three weeks. The Cardinals are likely to go with Thomas Jone=
s and Marcel Shipp for Sunday's game against Philadelphia as a result. We d=
on't recommend any of the three against the tough Eagles rush defense.  Emm=
itt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/30/01 Smith is day to day after =
receiving results of his MRI, according to published reports. He will not p=
ractice Tuesday or Wednesday but could return on Thursday. Smith looks like=
 a go for Week Eight.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito-style Updated 1=
0/30/01 Alexander is likely to miss his third straight game Sunday against =
Seattle due to a high ankle sprain. The Redskins are targeting their Novemb=
er 18 game at Dallas for his return.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Update=
d 10/30/01 George left Monday's game in the third quarter after injuring hi=
s knee. He is scheduled for an MRI on Tuesday. "It's not the ACL or the MCL=
, it's behind the knee," head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesse=
an. "We'll have to take a look at it and we'll know mor! e ! about the situ=
ation in the next couple of days."    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Up=
dated 10/30/01 Wheatley's injured wrist and knee have improved but his stat=
us for Sunday's game is uncertain. He is listed as questionable.  Dedric Wa=
rd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Ward is not expected to play Sund=
ay against the Panthers. He is listed as questionable.   Chris Chambers  , =
WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Chambers suffered a bruised rib in Sun=
day's game but is expected to play this week. He is also expected to practi=
ce.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Parker could be th=
e Chief new starting receiver, replacing incumbent Derrick Alexander. "I mi=
ght [start Parker]," head coach Dick Vermeil told The Kansas City Star."I d=
on't know. I'll talk to the coaches." Consider adding Parker to your roster=
. He had two TD receptions in the Chiefs last game.   Derrick Alexander , W=
R KC - G ! mo! ney Updated 10/30/01 Alexander is still suffering from torn =
cartilage in his ribs and might not play Sunday. "If I feel like this going=
 into the weekend, I won't be able to play," Alexander told The Kansas City=
 Star. Alexander still might not start when he regains his health. The Chie=
fs are considering starting rookie Larry Parker over Alexander.     Marshal=
l Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy Updated 10/30/01 Faulk is expected to return to =
the Rams' starting lineup on November 11 against Carolina.  More Updates   =
Player News Teams  [IMAGE]God Player News  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated =
10/30/01 Garcia suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament during Sunda=
y's game at Chicago. He might need to wear a protective brace for next Sund=
ay's game against Detroit, but is expected to play. Don't be afraid to use =
Garcia against the Lions' poor secondary.  Rob Johnson , Reserve QB Updated=
 10/29/01 Johnson injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The=
 injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and s=
houlder.  Troy Brown , Reserve WR Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes=
 for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 =
yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive =
teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 10/28=
/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the =
strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable=
, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yard=
age numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall outpu=
t.  Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 10/26/01 Smith has a leg injury but is =
expected to play this week. He is listed as probable on the injury report. =
Expect Smith to overcome his injury and be a solid Fantasy back this week. =
  Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 10/26/01 Owens set the record for most =
receptions in a game the last time he played the Bears. He won't be as effe=
ctive this week, but will be a productive receiver.   Wesley Walls , Active=
 TE Updated 10/26/01 Walls will get a lot of important looks this week. The=
 Panthers should move the ball rather well against the Jets, and Walls may =
be open for TD catches near the goal line.  Qadry Ismail , Active WR Update=
d 10/26/01 Ismail has developed into a good all-around receiver. He is defi=
nitely worth a start against the inconsistent Jaguars secondary.  Tim Biaka=
butuka , Reserve RB Updated 10/25/01 Biakabutuka will be out until at least=
 training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foo=
t. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football=
 related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basicall=
y, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. =
"The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back togeth=
er." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, =
visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was f=
ar worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. =
  Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News =
Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to=
 the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month =
or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I =
would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was ou=
r best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played we=
ll. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you=
 have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your =
team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander dow=
n the stretch.  Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered=
 a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However,=
 he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans=
.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 10/21/01 Jackson had a surprisingly =
productive game against Baltimore, rushing for 77 yards and a score. The ro=
okie seems to be all the way back from a nagging rib injury, and is slowly =
becoming a good Fantasy player.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 =
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don'=
t expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week=
.  Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in =
practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.  Bills , =
Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game ag=
ainst Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He wal=
ked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return i=
s questionable.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 08/08/01 Linebacker Derric=
k Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a=
 contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesda=
y.   John Carney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker=
 for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisc=
o 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49e=
rs have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Charg=
ers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney =
is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.   [IMAGE]  Copyrigh=
