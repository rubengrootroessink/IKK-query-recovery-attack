, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Rod Smith , WR DEN - G mon=
ey Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to=
 practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's g=
ame against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it durin=
g Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your be=
nch for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense=
 as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prio=
r to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Upda! te! d 11/20/01 With =
Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will r=
emain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge =
to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs thi=
s week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - God Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick w=
ith Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don=
't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid =
Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance p=
olicy if you can.  Jo! na! than Quinn  , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this=
 week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters =
, RB SEA - God Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently heal=
ed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected t=
o return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will conti=
nue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes in=
to view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy ! Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told =
the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and=
 rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You ca=
n talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this buildi=
ng. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the n=
ext week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantas=
y owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will=
 miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may=
 adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely rega=
rded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is n=
o longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Er=
ron Kinney , TE TEN - G money Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this =
week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early=
 this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (cal=
f) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 1=
1.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says=
 McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on =
Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice tim=
e this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 11/20/01 Alexand=
er (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle=
.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is liste=
d as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his plac=
e,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a spraine=
d knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Ter=
rence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/! 20! /01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will =
be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Ter=
rence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay F=
iedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami =
Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right =
now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my=
 only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free =
football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money  Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan s=
aid he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play i=
n Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that=
 during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help o=
ur football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform=
 at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and =
put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay w=
ill play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of the =
games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver=
, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receive=
r has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WA=
S - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sund=
ay's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weeke=
nd vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and shou=
ld be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Upd=
ated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesda=
y at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used wh=
en the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - God Updated 11/20/01=
 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session =
of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered ser=
ious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday=
 Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin=
 suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll mis=
s a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game ag=
ainst Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a=
 key blocker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Starboy Updated 11/20/01=
 According to the New York Post , cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repa=
ired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact,=
 the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris C=
arter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a b=
ad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the re=
st of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 The =
Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as th=
e team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for =
most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver,! WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Dri=
ver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday'=
s game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy =
player at this point.   Ravens , DT BAL - BCWD's Updated 11/20/01 Defensive=
 end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee=
 surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore de=
fense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    =
Cowboys , DT DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, w=
ho was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get t=
he start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Den=
ver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' =
defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricane=
s Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denve=
r. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told t=
he Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to=
 Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.   =
  Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruise=
d ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practic=
e time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. T=
he Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn=
 into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAG=
