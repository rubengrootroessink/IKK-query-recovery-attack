, Player Updates  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , W=
R SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may =
bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should =
be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Ga=
to Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an advers=
e impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you stil=
l need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle=
 against a de! ce! nt Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give y=
ou serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. Th=
e Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart ,=
 QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has =
improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit us=
ing on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which=
 is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in y=
our league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson=
 should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their pas=
sing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackso=
n will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos U=
pdated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate=
 Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get=
 Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrit=
o-style Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against t=
he Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New Yo=
rk is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternati=
ve on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten =
and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inco=
nsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten=
 could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider usin=
g him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/=
01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and =
has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expe=
ct another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antow=
ain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surp=
rise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saint=
s rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lin=
eup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsde=
n has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use hi=
m this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider pu=
tting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James =
McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility Mc=
Knight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. Howe=
ver, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - =
Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday=
 against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a d=
eep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony=
 Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good =
Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of=
 a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis ,=
 RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Den=
ver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle=
 against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start h=
im considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Pa=
rker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pas=
s Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been bur=
ned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver f=
or this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richar=
dson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a c=
hance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should =
move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touc=
hdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes=
 , RB KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01The Chiefs will use many plays to keep t=
he Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some ve=
ry good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup d=
espite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - =
Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their by=
e week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decen=
t stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him ov=
er a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito!=
 -s! tyle Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will=
 be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been=
 inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewh=
at of a gamble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn=
't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you us=
e him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he w=
ill break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Ga=
rdner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some tro=
uble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia second=
ary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keena=
n McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up wit=
h Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with =
the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risk=
y start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, bu=
t you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy ! Sm! ith  ,=
 WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing hi=
s second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any wee=
k in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still t=
alented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elv=
is Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph co=
uld break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sund=
ay. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other o=
ptions at running back.  M! arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lan=
ce Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tigh=
t end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,=
 you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrenc=
e Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start=
 in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While W=
ilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a=
 so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other=
 options at wide receiver. Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated=
 11/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of oppo=
nent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plu=
mmer downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Beegs =
Boys Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, =
and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin Jam=
es-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Cl=
ark , TE DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more pass=
es thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a ke=
y member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Co=
wboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to s=
tart one it should definitely be Clark.  More Updates  NFL Reports, Transac=
