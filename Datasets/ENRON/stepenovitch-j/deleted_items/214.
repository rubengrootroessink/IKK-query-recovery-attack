Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent =
Updated 11/15/01 Johnson will make his return Sunday. He has been sidelined=
 for over a month with a fractured collarbone. Don't expect him to be too p=
roductive. He will only be used in multiple-receiver sets.   Fred Taylor , =
RB JAC - Starboy Updated 11/15/01 It is unlikely that Taylor will play Sund=
ay against Pittsburgh. However, he is listed as questionable for Sunday's g=
ame. Taylor has been sidelined for over a month because of a groi! n ! inju=
ry.   Tony McGee , TE CIN - BCWD's Updated 11/15/01 McGee missed practice W=
ednesday because of a knee injury. However, he is expected to play in Sunda=
y's game against Tennessee.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - G money Updated 11/14=
/01 Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf in=
jury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury.   Frank Wycheck , TE T=
EN - El-! Ga! to Updated 11/14/01 Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The N=
ashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injur=
y. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's =
game.  Shad Meier , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Meier is still rec=
overing from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would =
have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played=
, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends.   Am=
os Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Zereoue is listed as ques=
tionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month becaus=
e of a shoulder injury.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/14/01 A=
n MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. Howev=
er, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain.   Mike McMahon , QB DET=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 According to published reports, the Lions ho=
pe to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not exp=
ected to play full-time, but this development means that Charlie Batch migh=
t lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.  Byron Chamber=
lain , TE MIN - Oper Error Updated 11/14/01 An MRI revealed a small cartila=
ge tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surg=
ery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free=
 to use him this week.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 11/14/01 =
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against pla=
ying this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Hei=
den is expected to start in his place.  Tim Dwight , WR SD - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/14/01 Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been =
very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production fro=
m him during the rest of the season.  Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/14/01 Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's ex=
pected to practice later in the week. He'll likely start his third consecut=
ive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday.  =
 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/14/01 Smith (knee) is listed=
 as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to=
 go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any =
further damage to his injured shoulder.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-s=
tyle Updated 11/14/01 Weinke (shou! ld! er) was only able to throw on the s=
idelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unabl=
e to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start.   Pey=
ton Manning , QB IND - El-Gato Updated 11/14/01 The Indianapolis Star says =
Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He i=
s expected to start on Sunday.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 11/1=
4/01 Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the=
 Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and prove he is ready to play by performing=
 well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to sta=
rt. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guar=
antee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game.  O.J. McDuffie , WR =
MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 McDuffie is ready to return to practice f=
rom the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may =
still miss the rest of the season.  Aaron Brooks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated =
1! 1/! 14/01 According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orlea=
ns roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this =
season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see J=
eff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coachin=
g staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarter=
back, so don't expect a change under center any time soon.    Cowboys , DT =
DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to =
miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury dur=
ing last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but th=
ey're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspec! ti! ve.   Jon Hilbert , =
K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Co=
wboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilb=
ert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so=
 don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues.   Tim Seder , K DAL=
 - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Seder is expected to miss several weeks of a=
ction after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has si=
gned former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties =
in Dallas.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Moore, who ha=
d hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesd=
ay. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don=
't bother picking him up off the waiver wire.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/14/01 Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more wee=
ks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't=
 advisable at this point.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14=
/01 Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left h=
and. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in =
his absence.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 McNair wi=
ll wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an=
 injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and ot=
her tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results=
 were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNa! ir! '=
s thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionab=
le for Sunday's game. "We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'=
ll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand," Fisher said.  =
   Ricky Watters , RB SEA - God Updated 11/13/01 According to the Seattle T=
imes, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. =
However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with=
 Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both player=
s until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half=
 of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.  Rod Smith , W=
R DEN - G money Updated 11/13/01 Smith predicted Monday that he will be abl=
e to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against W=
ashington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving =
option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling i=
n. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team=
's second wideout.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/13/01 K=
ennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unreti=
ring," according to the ! De! nver Post. While this is a radical turnaround=
 from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed =
back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear wheth=
er Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to t=
he roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any =
Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.  Cameron Cleeland , TE=
 NO - Tacos Updated 11/13/01 According to published reports, Cleeland won't=
 be available for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain=
 still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall =
to get the majority of the playing time in his absence.   More Updates  Tea=
ms Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated =
11/13/01 According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from=
 his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim=
 the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We =
recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will =
get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting i=
t will be Alexander.  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/13/01 Garcia made =
it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had=
 no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garci=
a will be able to play without the brace soon.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Up=
dated 11/11/01 The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Roo=
kie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there wil=
l be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.  J=
ames Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01 Jackson left Sunday's game in th=
e second quarter with an apparent injury to his left ankle. He was replaced=
 by Jamel White, and Jackson returned before halftime.  Troy Brown , Reserv=
e WR Updated 11/08/01 Brown should have a good game this week. The Patriots=
 should have little problem throwing the ball at home against Buffalo.  Ter=
rell Owens , Active WR Updated 11/08/01 Owens continues to be one of the to=
p wideouts in the league, catching nine passes for 125 yards and two scores=
 against Detroit last week. Owens has had some big games in the past agains=
t this week's opponent, New Orleans, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners=
.   Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 11/08/01 Wallas was held out of practi=
ce on Wednesday due to a hip injury. However, he is expected to play on Sun=
day against St. Louis.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01 Brady shou=
ld have another good outing this week. He shouldn't have much of a problem =
throwing the ball downfield in a home matchup with the Bills.  Qadry Ismail=
 , Active WR Updated 11/04/01 Ismail caught five passes for 53 yards at Pit=
tsburgh. While he did not score, Ismail performed well against a tough Pitt=
sburgh defense, and he has clearly emerged as a reliable Fantasy player.  S=
haun Alexander , Active RB Updated 11/04/01 Alexander rushed for 60 yards a=
nd a TD, and caught four passes for 42 yards at Washington. Even if opposin=
g defenses key on him, Alexander will always post respectable Fantasy numbe=
rs.  Tim Biakabutuka , Reserve RB Updated 10/25/01 Biakabutuka will be out =
until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to=
 his right foot. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that wou=
ld be football related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednes=
day. "Basically, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakab=
utuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be p=
ut back together." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the sta=
rting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said th=
e injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won'=
t play again.   Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered=
 a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However,=
 he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans=
.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor i=
n the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against=
 the underrated New England defense this week.  Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K=
 Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is ex=
pected to play against the Raiders.  Bills , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 De=
fensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third =
quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the=
 locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Buccaneers ,=
 Active DT Updated 08/08/01 Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended =
his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buc=
caneers, participated in practice on Wednesday.   John Carney , Active K Up=
dated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers mi=
ght be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent =
Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the of=
fer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, on=
e of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring =
leader with 1,076 points.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc an=
