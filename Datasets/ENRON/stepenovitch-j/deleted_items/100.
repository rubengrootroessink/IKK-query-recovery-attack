( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) From Russia With South African and
Australian Associates, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Norilsk, the Russian nickel mining corporation,
is taking its first step out of the home territories of the former
Soviet Union with its participation in the Nakety nickel project in
New Caledonia. The project is at present estimated to be worth in
excess of $500 million. Assisting in the generation of the project,
which was initiated by the Australian/Canadian company Argosy, is the
South African project development and process engineering group
Bateman Project Holdings who have worked with both of the other
project associates on previous ventures.
	   The relationship with Norilsk could grow for Bateman as the
Russians are said to be interested in base metal projects in Africa
and South Africa. The South African company has developed technologies
and management and marketing techniques to apply to the commercial
exploitation of a range of raw mineral mining projects in developing
countries. It is currently completing a $160 million gas compressor
plant in Turkmenistan, which is being followed by a similar plant in
Uzbekistan. Phosphates projects in the Middle East and Peru are also
under consideration. In Africa, it has the Skorpion zinc-mine
concentrator, refinery and smelter in Namibia, the SA Chrome project
in South Africa and diamond, cobalt and copper projects in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as the Corridor Sands project
in Mozambique.
