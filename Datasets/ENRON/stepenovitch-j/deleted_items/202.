- Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in h=
is surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He =
is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing =
on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE AT=

/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. H=
e wo! n'! t make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother startin=
g him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Hurricanes Updated 11/19/01 Lewis=
 suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The in=
jury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this=
 weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Up=
dated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, b=
ut the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. =
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Steve McNair , QB=
 TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury t=
o his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some pract=
ice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game=
.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained hi=
s left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week=
 11 game against Atlanta is un! cl! ear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Err=
or Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against=
 the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is a=
pparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, a=
nd Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook ,=
 WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yar=
ds and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner=
, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake=
 Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards=
, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances a=
re rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael P=
ittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited=
 Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't star! t ! Pittman in any =
upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET =
- Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of thr=
ee yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, w=
ho always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - =
Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona =
and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to f=
eature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making h=
im a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - =
Perrito-style Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against =
the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count o=
n Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He =
can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos=
 Updated 11/18/01! Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears,=
 but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down t=
he stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CH=
I - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tamp=
a Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantas=
y teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught sev=
en passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Bo=
oker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start eve=
ry week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yar=
ds. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fant=
asy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson=
 put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a tou!=
 ch! down. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, =
which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entir=
e preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Ward caugh=
t nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't=
 score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this yea=
r, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starb=
oy Updated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, th=
rowing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, startin=
g Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Upd=
ated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsb=
urgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners thi=
s season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a soli=
d outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He'=
s one of the top five Fantasy quarterb! ac! ks in the league and is a must-=
start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Rice had=
 a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touch=
downs against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller l=
eagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the mat=
chup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks wa=
s carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver wit=
h a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bo=
mbs Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falc=
ons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inc=
onsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a=
 must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/=
01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Ba=
y wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player=
.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at G=
reen Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remain=
s a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 6=
2 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian m=
akes a good backup RB right now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated=
 11/18/01!  Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four tim=
es by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year an=
d should not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos=
 Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Br=
owns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who shou=
ld give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.   More Updates [IMAGE]  C=
