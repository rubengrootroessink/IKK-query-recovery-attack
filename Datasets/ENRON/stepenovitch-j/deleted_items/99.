( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Huaneng Power International Announces
Plans for the Future, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Huaneng Power International, Incorporated (Beijing,
China) has announced its tenth five-year plan to be coordinated with
the construction of the China west-east natural gas pipeline. This
4,167 kilometers (2,604 miles) pipeline is still in the developmental
stages and is expected to start construction in the second half of
next year.
	   Huaneng Power plans the construction of two advanced combined
cycle gas turbine power plants in Jinling and Shanghai with a capacity
of 1,200 mega-watts (MW) each. It also has plans to continue to
develop large-scale mine-mouth coal-fired power plants adjacent to
coal mines with major road infrastructure in place. In addition to the
completion of the 1,320MW coal-fired Dezhou power plant, the company
also plans to expand its Shangan power plant with two 600MW coal-fired
units. If these projects are developed the power generated would be
4,920MW at a total cost of $3.2 billion, and it would raise Huaneng
Power's total generation capacity from its current 10,813MW up to
15,7335MW.
