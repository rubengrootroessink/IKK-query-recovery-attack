Montreal Purified Terephthalic Acid Plant, in an Advisory by

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 29, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). Interquisa Canada, a Spanish-Canadian joint
venture between Compania Espagnola de Petroleos' (Cepsa) chemical
division Interquisa (San Roque, Spain) and Societe Generale de
Financement's (SGF-Montreal, Quebec) subsidiary SGF Chemie has started
construction of a new Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) plant in
Montreal, Quebec. The new plant will have an initial capacity slated
at 500,000 metric tons per year and will directly employ approximately
140 people. Interquisa, the majority partner with a 51% interest and a
major European PTA producer, provided the technology for the plant.
	   PTA is the main raw material for the production of polyester
fiber, and is also used in tire cord, magnetic tape, plastic film, and
PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottles. Polyesters based on PTA are
used everyday in the packaging products of soft drinks,
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household and other products.
	   SNC-Dragados Industrial (Montreal, Quebec) is the construction
manager for the plant, which is expected to be in operation by late
2002. The paraxylene feedstock required for the production of PTA will
be provided from another SGF joint venture formed with Coastal
Petrochimie, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (Houston, Texas).
Coastal's 350,000 metric tons per year paraxylene unit, which was
shuttered in 1998, will be reopened at a cost of $135 million.
	   Interquisa, founded in 1972, is a subsidiary of Compania Espanola
de Petroleos (CEPSA), which is the second largest oil company in Spain
commanding 25% of the Spanish oil market. Interquisa, the only PTA
producer in Spain, also produces Dimethyl Terephthalate (DMT) and
Purified Isophthalic Acid (PIPA) at their plant in San Roque, Spain.
	   The Societe Generale de Financement (SGF) provides businesses with
development capital. SGF invests in partnerships, while assuming its
share of risk, by taking part in the management of every project it
supports. With a focus on Quebec's long-term economic development, SGF
chooses projects from natural resources to high technology and has an
investment potential of $2 billion over a five-year period.
