, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G=
 money Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolp=
hins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from his =
second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - El-Gato Up=
dated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone=
 in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money =
Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at=
 Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, s=
o be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Su=
nday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run =
defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11.   Anthony Thomas ,=
 RB CHI - El-G! at! o Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thoma=
s has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas i=
s nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting l=
ineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/23/01=
 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on ni=
ne carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   =
Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville! J! aguars=
 placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively end=
ing his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this ye=
ar before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET=
 - Tacos Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursd=
ay, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the p=
revious four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to=
 day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of=
-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before M=
ike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway t=
hrough the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effective=
ly because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.  =
  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a =
concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and=
 remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wed=
nesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative=
. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, wi=
ll start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 11=
/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a s=
prained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season.=
 Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every wee=
k.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back =
next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meni=
scus.  Olandis Gary, RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01Gary broke a bone in =
his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for t=
he rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell =
Davis might be able to return next week.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent =
Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini=
-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, an=
d he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/21/0=
1 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis=
' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start hi=
m every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent =
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats a=
nd may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated =
11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense=
 has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent wee=
ks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis.=
 He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, bu=
t only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell J=
ackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well=
 at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to =
open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiv=
er for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01Raiders=
 QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in the=
ir game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active=
 lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/0=
1 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Ty=
rone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run.=
 Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  Dav=
id Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01  Patten and the Patriots go up=
 against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long=
, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thoma=
s downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or=
 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a ve=
ry reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better=
 since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week =
for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - St=
arboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy o=
wners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sund=
ay, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oron=
de Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very incons=
istent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against th=
e Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into yo=
ur active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility McKnight could beat the =
Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth =
using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to ke=
ep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the B=
ills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Be=
egs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday a=
gainst the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of a disappointment, you=
 need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error U=
pdated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was=
 held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia =
in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lac=
k of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seatt=
le, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second w=
ideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Ri=
chardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a=
 goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a scor=
e against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with rel=
ative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he =
might be worth putting in your lineup.  More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  =
