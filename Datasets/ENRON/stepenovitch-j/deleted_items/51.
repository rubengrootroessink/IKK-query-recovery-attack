ell Davis  , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arth=
roscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surpris=
e Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture =
in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'm =
on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his rig=
ht knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team=
 the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was l=
isted as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR =
NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer =
might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jure=
vicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night a=
gainst the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head=
 coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.=
     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will m=
iss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards desc=
ribed Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be=
 extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various =
tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 2=
6-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during th=
e past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has=
 one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will=
 be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. =
   Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed wit=
h the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receive=
r to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowel=
l, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him u=
p.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to d=
ay with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against=
 Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Th=
e Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn pa=
tella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR=
 NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is =
still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. =
The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB =
GB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to g=
eneral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be full=
y recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - R-Diddy Upd=
ated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the=
 starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still work=
ing with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which pla=
yer will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster i=
s expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. F=
oster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagu=
es right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robin=
son  , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on =
injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectivel=
y ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil R=
ackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati=
 Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rac=
kers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his =
erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/24/01   Pin=
kston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He wil=
l be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent =
Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He=
 has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevic=
ius  , WR NYG - BCWD's Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his startin=
g position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jureviciu=
s was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be us=
eless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to star=
ting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this sea=
son. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game whil=
e Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent =
Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is ques=
tionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the t=
rainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for s=
ure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini an=
d Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Gallowa=
y  , WR DAL - Starboy Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable=
 for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic=
 about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We'r=
e expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionab=
le from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two =
or three days," said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is liste=
d as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering fro=
m a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/2=
4/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without an=
y problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watter=
s  , RB SEA - God Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune ,=
 Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the sta=
rting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longe=
r. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be=
 surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best p=
layer when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But =
I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have th=
e roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to =
ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the st=
retch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was=
 unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starti=
ng QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at th=
is point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/23/01   Hass=
elbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against=
 Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dil=
fer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. T=
his isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspectiv=
e, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday=
's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent=
 of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , W=
R MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to =
a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a=
 useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MI=
A - God Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle in=
jury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to=
 use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/01   =
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of=
 Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend y=
ou use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly=
 imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    =
Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Kar Bombs Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss hi=
s third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot.=
 Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Update=
d 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due=
 to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this we=
ek.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still ta=
rgeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthros=
copic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will acti=
vate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know b=
y Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a F=
antasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running=
 back and is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [I=
MAGE]   God Player News    Ricky Watters  , Injured RB Updated 10/23/01  Ac=
cording to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says=
 that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, w=
hich could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we com=
e to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky bac=
k into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexande=

y, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea =
to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the=
 job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Lamar Smith  , Active RB Upda=
ted 10/23/01  Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is s=
till expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this=
 week.    Az-Zahir Hakim  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  Hakim suffered a c=
alf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he =
is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   =
 Tim Biakabutuka  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Biakabutuka broke his foot=
 in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a t=
ouchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Troy B=
rown  , Reserve WR Updated 10/21/01  Brown had a huge game against Indianap=
olis, catching eight passes for 120 yards and a score. He continues to esta=
blish himself as a reliable Fantasy player, and may even better once Terry =
Glenn returns from a hamstring injury.    James Jackson  , Reserve RB Updat=
ed 10/21/01  Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, =
rushing for 77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back f=
rom a nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player.    =
Qadry Ismail  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Ismail will catch a few passes =
this week but don't expect him to score any touchdowns. He has just two TD =
receptions in five games.    Wesley Walls  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Wa=
lls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fa=
ntasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against =
Washington.    Ken Dilger  , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01  Dilger is not a m=
ajor factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much fro=
m him against the underrated New England defense this week.    Jeff Garcia =
 , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  According to published reports, Garcia has b=
een instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing =
again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a=
 few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start=
 in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago.    Rob Johnson  , Rese=
rve QB Updated 10/16/01  Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's=
 game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fant=
asy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change=
 this week. Don't use Johnson.    Terrell Owens  , Active WR Updated 10/14/=
01  Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 =
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Ow=
ens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best recei=
vers.    Shaun Alexander  , Active RB Updated 10/14/01  Alexander had anoth=
er great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denv=
er. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he=
 has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current le=
vel, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters retur=
ns.    Mike Vanderjagt  , Reserve K Updated 10/12/01  Vanderjagt (toe) kick=
ed in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.    =
Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday=
's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist inju=
ry. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and hi=
s return is questionable.    Buccaneers  , Active DT Updated 08/08/01  Line=
backer Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who =
has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practic=
e on Wednesday.    John Carney  , Active K Updated 04/15/01  Carney's 11-ye=
ar run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers sig=
ned San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet=
 Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey=

kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.   [=
