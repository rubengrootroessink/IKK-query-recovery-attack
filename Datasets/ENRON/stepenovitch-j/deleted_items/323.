, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Beegs Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai=
nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week=
s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti=
nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/25/01 M=
ack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards aga=
inst the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk becau=
se! o! f his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - God Updated 11/25/01 =
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet st=
atistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy t=
eam. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  J=
ason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yard=
s and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is tal=
ented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ro=
n Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six t=
imes for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers dur=
ing the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 11=
/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught fiv=
e passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners wou=
ld still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomli=
nson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zon=
e, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback h=
ad 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.=
   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, =
throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's on=
ly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB=
 ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01! Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, =
posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also thre=
w two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston =
, WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, cat=
ching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one =
of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting=
 on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/25/01 =
Jackson had a! g! ood outing against New England, catching five catches for=
 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiv=
er, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurric=
anes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes f=
or 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in re=
cent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=
AK - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley ca=
rried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often i=
n short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting =
for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he =
may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Sm=
ith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=
 and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=
me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 God Updated 11/25/01! Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posti=
ng 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fan=
tasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patri=
ots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/25/0=
1 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Gi=
ants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the mos=
t reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/25/01  Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggrav=
ating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not re=
turn to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Moulds=
 finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards =
and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should=
 still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year.=
 Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medioc=
re performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van P=
elt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interc=
eption. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he =
remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=
 not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable =
to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle=
r , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three =
TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk =
of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependab=
le Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/01 Th=
e Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TD=
s or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such=
 a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/=
01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington! . ! He is too=
 inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs appro=
ach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught fo=
ur passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considera=
bly in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy hom=
estretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter sa=
w extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems.=
 He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in=
 on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries=
.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place =
of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers =
in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7=
 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/25/01 Muh=
ammad missed ! Su! nday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. Hi=
s status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this tim=
e.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught =
two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open of=
ten, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays =
healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a=
 subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The F=
alcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reaso=
n for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G mone=
y Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return f=
rom a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a=
 Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  More Updates  Transactions, V=
