( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) RS Cogen LLC Targets August 2002
Completion Of 425MW Louisiana Cogen Project, in an Advisory by

    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 29, 2001--The following is an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston, Texas). Construction is well underway on RS Cogen LLC's 425
mega-watt (MW) cogeneration unit adjacent to PPG's Lake Charles,
Louisiana chemical complex. The new power facility has an anticipated
completion date of August 2002 and the total project cost is estimated
at $240 million. RS Cogen LLC will own the plant and PPG will operate
it.
	   RS Cogen LLC is a 50/50 joint venture formed between PPG
Industries (NYSE:PPG) (Pittsburgh, PA) and Entergy Wholesale
Operations (The Woodlands, Texas), the unregulated power development
division of Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) (New Orleans, LA).
	   Construction on the unit began in September 2000, with BVZ Power
Partners-Riverside, a Texas joint venture between Black & Veatch
(Kansas City, Missouri) and H.B. Zachary (San Antonio, Texas),
handling engineering, procurement, and construction. The natural
gas-fired, combined cycle power plant will have two
Siemens-Westinghouse 501F gas turbines, which provide higher kilowatt
output and lower environmental emissions than conventional systems.
Nooter Eriksen heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) and one Alstom
Power steam turbine generator will also be installed, along with a new
in-plant substation. Foxboro/Invensys will be supplying the I/A Series
control, data acquisition system and intelligent field
instrumentation.
	   PPG is expected to use 50% of the unit's electricity with the
remainder being sold to the wholesale power market. The plant will
also produce 250,000 pounds per hour of process steam for use at PPG,
and another 525,000 pounds per hour of process steam is to be
purchased by Lyondell Chemical Company (NYSE:LYO) (Houston, Texas).
	   PPG Industries was founded in 1883 and operates about 120 coating
material manufacturing and research & development facilities
worldwide. Sales in 2000 were $8.6 billion.
	   Entergy Wholesale Operations (EWO) has development and marketing
offices in London, Madrid, Milan and Sofia, Bulgaria. EWO has
approximately 10,000 megawatts of net capacity in operation,
development or under construction in North America and Western Europe.
