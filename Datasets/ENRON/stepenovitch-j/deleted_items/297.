, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of=
 a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respecta=
ble, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated =
11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on=
 Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to s=
tart him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a =
de! ce! nt Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you servicea=
ble stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona p=
ass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in=
 recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a we=
ekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good =
matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.=
  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should pla=
y very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game e=
arly on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a=
 key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/2=
1/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown down=
field in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into=
 your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Upd=
ated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants o=
n Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough=
 on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your =
roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Pat=
riots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent al=
l year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat=
 Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as yo=
ur No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown ha=
s been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only go=
tten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another =
solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith ,=
 RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for hi=
s Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defe=
nse on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a re=
sult.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been =
very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week=
 against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him b=
ack into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , =
WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility McKnight coul=
d beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is =
only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent =
Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Bu=
ffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league =
since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez ,=
 TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy sta=
ts Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of a disappoi=
ntment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - O=
per Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last we=
ek, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Ph=
iladelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him consider=
ing the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR K=
C - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday ag=
ainst Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by team=
s' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this wee=
k.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fa=
llen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll=
 get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ba=
ll with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only =
league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - =
R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks=
 off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good sta=
ts this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his =
struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Upd=
ated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but=
 should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats aga=
inst this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less m=
istake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito! -s! tyle U=
pdated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in=
 the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsiste=
nt prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gam=
ble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered =
useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this =
week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break h=
is slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has b=
een held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holdin=
g onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sund=
ay, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Sta=
rks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibi=
lity of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. Mc=
Cardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shoul=
dn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy ! Sm! ith  , WR JAC - R=
-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second st=
raight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your l=
eague. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented eno=
ugh to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph ,=
 RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break o=
ff some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However=
, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at r=
unning back.  M! arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Polla=
rd will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulter=
s on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in re=
cent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should=
 probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins ,=
 WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place o=
f the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins coul=
d get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Nine=
rs secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at=
 wide receiver. Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 H=
arrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. Howev=
er, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfi=
eld for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Beegs Boys Update=
d 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you sho=
uld definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like sta=
ts, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DE=
N - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown h=
is way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of=
 the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will =
likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it=
 should definitely be Clark.  More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]God =
Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01 Hakim suffered an=
 ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New England. He's listed as=
 questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay, so avoid starting him if=
 at all possible.   Troy Brown , Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been=
 a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten b=
etter since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid =
week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Wesley Walls , Active =
TE Updated 11/21/01 Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend=
, but he did find the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you'v=
e got a better option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable.   Qad=
ry Ismail , Active WR Updated 11/21/01 Ismail has become the Ravens' lead r=
eceiver this season, and is quickly developing into a very reliable No. 2 F=
antasy wideout. He is on a real hot streak and has a good history against t=
he Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get Ismail into your starting lineup t=
his week.  Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill=
 Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarte=
rback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew =
Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. =
Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but h=
e is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.  Ricky Watters , Injured RB Up=
dated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him=
 to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for anot=
her two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key p=
erformer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Terrell=
 Owens , Active WR Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and=
 ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina.=
 The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to =
be in the starting lineup on Sunday against Indianapolis.   Shaun Alexander=
 , Active RB Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another t=
wo to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending=
 Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some =
fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated=
 11/18/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Sm=
ith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start un=
less you lack depth at RB.  Stacey Mack , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 Mack =
was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not be=
en a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Jeff Gar=
cia , Active QB Updated 11/18/01 Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 =
yards and three touchdowns against Carolina. He's been one of the top three=
 Fantasy quarterbacks this season, and may even be more valuable than Peyto=
n Manning at this point.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 Jack=
son (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared =
carries in his place.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is =
not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect m=
uch from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Mike Va=
nderjagt , Active K Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on=
 Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.  Browns , Active DT =
Updated 09/23/01 The Browns allowed just 14 points during Sunday's game aga=
inst Detroit, and racked up two sacks and seven interceptions in the proces=
s. Cleveland's defense is a tad underrated and has some Fantasy value in de=
eper leagues, but keep in mind that the high interception total was mainly =
due to an ineffective game by Ty Detmer.  Buccaneers , Reserve DT Updated 0=
8/08/01 Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. =
Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participate=
d in practice on Wednesday.   John Carney , Reserve K Updated 04/15/01 Carn=
ey's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Ch=
argers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an o=
ffer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey.=
 If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most=
 accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 p=
oints.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com In=
