	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;

has begun work on a $27 million project to expand capacity at their
Riverside, California soft drink bottling plant.
	   Plans include the addition of a third hi-speed 1,000 unit per
minute bottling line that will fill 500 ml, 20 oz and 24 oz bottles
plus a 40,000 square foot warehouse and distribution building to
increase capacity by 10 million cases per year. In addition to the
expansion, a new syrup batching system and water system will be
installed along with utilities upgrades to handle the increase in
volume.
	   Saint Onge Ruff & Associates (York, Pa) has been selected as the
A&E firm and Camco Construction Inc (Salt Lake City, Ut) will provide
general contracting services on the project and is expected to be
completed by May 2002. The expansion represents the third major
investment in the plant since it was built in 1990.
	   The plant, located at 6659 Sycamore Canyon Boulevard in Riverside,
will also add 12 jobs to an existing workforce of about 450 people and
roughly three acres will be paved for parking areas and traffic
control purposes.
	   The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. is the world's largest seller,
manufacturer and distributor of Pepsi-Cola beverages with operations
