	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). China National Machinery & Equipment Import & Export
Corporation (CMEC) and China International Enterprise Co-operative
Corporation will build a $220 million hydroelectric power plant on the
Congo River at a site 215km from Brazzaville, the capital of the
Republic of Congo in central West Africa.
	   The contract to build the 120 mega-watt (MW) power plant will more
than double the country's present generation capacity of 89MW. Most of
the output will provide power for the capital. CMEC will be
responsible for design, construction and equipment for the plant,
which will be handed over on completion in 2006. The contract signed
between China and the Republic of Congo is the largest bi-lateral
economic and trade co-operation project between the two countries to
date.
