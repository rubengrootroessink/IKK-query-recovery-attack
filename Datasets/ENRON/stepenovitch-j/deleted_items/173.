 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato=
 Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Charger=
s. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett =
may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Upda=
ted 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play ha=
lf of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a=
 Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/16/01 =
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati d=
ue to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Fr=
iday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not bei=
ng 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Sm=
ith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup =
Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right k=
nee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith =
would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Ha=
mbrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against t=
he stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated=
 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday =
and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  Howev=
er, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this we=
ek, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consid=
ering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Perrito-style=
 Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starti=
ng quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not w=
orth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the l=
ack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the bett=
er quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in =
your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Starboy Up=
dated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's =
still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for findi=
ng the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen a=
nd the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y.=
 Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but i=
t's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fan=
tasy num! be! rs.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Willi=
ams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player =
to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been =
underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Broo=
ks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Fra=
ncisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit=
 inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it =
tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  =
  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a hug=
e game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards=
 receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable=
 to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.  =
 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error U! pd! ated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped=
 up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rus=
hing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fan=
tasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is=
 vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his =
last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver tea=
m that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in ve=
ry deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/=
16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three =
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this=
 weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is w=
orth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gard=
ner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passe=
s for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denve=
r, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az! -Zahir Hakim , WR STL -=
 God Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so start=
ing him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll=
 go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using hi=
m outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Oper Error Updated 11/=
16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only sco=
red only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secon=
dary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based=
 on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-Gato=
 Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, =
but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty L=
aw and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting =
based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy=
 Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he i=
s still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week=
, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Con=
well , TE STL - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so=
 starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack o=
f depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is someth=
ing many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , =
RB CAR - Kar Bombs Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this=
 weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries=
 with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible=
.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two =
catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable f=
or Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley =
Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the=
 last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the leagu=
e. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him=
 is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/16/01 Muhamm=
ad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards=
 against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's o=
pponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , Q=
B GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy qu=
arterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday =
with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bu=
bba Franks  , TE GB - BCWD's Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge ya=
rdage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable=
 Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is =
the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroede=
r , WR GB - Starboy Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the=
 NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He'=
s a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to =
strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in De=
troit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has=
 much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge =
gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will =
likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizon=
a. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a=
