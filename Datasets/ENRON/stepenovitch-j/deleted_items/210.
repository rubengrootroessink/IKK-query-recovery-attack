 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money=
 Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game agai=
nst the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear. =
 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for o=
nly 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the b=
all 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a=
 starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some w! or! =
k at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 We=
stbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defen=
ses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often=
 after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once b=
y Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have=
 a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/1=
8/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 ca=
rries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very t=
hin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caugh=
t two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate=
 for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie=
 Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed=
 for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a s=
core. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the=
 goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of =
the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caugh=
t 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yard=
s and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numb=
ers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.=
  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passe=
s for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone agai=
n. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin a=
t wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell cau=
ght one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consisten=
t enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M! arty Booker , WR CHI - BCWD's=
 Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at=
 Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout=
. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces=
.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limi=
ted Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still n=
ot proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD=
 - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against O=
akland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been =
down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact=
 that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against=
 Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid r=
eceiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable total=
s.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/18/01Flutie's recent struggles=
 continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he=
 faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   =
Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing ya=
rds on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the=
 Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Upda=
ted 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 =
yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in=
 the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - El-Gato=
 Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for=
 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every=
-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fa=
ntasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted ! of! f the field in the second quarter =
of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graha=
m.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 ya=
rds and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and=
 lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's pot=
ential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , W=
R GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yar=
ds against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be c=
onsidered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Update=
d 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs =
and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob =
Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 ya=
rds and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using=
 him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB rig! ht! now.  Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two=
 TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been =
a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.=
  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 y=
ards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unsp=
ectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the s=
tretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Hurricanes Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for =
only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland =
QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay ,=
 RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of=
 the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. H=
e displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth =
picking up if you need help at RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 1=
1/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel W=
hite shared carries in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - God Updated 11/1=
8/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith a=
ppears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless =
you lack depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/0=
1  The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.=
 Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.  More =
