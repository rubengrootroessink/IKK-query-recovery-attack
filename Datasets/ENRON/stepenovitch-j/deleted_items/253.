uld be able to play in the Saints' next game. His current status is day to =
day.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perri! to! -style Updated 10/29/01 According t=
o published reports, Dunn (hamstring) may return to practice later this wee=
k. But don't be surprised if his workload may be lessened a bit after Mike =
Alstott's performance against Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Tacos U=
pdated 10/29/01 Davis was inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed h=
e felt healthy enough to play. According to the Denver Post, there is no cl=
ear indication of when the Broncos will use Davis again. "He never practice=
d last week with the first team," Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan L! ea!   , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did =
not play on Sunday. As of now, it is not clear who will start for the Cowbo=
ys at New York. Clint Stoerner may have played well enough to get the call =
again next week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller =
(hip) will be further evaluated on Monday. According to some published repo=
rts, he should be available for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF =
- God Updated 10/29/01 Jo! hn! son injured his right foot in Sunday's game =
at San Diego. The injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hur=
t his elbow and shoulder.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/29/=
01 Pittman suffered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current st=
atus is day to day.  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 10/29/01 Stewar=
t was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started=
 at RB for the Lions.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 Jo=
hnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minneso=
ta Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday.=
 He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice =
last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson sa=
id. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know mor=
e tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in=
 pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Sm=
ith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the D=
allas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a littl=
e bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew wha=
t it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   =
But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he exp=
ects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith =
would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was =
walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 Acco=
rding to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's ga=
me against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. ! Eddie K=
ennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for=
 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideou=
t has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of product=
ivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rush=
ed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an=
 eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times f=
or 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson t=
his year.  David Patten, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught =
five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a sco=
ring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  =
Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 y=
ards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Br=
own will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on =
the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/0=
1 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Con=
way was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and st=
aying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy=
 wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcam=
e a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for fiv=
e yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now g=
et much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to pr! ef! er=
 his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone=
.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to=
 eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want=
 to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't ex=
pect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free =
Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at =
San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved e=
nough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - =
Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing=
 for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some=
 troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important=
 downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held =
Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consi! de! ring the strength of the Mi=
ami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumb=
led twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but t=
he league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden=
 , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 ya=
rds at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anyt=
hing more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle,=
 but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occ=
asionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Day=
ne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putt=
ing up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy tea=
ms right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer c=
aught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a m=
ust-start Fantasy player, no matt! er! what the opposition is.  Stephen Dav=
is , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards agains=
t the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running f=
or good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they =
are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/=
01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants=
. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy =
reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played =
Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three ca=
rries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raide=
rs' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it=
 bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, wh=
ich suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes=
 both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdo! wn! Sunday at Philade=
lphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured b=
