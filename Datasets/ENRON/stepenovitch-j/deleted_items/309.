, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G =
money Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's g=
ame at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, howe=
ver, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely st=
art Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a soli=
d run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. !  Anthony T=
homas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Th=
omas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thoma=
s is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the startin=
g lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/23=
/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on=
 nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.=
   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars=
 placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively end=
ing his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this ye=
ar before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET=
 - Tacos Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursd=
ay, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the p=
revious four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to=
 day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of=
-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before M=
ike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway t=
hrough the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effective=
ly because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.  =
  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a =
concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and=
 remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wed=
nesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative=
. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, wi=
ll start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 11=
/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a s=
prained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season.=
 Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every wee=
k.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back =
next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meni=
scus.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone i=
n his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for=
 the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrel=
l Davis might be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/21/01  Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a =
mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable=
, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/=
21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Be=
ttis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to star=
t him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a dec=
ent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable sta=
ts and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/21/01! Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass de=
fense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recen=
t weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly b=
asis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchu=
p, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darr=
ell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very=
 well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early o=
n to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key r=
eceiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01 R=
aiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield =
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your =
active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 1=
1/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on ! Su=
! nday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough o=
n the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your ro=
ster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patri=
ots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all =
year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat F=
red Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your=
 No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has =
been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gott=
en better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another so=
lid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , R=
B NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his =
Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defens=
e on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a resu=
lt.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been ve=
ry inconsi! st! ent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this we=
ek against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him=
 back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight =
, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight coul=
d beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is =
only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent =
Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Bu=
ffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league =
since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez ,=
 TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy sta=
ts Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointm=
ent, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper=
 Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week,=
 and was held out of the end zone on! ce! again. He may struggle against Ph=
iladelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him consider=
ing the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR K=
C - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday ag=
ainst Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by team=
s' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this wee=
k.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fa=
llen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll=
 get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ba=
ll with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only =
league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - =
R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawk=
s off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good st=
ats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his=
 struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Star! bo! =
y Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week=
, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stat=
s against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a l=
ess mistake-prone quarterback.  More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE] [IMAG=
