( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) First New Natural Gas Pipeline System
to Serve Florida in Over 40 Years is Under Construction, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Gulfstream Natural Gas System L.L.C. (Houston)
began construction on the 753 mile long Gulfstream pipeline in July of
2001. The pipeline originates near Pascagoula, Miss., and terminates
in Palm Beach County, Fla. When completed the 753 mile natural gas
transmission pipeline will consist of 431 miles of 36" diameter
offshore pipeline and 306 miles of varying diameter (16" to 36")
onshore pipeline mostly located in Florida. The massive pipe weighs
eight tons per 40-foot section.
	   The support facilities for this $1.6 billion venture include a
natural gas processing plant and a 120,000 horsepower compressor
station near Coden, Ala. Approximately 200 miles of the offshore
portion have been laid by three lay barges and the compressor station
was 17 percent complete as of Oct. 1, 2001. Similar progress has been
made on the onshore portion in Florida.
	   Once completed in June 2002, Gulfstream will be the largest
pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico and will initially transport 1.1
billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to supply Florida's growing
gas-fired electrical generation needs. This new pipeline will help
satisfy Florida's need for 25 percent more electrical generation by
2007 and the 179 percent increase in demand for natural gas over the
next decade.
	   Gulfstream Natural Gas System L.L.C. is a joint energy development
between Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Williams
(Tulsa, Okla.) is a $32 billion energy company delivering 16 percent
of all natural gas consumed in the U.S. through a network of over
27,000 miles of pipelines. Duke Energy (Charlotte, N.C.) is a diverse
energy company with revenues of over $22 billion in 2000.
