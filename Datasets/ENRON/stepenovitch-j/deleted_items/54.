( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Russians and De Beers Cutting a Diamond
Supply Deal, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Looking to assure themselves of a minimum of
$500 million worth of rough Russian diamonds per annum, De Beers
(Johannesburg, South Africa) is looking to sign a long term agreement
on diamond marketing in December when the current agreement expires.
The Russians favor a deal between De Beers and the Russian diamond
company Alrosa thus being able to protect and control the adequate
supply of rough diamonds to the home industry and enable it to work
profitably.
	   Reports say that an agreement has been drafted and details are
being ironed out between the Russians and the South Africans. Over the
last two years, De Beers purchased around $1 billion of rough stones
in Moscow and they need the supply to maintain the variety they offer
clients. In the specialized world of diamond supply and demand
negotiations, De Beers does not want the Russian cutters to have sole
first rights over the best stones coming from the mine.
	   De Beers, the world's leading diamond producer was acquired
earlier this year by DB Investments and is currently delisted from the
JSE and LSE.
