Did you watch the same game I saw?  Apparently not.  The Horns looked awesome.  Alot better than that team you root for.  You wish you went to UT, don't you?!

Did you have a good time last night?  Find a cute little Texas girl to fall in love with?  There are plenty of them in Austin.  If I hear no stories, I know you had a really good time.
