Good Afternoon,

Could you please forward my vacation schedule to Dana Davis.  I will be taking December 17th through January 1st off from work.  Bryce Schneider will be covering my trading responsibilities while I am on vacation.  Also, I would like to rollover my additional week into the new company, leaving me with 40 hrs in which I will give up this year.  If you have any questions please let me know.  

Thank you,

-Joe Stepenovitch
