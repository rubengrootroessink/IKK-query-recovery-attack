Hello Jonda,

I know your getting ready to go on vacation and I just wanted you to know that I called the credit card companies and had them mail me my YTD statements.  They would not fax it.  So, I would just attach a letter saying were waiting on the companies or leave it blank (N/A).

Anyway, she sent me another e-mail and I have not replied to any of them just to let you and Mr. Fulenweider know.  Have a great vacation..you deserve it!!

-Joe

Hello, I just wanted to say I hope your weekend  went well.  Payton is growing like a weed.  He is now tickalish.   He also has learned how to scream, now that's about all he does.  He has a  walker and he loves to sit in it and just talk away.  He is such a happy  baby, everyone enjoys him and loves to see him, he's so pleasant.
