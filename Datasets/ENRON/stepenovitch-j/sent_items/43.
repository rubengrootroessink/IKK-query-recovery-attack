Joe-

I can't guarantee what time he will call today, but it will have to be
between appointments.  As he will be at a seminar all next week, his
appointments were scheduled VERY tight this week, along with three days of
depositions which have been scheduled for over 2 months.  It may not be
until this evening.  He has your work and cell phone numbers.

Fullenweider will be calling so I can give you the phone number.  I leave

Thanks again,

   Jonda,

   I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me
   and
   my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I
   have
   cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails
   (trying
   to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do
   that
   so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will
   forward
   them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I
   really
   think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she
   is
   mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

   Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
   over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury
   trial?
   Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something
   to
   Tonya?  I don't understand....

   I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for
   work
   (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after
   3:30.
   I hope that helps

   Thanks again,

   -Joe

      Dear Joe,

      I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back
      meetings,
      hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a
   short
      telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition
      schedule
      may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge
   rules
      at a
      hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court,
   I
      could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

      I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery
      responses
      because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

      Jonda

      Good Morning Jonda,

      I would like to met with Mr. Fullenweider today if that is possible?
      I'm
      going out of town Thursday thru Sunday of this week.  I think it is
   very
      important that I speak with him as soon as possible.  Please let me
   know
      if
      today is good for him.  Thanks again,

      -Joe

         Dear Joe,

         Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at
   about
      3:00
         p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you
   could
         come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my
      son's
         soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for
      you???
