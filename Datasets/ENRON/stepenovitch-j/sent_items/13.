Good Morning Jonda,

Please send a reply fax to Miryam and let Tonya now the reason my own son does not know me better is because she won't let him see his own father.  As for the visitation, I hope this will soon end with her making all of the decisions but in the mean time I will talk to my family to see what is best.  I know if I choose to see him on Sunday, I would need to see him in the morning from 9 to 12:00. My flight is @ 5:30 and I'm 3 hours away from the airport.  I will let you know sometime this afternoon or first thing in the morning.

Thank you,
-Joe

Dear  Joe:
 
See the attached email  from Miryam Mitchell at Stewart Gagnon's office.  Please let me know if you  agree to their suggested visitation times.  If you need to fly out earlier  on Sunday which would prevent you having him until 4:00, I'll explain that to  Miryam and suggest 1:00 to 7:00 on Saturday and 1:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Or  1:00 to 6:00 on Saturday and 12:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Let me know which  you prefer.
 
It appears that Tonya is  willing to give you increased access to Payton as he gets older and as he gets  to know you better.  I know this has been a frustrating process for  you.  I think (it is not my legal opinion since I'm not an attorney) that  it would be beneficial to request an extra hour or two at each visitation so  that we work up to overnights.  I know it can't be soon enough for you, but  small steps are always an improvement in the right  direction!!
 
Let me know about the  visitation and where you want to meet Tonya.  At your hotel?  Will you  be taking him out of Merritt Island?
 
Jonda

Jonda,
 
Tonya does not agree to  1 - 8 on Saturday and also from 1 - 3 on Sunday.
 
However, she's willing  to make a compromise suggestion as follows:
 
The visitation on   Saturday from 1 - 4 and again from 6 - 8 is a total of 5 (five) hours.   Rather than Joe having to  pick up Payton twice and deliver him twice on Saturday, Tonya  suggest that Joe take Payton from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, and again from  1:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.
 
She would also like  written confirmation of exactly where Joe wants to meet to pick up Payton and  exactly where he will deliver Payton back to her.
 
Tonya also like to know, if Joe accepts the  5-hour visitation on Saturday, whether Joe intends to take Payton outside  of Merritt Island, and if so where.  It is not her intent to prevent Joe's  doing so, she simply wants to know if Payton is going to be traveling out of  town.
 
Can we agree on the  foregoing?
