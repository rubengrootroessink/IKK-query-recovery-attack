Joe,

My name is Castlen Moore, and I work with Narsimha Misra on the EES desk.  Anna Santucci and I are managing the Nepool hedging for EES, and Narsimha mentioned you might have a spreadsheet that could be helpful to us.  He said he thought it was pulling info daily from the web on various fundamentals.  Give me a call or email me when you have a minute.  Anything on Nepool would be greatly appreciated by Anna and I.

Thanks!
Castlen
