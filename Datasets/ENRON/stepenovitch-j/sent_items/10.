That is your call.  I can't read your mind.  I think,  I'm doing the right thing for my son win or lose!  I'm sure you or dad would do the same thing if you were in my shoes.  I have not talked to her at all, so I don't know what her reaction will be.  She seems to like you....

I guess in the scheme of things one of the reasons you try not to go to
trial is to prevent this from happening.  Plus it takes a long time to
prepare for the case and it looks like your attorney wants to win.  Do you
want me to call Tonya and explain to her that going forward things are not
going to be pretty.  I think I can do this in a gentle and concerning way.
Or should I not be involved?
Love,
Mom
