Good Morning Beth,

Sorry I didn't get back in touch with you last week, but I was in Las Vegas.  If you would could you please answer these questions or If you want you can call my mother directly (its your call).  Let me know what you decide...  Have a nice day.

-Joe

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.
