Any more news on next week? Are you still flying in at 10:00 pm. I want to let mom know a little in advance if you want to go to Vero.  I cannot believe Larry Dierker resigned, although he probably would have been fired anyway.  This Saturday is full of great games and of couse I have to work until 2:00, ridiculous.  Later

What's up? 
I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you 
don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him 
for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you 
think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I 
find out I'll let you know. 
Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the 
UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)

   Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a 
   little while and she said you might be coming into town. 
   The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is 
   being reasonable again.
