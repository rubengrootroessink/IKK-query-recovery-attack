Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probable with a h=
amstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Sti=
ll, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk =
of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outrig=
ht for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent =
Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntle=
y will enter Week Seven a! s ! the team's starting tailback. "He has progre=
ssed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here's a g=
olden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he=
 looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting R=
B job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered=
 a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will=
 prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next=
 Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week =
before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB=
 - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Su=
nday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be=
 limited in practice this week and ! co! uld miss next Sunday's game agains=
t Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare you=
r lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/=
22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against=
 Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in," Bu=
cs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times. "Warrick pulled a m=
uscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carry=
ing the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful=
 considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Fav=
re , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Favre i! nj! ured his right elbow i=
n the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers=
 have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. "It'll b=
e OK," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "Thank goodness I have a =
week to relax. I think that will help."  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Upd=
ated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth qu=
arter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont W=
arren finished the game in his absence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato =
Updated 10/22/01 Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cinci=
nnati, the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bears will continue to use an a=
lternating system with him and ! Ja! mes Allen. "We will continue to use th=
em both," said offensive coordinator John Shoop. "Anthony did a great job t=
oday, though." As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to=
 recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thoma=
s is the better long-term pick, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. T=
he injury is not believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He mig=
ht get some carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the s=
eason.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned=
 from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD recept=
ion in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's still not a reliable w=
eekly starter in a Fantasy league.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/22/01 Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to=
 a 24-yard reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson wil=
l be evaluated on a daily basis.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated=
 10/22/01 Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not c=
onsidered to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD r=
eception. Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR=
 CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/! 01!  Terrell will start at wide receiver =
in place of injured Marcus Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco.=
 If you're a Robinson owner, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The roo=
kie had seven receptions for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/22/01 According to published reports, the Bengals are b=
ecoming frustrated with Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into sig=
ning another kicker.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Jo=
nes sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status i! s ! day to day=
.  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised =
ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against=
 Detroit.  J.R. Redmond , RB NE - G money Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his=
 return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He =
won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB B=
AL - Beegs Boys Updated 1! 0/! 22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusi=
on. His status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would =
start if Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22=
/01 Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltim=
ore Sun, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's stat=
us as a starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent =
Updated 10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He wi=
ll be evaluated on a daily basis.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent =
Updated 10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries=
 Sunday and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at=
 full strength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return f=
rom their bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated=
 10/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in =
the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again =
until November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-G! at! o Updated 10/22/01 Bru=
ce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily=
 a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so th=
ey didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better nex=
t week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Free Agent Updated =
10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore=
 the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. =
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the=
 second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry Fo=
ster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus Robinson ,=
 WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruc=
iate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's w=
in over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robins=
on had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half a=
fter the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receiver in his absence. =
 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Richardson (shoulder=
) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had=
 one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used s=
paringly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featur=
ed back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 10/22/01 Williams, who w=
as averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21 carries Sunday, =
a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the second half. "W=
e couldn't do anything in the second half," Williams said. "We didn't block=
 right a few times, other times they filled holes and made plays." Look for=
 Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams this Sunday.   =
 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 10/22/01 Chandler had another so=
lid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also compl=
eted 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter =
for the rest of the season.   Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - God Updated 10/22/=
01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after =
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is =
out for the season.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01=
 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffectiv=
e at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to=
 prove himself as a Fantasy player.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 =
