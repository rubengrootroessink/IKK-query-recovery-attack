	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following in an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Groupe SNPE (Paris, France) announced
plans on December 10, 2001 to regulate and improve safety at it three
plants in Toulouse, France. SNPE announced that it would spend several
million francs to improve plant safety at it Toulouse facilities. The
plan includes the formation of a commission of local delegates with
the authority to order investigations and acquire knowledge about
safety issues relating to the three plants. Included in SNPE's plan is

people regarding industrial site proximity to residential areas. On

residents to tour. Tours involved explanations of SNPE's manufacturing
process as well as the practical applications of their products.
