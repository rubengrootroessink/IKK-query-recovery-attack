Hi Joe-
I am Suzette's friend-the one looking for jobs (on the sly of course) in the greater Tampa and/or St. Petersburg area.  She had suggested I send my resume to you for potential contacts at FPL and Bank of America.  

I am currently in the associate program but have a 'unique' concentration.  I was hired into the marketing track and have focused mainly on those areas here at Enron.  Let me know if you have any questions for me-here's a recent copy of my resume which includes my latest rotation.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,
Beth Peters
