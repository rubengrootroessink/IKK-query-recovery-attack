   Any more news on next week? Are you still flying in at 10:00 pm. I want 
   to let mom know a little in advance if you want to go to Vero.  I cannot 
   believe Larry Dierker resigned, although he probably would have been 
   fired anyway.  This Saturday is full of great games and of couse I have 
   to work until 2:00, ridiculous.  Later

   What's up? 
   I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you 
   don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get 
   him 
   for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
   him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
   him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what 
   you 
   think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon 
   as I 
   find out I'll let you know. 
   Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for 
   the 
   UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)

      Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a 
      little while and she said you might be coming into town. 
      The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is 
      being reasonable again.
