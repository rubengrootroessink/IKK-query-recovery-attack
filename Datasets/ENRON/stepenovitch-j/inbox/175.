Kar Bombs Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report =
with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game agai=

ck, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TE=

due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game aga=

ep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 12/29/=
01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acqu=
iring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarter=
back, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move=

 be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money =
Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game=

 play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis=
 has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He=

 Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing th=
