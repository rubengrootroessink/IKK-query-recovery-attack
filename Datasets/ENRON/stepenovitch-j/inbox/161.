12/26/01 Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose se=
parated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach Mike Holmgren s=
aid Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since t=

ere's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situ=
ation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Ta=
cos Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His statu=
s for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updat=

or may have to start again.   Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/2=
6/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, an=
d may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular wor=

er Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched =
late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointmen=
t this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the pos=
tseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thum=
b) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for=
 this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.   Wesl=

 second consecutive game this week. Chris Chambers may start in his place a=
gain.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Taylor (groin) has =
returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear i=
n the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed=
 too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this poi=
nt of the playoffs.   Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 12/26/01 Smith (=
ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week.   Raghi=
b Ismail , WR DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 12/26/01 Ismail is recovering from a=

L - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He i=

ll is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week=

me practice time this week with a foot injury. His status for this week's g=
ame is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't=
 play.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Brookins may be a=
ble to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Will=
iams will continue to split carries.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Upd=
ated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may=
 be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Betti=
s is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Stewart=
 , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early =
in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the fir=
st quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos =
Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not =
expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Upda=
ted 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored br=
eathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-inju=
red his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesl=
ey Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's=
 game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after s=
praining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/23/0=
1 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The Bucc=
aneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.  Todd Bouman=
 , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable fo=
r Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may=
 play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updat=
ed 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the=
 death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Gr=
aham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner wi=
ll be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their=
 No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   An=
towain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-h=
igh 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners=
 in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     More Update=
s   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Wesley Walls , Active TE Up=
dated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to=
 play this week.   Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose p=
ractice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted a=
fterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying i=
t didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in=
 the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Az-Za=
hir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Hakim has a sore back. He is expect=
ed to play against Carolina.   Troy Brown , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Brow=
n has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reli=
able option during the Fantasy playoffs.   Terrell Owens , Active WR Update=
d 12/21/01 Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to =
play this week.   Stacey Mack , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 Mack has produc=
ed an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't scored a lot. He sh=
ould be used in larger leagues only for the remaining weeks.   Qadry Ismail=
 , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Ismail has been a reliable receiver all seas=
on. Look for this trend to continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs.   Jame=
s Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on=
 injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson, who leads the team with 554 yards ru=
shing, will miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated=
 a left ankle sprain in the first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Ja=
cksonville Jaguars and left the game with two carries for six yards. Benjam=
in Gay and Jamel White will share carries in his absence, but neither are r=
eliable players to use during the Fantasy playoffs.   Ricky Watters , Injur=
ed RB Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not p=
lay again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's fi=
nal three games.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 12/18/01 DT Warren Sapp (=
shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured during Sunday's=
 loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this week, but should be=
 available for Week 15.   Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 12/17/01 A se=
ason-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man in S=
eattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in the =
team's final three games.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Smith =
carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has bee=
n very inconsistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD =
runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   Mike Vanderjagt , Rese=
rve K Updated 12/16/01 Vanderjagt (back) is healthy enough to handle all th=
e kicking duites for Indianapolis this week. As a result, the team released=
 Doug Brien, who was used in last Monday night's loss to Miami.   Tom Brady=
 , Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01 Brady had another disappointing game, throwi=
ng for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, t=
he New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during the most important we=
eks of the year.  Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 11/30/01 Dilger has been =
a major disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. With Marcus Pollard =
emerging as the Colts primary tight end, Dilger has very little Fantasy val=
ue.   Browns , Reserve DT Updated 09/23/01 The Browns allowed just 14 point=
s during Sunday's game against Detroit, and racked up two sacks and seven i=
nterceptions in the process. Cleveland's defense is a tad underrated and ha=
s some Fantasy value in deeper leagues, but keep in mind that the high inte=
rception total was mainly due to an ineffective game by Ty Detmer.  John Ca=
rney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San=
 Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers rest=
ricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a we=
ek to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll s=
upplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego=
's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commi=
