Here's a neat opportunity to share some of your club's great Seminole
spirit!

Mike Palios is in charge of the parade this year, and together, Mike and I
are jointly extending this special invitation to ALL clubs to please join us
for the Sesquicentennial parade of Nov. 9th!

Please let me know if you are coming, for I might be able to help with
decorating your cars, and will ALSO want to hook up with each during
Saturday's pregame reception behind Garnet and Gold on Pensacola Street,
AFTER THE HOMECOMING breakfast Saturday AM.

We are strongly suggesting that if you ARE coming, bring your club banner,
and we can use bungee cords to attach it to the front of your cars!!!!!

If you or ANY of your club membership is coming in for Homecoming, sincerely
hope that your arrival will be in time to join the parade.

Thanks!

Best,

Terry

Club Presidents:

Here is your chance to get the entire FSU and Tallahassee Community to know
who you and your Club is.

This yesar, on Friday, November 9, 2001 at 1:50PM, the Sesquicentennial
Homecoming Parade will start, heading east on Call Street, turning right
(south) at Monroe Street, heading south to College Avenue and making the
final turn right, heading west, and ending at Westcott Fountain.  Line Up
for the Parade begins at 12 Noon at the Fine Arts building parking lot.

I have attached the Parade Confirmation form, if you are interested.  You
will be responsible to get your own car (I suggest getting a convertable if
possible!) and bring your Club banners so everyone knows who you are!  If
you don't have a Club banner, let me know immediately and we can make a sign
to put on the side of the cars.

Please contact me if you have any questions at all, and I hope to see many
of you that day!

Go Noles!
