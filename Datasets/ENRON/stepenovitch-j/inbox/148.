( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Forest Products Industry Shows
Signs of Getting Out of the Woods in Late 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). The year ahead will be challenging for America's forest
products industry, much like 2001. Weak demand for some products
combined with a sluggish economy will continue to plague the industry
through most of 2002. Getting out of the "woods" will be determined by
how well manufacturers match production to demand, more industry
consolidation and by limiting capital spending.
	   Capacity expansion is mostly non-existent and growth will be less
than 1%, as plants will still have to contend with production
curtailments through the first half of 2002. Producers have indicated
that machines will no longer run outright, but instead run closer to
demand. By the third quarter of next year, producers expect to see a
significant reduction in high inventories that could trigger long
awaited price increases.
	   Industry consolidation has become necessary for growth as well as
a way to survive in a global marketplace. More mergers and
acquisitions are in line for the industry next year. In the midst of
shuffling manufacturing assets, business groups and marketing
strategies, more of the country's plants will close permanently.
Additionally, consolidation will lead to some U.S. plants falling into
the hands of foreign companies. For some plants, new ownership could
mean an injection of much needed capital investments.
	   Industrial Information Resources recently published 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm),
available on CD-ROM, projects a whopping 20% decline in capital
spending compared to 2001. Though seemingly dismal, spending will be
sustained by environmental projects, the need to replace aging
equipment and by investments that yield high returns in the short
term.
