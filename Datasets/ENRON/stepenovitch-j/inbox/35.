I think I will give her a call if you agree.  Joylyn's number is
561-309-0726.  Dad and I will be going to Disney at the Hyatt Regency the
long weekend of Friday November 9-11 and would like you and Payton to join
us.  Saturday is a free day for us as well as Sunday.  My event is Friday
night and Saturday night.
