test NFL Player News   Seahawks , DT SEA - G money Updated 12/31/01 CB Shaw=
n Springs did not make the trip to San Diego for Sunday's game against the =
Chargers. He has yet to be added to the team's active roster, and is questi=
onable for Week 17 against Kansas City.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money=
 Updated 12/31/01 Gramatica missed Saturday's game against Baltimore due to=
 a leg injury. He will attempt to practice on Wednesday, but early indicati=
ons seem to point to Doug Brien handling the kicking duties in Week 17.  Fr=
ank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Wycheck left Sunday's game =
against Cleveland in the first quarter due to a thigh bruise. He did not re=
turn to the game and is listed as day to day.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - =
Oper Error Updated 12/31/01 According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , H=
asselbeck (shoulder) hopes to play in Seattle's season finale. However, it =
seems more likely that Trent Dilfer will start for the second consecutive w=
eek.  Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - BCWD's Updated 12/31/01 Jurevicius suffered=
 bruised ribs during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He was able to fin=
ish the contest, but was held to only one catch for 18 yards.   Tiki Barber=
 , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 12/31/01 Barber suffered a slightly sprained an=
kle during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He was able to finish the co=
ntest, and compiled 158 all-purpose yards in the Giants' 24-21 loss.   Step=
hen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12/31/01 Davis suffered a sprained =
ankle during Sunday night's win over New Orleans. He was removed from the g=
ame for precautionary measures, and is expected to start in Week 17 against=
 Arizona.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Buckhalt=
er suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 24-21 win over the N.Y. Giants.=
 The rookie tailback is listed as day to day.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free=
 Agent Updated 12/31/01 Minor got most of the carries during Sunday's 21-14=
 win over Atlanta. The rookie compiled 98 all-purpose yards and a touchdown=
 in the game, and may have overtaken Lamar Smith as Miami's featured back. =
  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 12/31/01 Zereoue suffered a sh=
oulder injury during Sunday's game against Cincinnati. He left in the first=
 quarter and did not return to the contest. He is listed as day to day.   F=
red Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Baxter suffered a spraine=
d ankle during Sunday's 24-0 win over Detroit. He is listed as day to day. =
  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Byrd suffered a concuss=
ion and a leg bruise during Sunday's 30-7 loss to Arizona. He may be listed=
 as questionable for Week 17 against New England, but his current status is=
 day to day.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Hayes su=
ffered a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against Arizona. He could be l=
isted as questionable for Week 17 against New England, but his current stat=
us is day to day.  Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Kell=
y suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's 21-14 loss to the Miami Dolphi=
ns. He was unable to return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Chr=
is Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Chandler left Sunday's game=
 against Miami in the second quarter after suffering an injury to his right=
 elbow. X-rays were negative, but Chandler did not return to the game. He i=
s listed as day to day.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/30/01=
 Bettis has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. C=
hris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar=
 Bombs Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report wit=
h a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against=
 Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback,=
 Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN -=
 Beegs Boys Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due=
 to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game agains=
t Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game aga=
inst Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fa=
ntasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel=
 (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too ri=
sky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhamma=
d , WR CAR - G money Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play thi=
s week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start i=
n his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - G money Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn=
 Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sund=
ay against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing =
time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12=
/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb inju=
ry. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pa=
ckers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last=
 week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep i=
nto the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 12/29/01 A=
ccording to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquirin=
g Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback=
, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move wou=
ld certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be =
made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Upda=
ted 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, al=
though the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. E=
ven if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warri=
ck Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to da=
y with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has=
 been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westb=
rook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day w=
ith a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR =
ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive g=
ame with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Ari=
zona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/=
01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to pla=
y this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc an=
