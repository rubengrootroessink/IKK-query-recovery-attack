Joe, just wanted to give you and update on how  Payton is.  He is growing like a weed, he is now 16lbs and 5 ozs.  His  hair is getting thicker, I had to trim his hair over his ears because it was  getting long enough to tuck it behind his ears He is learning very fast, he can  move really well in his walker when he is on smooth flooring and he is praticing  everyday to sit up and crawl, it want be long.  He still talks alot and  never cries, he is such a wonderful baby.  He can turn around on his back  in a 360 turn and he can roll across the room, if nothing is in his  way. Wel, he is ready for me to get him out of his bed, I better  go!!
 
He looks forward to visiting with you  soon!
