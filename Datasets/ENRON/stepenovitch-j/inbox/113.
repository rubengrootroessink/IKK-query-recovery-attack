Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.
