( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Petroleum Refining Industry Can
Expect a 5% Growth in 2002 for Capital and Maintenance Spending, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (industrial Information Resources
Incorporated: Houston ). According to the recently released 2002
Industrial Outlook, the U.S. Petroleum Refining industry is expected
to see an increase of 5% in annual capital and maintenance spending
for 2002. This increase in spending is partially a result of
environmental compliance issues requiring refineries to produce
cleaner fuels and reduce Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP's).
	   The spring and summer of 2001 brought unusually high gasoline and
crude oil prices, delaying many planned maintenance turnarounds.
However, in the late summer and early fall of 2001, the high prices
retracted which led to the acceleration of many of the late fall
planned turnarounds. 2001 capital spending focused on the
implementation of new technologies and process changes to increase
product yields. With a less than optimistic outlook for margins in
2002, spending could likely be isolated to environmental and
maintenance programs for the coming year. These topics and more are
included in the recently released 2002 Industrial Outlook published by
Industrial Information Resources and available on CD-ROM.
