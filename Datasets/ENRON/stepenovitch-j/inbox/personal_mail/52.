Just a follow up message.

Yes, I do have instant messanger, but I really don't know how to use it.  I
mean, I know how to use it once it's set up, but I don't know how to put a
new buddy on the list, nor do I know what my sign on is for it.  I'll have
to ask Michael how to do it when he gets back from Atlanta.  Anyways,  I'll
be home today until about 3 pm and then again after about 5pm.  If you can
and want to, call me.

PS  I have a new cell phone number.  It's 813.732.3260
