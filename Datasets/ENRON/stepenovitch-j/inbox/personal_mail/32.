Stewart, Joe would like to talk to Tonya before she leaves Houston to set up
a dialog and line of communication to help facilitate further communication
between them. He will need her phone number where by he can call her in
Florida. He also wants to see his child and is most anxious to see his son
as soon as possible. either this weekend on no later then next. I don't see
the need for supervised possession under the currents situation as was
suggested in you earlier arrangement.   I would like to set up a formal
program for routine possession hopefully before she leaves. Please call me .
Donn
