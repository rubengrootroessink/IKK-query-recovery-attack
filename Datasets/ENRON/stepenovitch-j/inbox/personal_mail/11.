Good Afternoon Brian,

How have you been?  I'm doing great.  I never got a chance to thank you
and your co-worker for the coffee mug.  Also, I wanted to thank you
again for dinner that night.  I still can't believe they acted that way.
Anyway, I should get my promo to Mgr at the end of the year so we'll
need to stay in touch and I might be in Hot-Lanta soon as well.


Well I think you talked to my friend Keller today and he wanted me to
forward you his resume.  I hope you and set him up with something.
Gotta run have a good holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

-Joe Step Jr.
