I would like to offer a different perspective on the attacks that occurred
last Tuesday. It's view of the forest that I don't think the press has not
gotten to in it's coverage so far.

The American reaction to this has been healthy and accurate. After reading
books on Normandy, Iwo Jima, I always wondered if the US still possessed a
fire in it's belly to stoke if someone should ever deliver a blow like
this. So far so good, but can it be sustained to go the distance? While the
media focuses on the personal tragedy and how to cope with what HAS happen,
maybe we should get in touch with our courage as well as our emotions to
deal with what MAY happen.

In my opinion is that the US has been provoked into a larger scheme.
Whoever did this not only expects the US to launch counter attacks, they
are betting on it. And they are betting that the US won't go it alone. They
are betting that  Western intervention in the Mid East will destabilize the
region, possibly the world, and that will ultimately bring the demise of
Israel. That is what these fanatics are ultimately after.

As you know, we've fought in the mid east before, but this time it will be
different in many ways. If the West opts for a militarily engagement (and I
would be shocked if they didn't) they will not have the coalition they did
for the Gulf War. Many of the Arab countries that were on board during
Desert Storm will not be able to internally support Western counter attacks
that will be frequent, massive and multinational.

Of course we should expect that these terrorist factions to volley their
own counter attacks back against the US. Retaliatory strikes from terrorist
may not be as spectacular as what happened last Tuesday, but they will be
just as ugly. They have many unspeakable options.

The terrorists that perpetrated the attacks on Tuesday, have calculated
that we, the American people, can not stomach a long, drawn out, ugly,
conflict. Sadam Hussein  made this assumption in the past and it was the
overwhelming support from  the American people that ultimately gave us the
strength to exact our mission and bring our troops home so soon (your truly
included).

But the Gulf War was neither long or drawn out. A campaign through the
mountains of Persia probably will be long, difficult and ugly. If you
recall this region was the labeled the Russian 'Vietnam'. I think the
perpetrators have already assumed that American, public support will
dissolve quickly for a conflict with TWO fronts. The main front in the
Southwest Asia AND A DOMESTIC front that will feature psychological and
physical violence that American has never had to deal with before. Really
think about that and ask yourself have they calculated correctly? I
personally think they have made a grave error. America may have a broken
nose, but it's arms, legs, and spirit stand ready and waiting.

I offer these opinions to get folks thinking and preparing for what might
happen next. And if it does, we have to examine our reaction and RESOLVE
now. The war that the President says that we are now in will surely last
longer than the hundred day Gulf War. I think it will probably take years
with uncomfortable lulls between attacks and skirmishes.

And a final point. I can definitely understand why Americans would want to
postpone regular activities out of respect for the Americans that lost
their lives. It's a natural, reactive response. What most people don't
understand however is that you do not let terrorist dictate what you do.
When that happens, you living your life by their rules. May I suggest a
proactive response. Return to normal life as closely as you can. That is
the best, immediate, defiant message we can send back to them. The first of
many...um...messages, we will be sending them.
