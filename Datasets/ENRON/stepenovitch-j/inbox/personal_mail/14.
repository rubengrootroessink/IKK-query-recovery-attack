Hey!  The draft date has been set for Wednesday Sept. 5th @ 5:30 @ Dirty's
on Durham/ I-10.  Just some quick points.  This years entry fee is $200
payable to me (for you check writers) on the day of the draft.  Out of the
$200, $5 will go to me for the purchase of the stats and system upkeep and
the other $195 will go into the pot.  So the pot will start out at $2730.00
and should climb over the $3000 mark by the end of the year.  Last year we
had 75 transactions for a total of $375.  I think with the amount of money
involved this year that we might see the transaction total get to 100+.  We
are going to change the scoring system around a little bit.  I am going to
update the system and then I will send out a copy to all of you in the next
day or two.  We will get points for yards gained and not the century mark,
i.e 1 point for every 15 yards rushing or receiving and 1 point for every
50 yards passing.  We will not go to any negative based scoring system.
The vote was pretty much unanimous on that point.  We have one spot still
available.  Let me know if any of you have someone in mind.  I would prefer
that they are able to be at the draft.  We have 5 newcomers this
year.......WELCOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think that you will
find this to be one of the best Fantasy Leagues that you have been in.  Out
of the 6 teams that we lost 4 made the play-offs.  Will this open the door
for the weak teams that stayed around for another beating?  We will see.
Please call me at 713-207-1493 or email me if you have any questions or
concerns.  You will receive more info in a day or two.
Late!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
