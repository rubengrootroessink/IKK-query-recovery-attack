Dear Joe:

	I have attached a proposed final order for your review.  Most of the
language contained within the order is "standard" language with regard to
the rights, powers and duties as well as the visitation schedule under the
Standard Possession Order.  I have also emphasized in bold lettering those
areas in which some discussion is needed to finalize the document.  I
understand that you will be meeting with Mr. Fullenweider this afternoon and
I hope you will have time to review this to discuss those issues with him.

	I have attached the order in both Word and WordPerfect format.  If
you use Word, some of the formatting on the document will be off because I
converted it from WordPerfect, however, the substance should be verbatim.
If you have any problems pulling this up let me know and I will get you a
copy by alternate means.  Thanks.
