Thanks, Joe.  I will check back with you after the 19th.  The resume I sent highlights more of my PR skills and background, but I don't want to limit my opportunities.  I would also be interested in potential marketing and/or marketing communications opps.  Thanks again!!
Elizabeth

Hello Elizabeth,

I would be happy to give your r?sum? to my mother and father.  In fact,  I'm going home this weekend and I will leave a copy for them.  I should tell you they are on a cruise in Europe until the 19th but keep in touch and I will see what I can do.  

-Joe

Hi Joe-
I am Suzette's friend-the one looking for jobs (on the sly of course) in the greater Tampa and/or St. Petersburg area.  She had suggested I send my resume to you for potential contacts at FPL and Bank of America.  

I am currently in the associate program but have a 'unique' concentration.  I was hired into the marketing track and have focused mainly on those areas here at Enron.  Let me know if you have any questions for me-here's a recent copy of my resume which includes my latest rotation.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,
Beth Peters
