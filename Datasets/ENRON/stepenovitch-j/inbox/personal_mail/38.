Dear Joe:

	Pursuant to our conversation of today's date, you have cancelled a
scheduled appointment which was intended for the preparation of Wednesday's
hearing on Tonya's Special Appearance and Plea to the Jurisdiction.  Your
preparation for this hearing is absolutely critical for any chance of
retaining your case in Texas.  You further indicated that you would not
reschedule the appointment for anytime prior to the hearing and gave me no
indication of your intentions.

	You and your mother have both expressed displeasure in your
representation in this case.  It is apparent to me that this is no longer a
productive working relationship.  Our inability to communicate in a
productive manner and your refusal to participate in the preparation of your
case lead me to only one conclusion.  I must withdraw from your
representation in this matter.

	I will be forwarding to you this afternoon a Motion to Withdraw as
your counsel of record.  It is my intention to present the motion to the
trial Court prior to the hearing on July 18, 2001.
