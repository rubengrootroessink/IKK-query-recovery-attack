Joe,

How are you?  I watched those prices swinging around last week in the east.
I wanted to get involved.

ENE is getting hammered today.  I guess investors do not know about you yet.

I talked to Pete Hanson the other day - he seems to be doing well and as

Jim F is the man at broadband.

Hope you are enjoying the summer.

Tim
