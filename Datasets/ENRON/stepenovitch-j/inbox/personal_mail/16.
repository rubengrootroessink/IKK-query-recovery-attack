Hi Joe -
This is Marcy. Tim forwarded your email to me at home. WOW! We had not heard

the news but are very happy you let us know! How's fatherhood?? Sounds like
you have your hands full traveling back to Orlando every 2 weeks, but it's
well worth it. We wish you the best of luck and would love to see a picture
of Payton if you have one to spare. Our address is 133 Cherry Hill Road,
Greenwich, CT 06831.

Keep in touch and let us know how you and Payton are doing!

Fondly, Marcy Hanna

Thanks for the info...

I have something to tell you that will blow you away?  I can't believe
Serge didn't tell you...  I should have called and told you myself but I've
been so busy and this is why?

I'm a father....

Yes..Can you believe that?  My son (Payton L. Stepenovitch) was born May
12, 2000!  Did I tell you I got engaged to that girl I was dating in
Orlando?  Well we are separated now and she is back in Florida with my son!
I miss him so much but I go home every 2 weeks she wants to be close to her
family as well as mine.  I don't know if things will workout with her and I
but we have the most beautiful son in the world.  I'll send you some
pictures...what is your address?

Are you blown away?

Me too...

anyway give Marcy my best and I'll call you this weekend...

-Joe Step (no Mr...that's dad)

     Mr Step,

     James worked at Statoil and then at SETC for over a year.

     He never directly worked for me.  The impression I got was the was that
     he
     was organized and has a good understanding of energy transmission,
     losses,
     etc.  He helped the East goup with NEISO/NYISO for about a month and
     then
     was a day person and then 24 hour peron working for Missy Ellis trying
     to do
     real time business in the Midcon. (no comment by me on this SETC email)

     I do not think he ever has experienced real "trading" where he is
     actively
     buying and selling.  I am sure he could learn "trading" if put in the
     that
     environment.

     Marcy is doing great - buying lots of things for the house!

     How is your life outside of ENE?  Any new serious gf?

     My friend Rudy Stoett (Jim F knows him) is moving to Houston this
     weekend to
     work for Texaco.

     Let me know if you want to talk more about Mr Vasquez.

     Have a good weekend,

     Tim
