Dear Joseph Stepenovitch,

Thank you for your gift of $250.00 to The September 11th Telethon Fund. The Fund was established to collect and distribute contributions to the 'Tribute to Heroes' telethon, organized by the entertainment industry in response to the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

The September 11th Fund has been providing emergency grants to expert relief agencies directly serving immediate needs of victims and their families. Right now, your contribution to the Telethon fund is helping to provide emergency cash assistance to victims and their families.  Your gift will also help to support the full range of support that victims and family members need to rebuild their lives.

On behalf of Joshua Gotbaum, executive director and chief executive officer of The September 11th Fund, we invite you to visit http://www.september11fund.org for up-to-date information and to sign up for e-mail updates on how your gift is helping victims and their families.

If your employer has a matching gift program for The September 11th Fund and requires verification of your gift, this letter will serve as that verification.  Please contact your company's human resource or community affairs department if you have any questions.

Again, thank you for allowing us the opportunity to serve those in need during this time of crisis.

Sincerely,


Ralph Dickerson, Jr.
President
United Way of New York City

P.S. We will mail you a paper receipt for your tax records shortly.
