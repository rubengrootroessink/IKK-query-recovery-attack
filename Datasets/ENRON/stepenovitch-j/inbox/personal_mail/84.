Dear Hewitt Financial Services via CSFBdirect Client,

On November 28, 2001 CSFBdirect's parent company, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), and Bank of Montreal (TSE, NYSE: BMO) announced their agreement for the Bank of Montreal, parent company of Harris Bank, to acquire CSFBdirect.

Bank of Montreal, one of the largest banks in North America, is a highly diversified financial services institution. The bank operates more than 30 lines of business within the Bank of Montreal Group of Companies, including Chicago based Harris Bank, a major U.S. mid-west financial services provider, and Harris InvestorLine, the Bank's direct investing affiliate in the U.S.  Harris InvestorLine has a 35-year history of servicing direct investing clients, and 17 retail branch locations across the country.

Hewitt Financial Services remains committed to providing you with the highest quality service and support. If any changes to the Hewitt Financial Services program arise as a result of this transaction, we will communicate those to you promptly. As ever, if you have any questions concerning your Hewitt Financial Services account, you may call an Investor Services Representative at 1.800.890.3200, or send an e-mail to hewitt@csfbdirect.com.

Thank you for your continued business.

Sincerely,
