Dear Miryam:
 
In response to your letter to Donn  Fullenweider dated July 27, 2001, Page 2, Paragraph 2, Mr. Fullenweider advises  that he was simply requesting a copy of the birth certificate.  Thank you  for your explanation that it will take several weeks to get one.  Once it  has been received, we would appreciate receiving a copy.
 
Thank you!
