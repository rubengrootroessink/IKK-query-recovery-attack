Hey Joe.

Enron is a great company.  I need you working hard for me!  Our interests
are aligned.

Have a good trip to Fla.  I hope your boy is doing well.

It is the same here.  Everyone looking out for themselves.  (and the copier
still breaks down making the morning packet.)

Cliff wants to know if you can make it to the bowling the first weekend in
Dec.

Tim

Good Morning Tim,

Well, I guess you and Bill were right!  About Enron...

You should see this place everyone is so down.  What do you think about
our situation?  I'm not sure what to make of it.  People are starting to
leave.

Anyway, I'm going home again tomorrow.  This going home every two weeks
is starting to take its toll but I have to do it.  We are not getting
along so it makes this worse.
Well I hope thinks are going good for you.  Please tell everyone I said
hello.

-Joe Step
