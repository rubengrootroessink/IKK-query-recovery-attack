Per our conversation today you wanted to know what  I propose, there are only a few things. I would like us to follow the law as closely as  possible:
 
    1)    I  want per Texas law you to pay what your requested in child support, so  in the future there will be no discrepency.  Paid                 through the Clerk of  Court in Harris County.  
    2)    I  would like to follow the visitation guidelines that Miram provided to me.   I am willing to work with you to make it more                       convenient (with  Payton's best interest in mind).
    3)     I still  propose that you pay my attorney fees.  During your Orlando visit on July  28th with Payton you  stated, 
            "You wanted to do whatever you needed to do to make me happy because then you  knew Payton would be  happy."                      This would make me  happy and it would help me to provide for Payton the best I  can.
    4)    I am  willing to cooperate with your family in scheduling visits within reason with  Payton.
    5)    In  Orlando on July 29th you asked if I could bring Payton to New Orleans for your  Uncles wedding..I told you would think                  about it.   After careful consideration I feel that at Payton's age that will not be a wise  decision.
 
These are the issues that I can think of right  now.  Once you provide me with a proposal I will let you know  if anything else comes to mind.  I feel by both parties following the  Texas law it will work in everyones best interest.
