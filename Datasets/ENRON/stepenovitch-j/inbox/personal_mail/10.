Hey!  Thanks for showing up last night.  I am going to update the
divisions, rosters and schedules today.  Everything should be ready to go
this afternoon.  Just for back-up please email me your starting lineup for
week one.  Any problems getting into the system please feel free to call me
@ 713-207-1493.  Here are the pay-outs for the season:

     $10 per week for high scoring team for that week ( total pay-out for
year = $130 )

     $65 to high scoring team for season from your weekly starters ( total
pay-out for year = $65 )

     $35 to top scoring QB for the season, points only count for games
started

     67% of remaining pot to 1st place
     33% of remaining pot to 2nd place

Here is the breakdown:

       $200 x 14 owners =  $2800
          less system fee =      $75
     less incentive pay =    $520
              remaining pot = $2205

     1st place winner @ 67% = $1477.35
     2nd place winner @ 33% = $727.65

Any questions drop me an email or call me.  Also your lineups are do before
kick-off of the first game of that week.  So more times than not your
line-ups are due Sunday before kickoff.  It is nice to have them in there
by Friday afternoon so that people can print out the lineups to take home
with them.  So when there is a Thursday night game your lineup for that
week including Sunday's games are due Thursday night before kick-off.
Thanks again for playing.  May the best owner win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good luck.  Later Brian  Oh!  make sure that once I have updated everyone's
rosters that I gave you the right players.  Sometimes I will get mixed up
on the Smith's, Johnson's etc....
