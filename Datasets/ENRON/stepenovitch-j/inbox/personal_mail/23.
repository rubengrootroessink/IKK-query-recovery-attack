Joe,
I recieved your e-mail, I will read it over and give a response to it
tomorrow.

This is what I propose to you regarding payment for the nine months:

Since you did not incur any medical expenses, knowing what they could of
been I would like;

Attorney fees both Florida & Texas        $9500.00
(not including Texas fees for 8/1 and forward to finalize our case)
Back child support for 2 1/2 months        $2500.00
Half of what expenses I incurred getting ready for Payton (crib, swing,
stroller, car seat etc., etc.,)    $1500.00

I know that incurredmore expenses than this (going back & forth to doctor,
lost wages at work, etc.)

Please let me know whst your thoughts are.

Tonya

Tonya,

Please read this standard possession order.  This will only be used if
we don't agree to our own terms.

I'll call you tomorrow when I get the other forms.

Have a wonderful night and tell my son I love him and I miss him with
all of my heart (please give him a kiss for me!)

-Joe
