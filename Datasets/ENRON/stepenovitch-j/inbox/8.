son , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tam=
pa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee b=
ruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore =
right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in the=
 morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying that=
 it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not hav=
e played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith , =
RB DAL! -! Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite =
having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over A=
rizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all r=
ight," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree=
 the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off the=
 field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New =
York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, b=
ut said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepp=
er , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpep=
per suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not ex=
pected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updat=
ed 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and =
did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical=
 silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - O=
per Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries =
against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Bronco=
s let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appear=
s to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a=
 TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he rema=
ins one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updat=
ed 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He al=
so carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play =
threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curti=
s Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes fo=
r 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but n=
ow he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is final=
ly performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE =
SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle to play=
 against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catche=
s was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on =
short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight e=
nd when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G =
money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four=
 catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to =
their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers=
 ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free Ag! en! t Updated 10/28/01 Pri=
ce caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is =
still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy=
 teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/28/0=
1 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs an=
d no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key p=
asses and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander ,=
 RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 2=
3 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final=
 numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will=
 continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses mi=
ght limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10=
/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 =
wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backu=
p.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught e=
ight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The M=
iami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Day=
ne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards o=
n eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbe=
rs, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , =
WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yard=
s and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no m=
a! tt! er what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Upda=
ted 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held ou=
t of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Reds=
kins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  T=
ony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards,=
 two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB i=
s playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PH=
I - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but wa=
s held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 3=
5 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should =
post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Bu=
ckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither bac=
k is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie =
Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for=
 77 yards and a touch! do! wn Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put=
 him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley re=
mains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Gannon pas=
sed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game=
 at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, =
and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan M=
cNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 =
yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercept=
ed either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raid=
ers' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a =
slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quar=
terback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCW=
D's Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Da=
llas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don'=
t think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder o=
f the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught =
nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer ha=
s been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has p=
roven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona pass=
ing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , Q=
B ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchd=
owns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting h=
ow inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shoul=
dn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - B=
eegs Boys Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points S=
unday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' de=
fense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matc=
hup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit =
will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB D=
AL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 y=
ards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 2=
3 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren=
't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' sec=
ondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Em=
mitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game =
against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after a=
ccumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  =
Rob Johnson , QB BUF - God Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in t=
he third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker r=
oom for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt befor=
