 game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter,=

23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to=
 play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/23/0=

 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thu=

TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01  Walls was able to play in Sunday's game desp=
ite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining h=

a injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on=
 a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd B=
ouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probab=
le for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but h=
e may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent =
Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because o=
f the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. =
If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turn=
er will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing =
their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.=
   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a ca=
reer-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best r=
unners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve=
 McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despi=
te suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdow=
n pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia =
, QB SF - God Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all =
week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a crack=
ed rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his t=
hrows. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he w=
ill still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Upd=
ated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an an=
kle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but retur=
ned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Gadsde=
n did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstri=
ng injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - F=
ree Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably b=
e sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurric=
anes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy r=
eceiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season=
.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith =
hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during =
the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01=
 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in p=
lace of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help F=
antasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Pe=
rrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy=
 playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he=
 is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hur=
ricanes Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success =
during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Ric=
h Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fa=
ntasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should=
 never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 12/21/01 Moss star=
ted off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. =
Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC=
 - R-Diddy Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners =
this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Mi=
chael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inco=
nsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best d=
uring your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Ga=
rdner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper l=
eague, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free =
Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat t=
his year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE K=
C - Beegs Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected =
this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. =
  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of th=
e best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glor=
y.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an incons=
istent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the sea=
son.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had =
a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your pos=
tseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck=
 has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy =
