Dear Joe,

I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back meetings,
hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a short
telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition schedule
may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge rules at a
hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court, I
could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery responses
because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

Jonda

Good Morning Jonda,

I would like to met with Mr. Fullenweider today if that is possible?  I'm
going out of town Thursday thru Sunday of this week.  I think it is very
important that I speak with him as soon as possible.  Please let me know if
today is good for him.  Thanks again,

-Joe

   Dear Joe,

   Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00
   p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could
   come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's
   soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for you???
