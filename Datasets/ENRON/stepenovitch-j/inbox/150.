his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn=

FC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TE=
N - Beegs Boys Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering fr=
om back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the s=

 Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He play=

yoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step=
 back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin =
Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams mu=
ch during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Upd=

 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the play=
offs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB O=
AK - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this y=

to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Upda=

eason as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your play=
offs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been =
very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting=
 Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 1=
