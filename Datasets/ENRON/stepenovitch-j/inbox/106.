Thanks for the insight.  Hopefully, we will be able to set something up.

I didn't really think FPL was going to have something, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I am now trying to find someone I can network with or through at Progress Energy, formerly Florida Power.  Don't have a cousin there do ya??  Just kidding...

But seriously, when your schedule allows, I would love to buy you a drink as a thank you.  You have been great.

It will go along way with her..trust me (she'll think your making an effort)  As for FPL, I don't think they have much of an operation in the Tampa area.  The corp office is in Juno Beach.

Dear you-
I will give her a call tomorrow.  My boss is leaving earlier than me on Thursday, so maybe I could meet with her then.  Thanks for the suggestion.
Beth

I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,
Beth

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.
Beth

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.
