  Dear Joe Stepo,  Here is the latest NFL News from the Associated Press:  =
RAIDERS Oakland kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a nightclub due to "an =
apparent drug overdose," cutting his face and requiring five stitches a few=
 hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police said Tuesday.  Janiko=
wski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar reported he=
 had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne Tully said.  =
Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested, =
Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that=
 Janikowski was "possibly overdosing on GHB" _ the so-called date-rape drug=
.  Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug =
possession and evidence tampering in April in Florida after being accused o=
f possessing GHB.  In the police report Monday, officers wrote they "found =
Janikowski incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result =
of the uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caus=
ed a cut over his right eye."  Janikowski did not respond when officers tal=
ked to him, and he was placed in soft restraints on a gurney for the trip t=
o the hospital, the police report said.  Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman=
, told police the kicker was not taking drugs but that he was with an unide=
ntified woman earlier in the night who may have slipped something into his =
drink.  Other witnesses told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily taking =
what appeared to be GHB and that he "does it all the time."  Paul Healy, th=
e kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head wound. He said=
 his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug overdose were "to=
tally false."  "I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and=
 slipped and fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and =
he slipped and whacked his head," Healy said. "You don't have a drug overdo=
se Sunday night and go to practice Monday morning."  Raiders coaches said J=
anikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has made all eight of his f=
ield goals this season, was not in the locker room in the hour that reporte=
rs are allowed access on days following games.  Janikowski, a native of Pol=
and, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000 draft after starring at F=
lorida State.  In June 2000, Janikowski was acquited on a charge he offered=
 a Tallahassee policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument wit=
h a bouncer who wouldn't let him into a local nightclub.  His contract incl=
udes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000 for every game =
he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of his run-ins wi=
th the law.  CHIEFS Starters Derrick Alexander, Tony Richardson and Dante H=
all will probably be out Sunday when Kansas City plays host to Pittsburgh. =
 The loss of Alexander, last year's team MVP and the Chiefs' only experienc=
ed wide receiver, will send the Chiefs (1-3) into the weekend dangerously s=
hort at the position.  Sylvester Morris, last year's No. 1 draft pick, has =
been out all year with a knee injury. Marvin "Snoop" Minnis, this year's to=
p pick, has been inconsistent.  Inconsistency at wide receiver has been cit=
ed by coach Dick Vermeil as the top reason for quarterback Trent Green's pr=
oblems. Green threw four interceptions last week in Denver.  "It really mak=
es us thin at wide receiver," said Vermeil. "We count on Hall as one of our=
 four wide receivers, but now we can't do that."  Alexander, slowed all sea=
son with a sore Achilles' tendon, developed back spasms during pregame warm=
ups last week before the Chiefs' loss at Denver. Although Alexander played,=
 Vermeil said he "couldn't bend over and tie his shoelaces" on Monday.  Ful=
lback Richardson, the Chiefs' most consistent performer on offense, also mi=
ssed last week's game with a shoulder injury. Hall, a wide receiver/kick re=
turner, has a "deep contusion" on a shoulder that has already undergone sur=
gery.  "It would take drastic change to all of a sudden have Tony Richardso=
n back," Vermeil said. "I think it's a better chance of having him a week f=
rom this weekend."  The only healthy wide receivers left are Minnis, Chris =
Thomas and Larry Parker. Tight end Mikhael Ricks will probably be used in t=
he position.  The Chiefs will be reduced to using defensive backs as wide r=
eceivers during practice. But Vermeil said he did not anticipate bringing i=
n another wide receiver.  "The problem with bringing guys in is you have to=
 let somebody else go. Who? If guys are injured and go on injured reserve, =
they create their own roster vacancy," Vermeil said. "But who do you want t=
o sacrifice? It's not an easy thing to do.  "Then if you do bring somebody =
in, will he suit up on Sunday? When you bring them on the roster and he can=
't automatically line up and play this weekend because he doesn't know the =
scheme, that really hurts you."  One possibility would be Derrick Mayes. Si=
gned to a free-agent contract last spring, the former Seattle starter was r=
eleased after training camp.  "We've talked to Mayes in the past about bein=
g in shape and being available," Vermeil said. "He would be a logical guy b=
ecause of his knowledge of our scheme. But who would we let go?"  Vermeil s=
aid Parker would probably return punts, but rookie running back Derrick Bla=
ylock could be activated. Reserve running back Mike Cloud was expected to r=
eturn kickoffs.  Richardson's loss is felt throughout the offense.  "Tony R=
ichardson might be the best player at his position in the league," Vermeil =
said. "We miss his leadership. We miss his running. We miss his blocking. I=
t's not easy to just plug somebody in."  COWBOYS Rookie quarterback Quincy =
Carter is expected to be out two weeks for the Dallas Cowboys after straini=
ng his left hamstring in the loss against Oakland.  Anthony Wright, who rep=
laced Carter in the first quarter, is set to face Washington in his third s=
tart of the season.  Carter had a MRI on Monday to determine the injury's s=
everity.  "My teammates know I can play," he told The Dallas Morning News o=
n Tuesday. "They know I have talent. I've just had some injury problems."  =
Carter had returned to the lineup on Sunday after missing two games with a =
bruised thumb.  During an 8-yard run in the 28-21 loss to Oakland, Carter s=
trained his hamstring. He finished the drive but did not return.  On his fi=
rst play, Wright threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway, who ran p=
ast Pro Bowl cornerback Charles Woodson.  "Anthony showed us that he can co=
me off the bench and play with a limited number of repetitions in practice,=
" coach Dave Campo said.  Wright completed 14 of 22 passes for 126 yards wi=
th two touchdowns and no interceptions. He has been the quarterback when Da=
llas scored 44 of its 66 points this season. =09
