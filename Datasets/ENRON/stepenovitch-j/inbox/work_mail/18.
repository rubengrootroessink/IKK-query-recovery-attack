Guys:

Here are the banner ads.  I'm not sure I'm totally sold on them, however, it is important we get the ads going.  Personally, I think they are a little to alike and EnronOnline is too small.  Also, on the last banner, should we promote the Bal of Day instead of Bal of Mo. ?  If you want, I'll step up to the desk and we can discuss.

Thanks for you patience and input.  
T.

Teresa -- Could you review these 7 ads with the Power desk and I can get them placed on PJM's web site.  I am happy with them and legal is as well.  We even added some animation.
