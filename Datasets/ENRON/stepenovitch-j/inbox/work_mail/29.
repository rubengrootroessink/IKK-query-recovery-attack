( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Kinder Morgan Plans 5,500MW of New Power
Generation, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 30, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.:
Houston, Texas). Kinder Morgan Power Company, a subsidiary of Kinder
Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI) (Houston, Texas), is quickly emerging as a
powerful force in the race to power America. The company's power
development program calls for the construction of ten natural
gas-fired generation plants that represent approximately 5,500
mega-watts (MW) of intermediate power. Williams Energy Services will
provide fuel to the plants and marketing of the new generation
capacity. The first two plants will begin generating in the summer of
2002, with the remaining plants in commercial operation by 2005.
	   The company has secured agreements with General Electric (GE) and
Deltac to provide turbines and heat recovery steam generators
respectively, for all the plants. Research by Industrialinfo.com
outlines each of the ten projects being engineered, under construction
and in the startup phase.
	   Kinder Morgan was founded in 1936 and began developing natural
gas-fired power generation plants in 1998. KMI is one of the largest
mid-stream energy companies in America, operating more than 30,000
miles of natural gas and product pipelines across the United States.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Power and Energy markets as well as other industrial
