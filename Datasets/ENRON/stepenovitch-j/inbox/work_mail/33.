Leslie,

Joe Stepenovitch wants to add Saturday & Sunday to his EPT balance of day products.  Please let me know if we can go ahead and make the changes to the load shapes.  He is doing this so that he can trade during the weekend as well. Please let me and Chris know what you think.

Thanks,
Melba Lozano
