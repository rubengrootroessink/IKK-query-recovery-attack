Thanks for the invite to vegas in october, but I'm not going to be able to make
it. Frank Zingone is one of our hourly traders who is very active in both
real-time and day ahead northeast and would like him to take my place if thats
ok. Sound like I'm going to miss a good time, we'll have to hook up some other
time.

I noticed the PJM next day and bal week swaps haven't been on the menu lately,
someone on vacation? Too bad if not, I don't like dealing with the hassle of
the physical scheduling and reserve charges to PJM. I'm trying to get the
trading floor involved with more swaps and less physicals for those reasons.
just curious.

thanks again, let me know if Frank can schedule the trip.


later
