Attached are the final banner ads ...let me know if you disapprove of any.  Kal thinks they will hit the PJM site late next week.

Teresa -- Here are the ads.  PJM has to get them approved through their legal and PR depts. and then their technical team has to get them online.  They should go on the site by end of next week.
