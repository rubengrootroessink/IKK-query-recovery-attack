Peter,

The bridging/testing process was completed yesterday afternoon.  I am meeting with Mark Taylor in legal today to discuss the description.  I do not think there will be any issues and should have it ready by tomorrow or possibly late this afternoon.  Also, besides yourself, who will be trading this index?

Thanks,

CW

Chris,
Just touching base with you to see the status of the PJM Day ahead product.  We are anxious to get it out online.

Can you create an on-peak and off peak product.

thank you,
