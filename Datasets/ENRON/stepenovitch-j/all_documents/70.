It is like watching paint dry this afternoon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Santa was good to me though I have been bad this year ...  
I won't be there through New Years ...I get back Saturday evening.  I'm going 
with Jeri...remember her, she is my friend who met us at Keneally's ?   I 
would love to stay...and might, you never know !!  Jeri has to get back 
before New Years Eve ...her husband would come looking for us :)
I'm sure you could find plenty of trouble to get into in MIAMI...one can only 
imagine !!!  
Miss you ?!?!?!  Well of course ...what woman wouldn't !!!!!!!!!!
There is a guy on a Tommy H. commercial who looks somewhat like you ...have 
you taken a job on the side !?

Joseph,

I am in ...that is until Thursday around 4:00...then I'm heading to Atlanta 
to the Peach Bowl !!
I started to call you Christmas Day to check on you...then thought it might 
make you cry, you know, it being Christmas and all  ....
What are you going to do at home on New Years ?!?!
I don't even know what I'm going to do ...but, not very concerned ...I think 
New Years is overrated...it is a night where there is big pressure to "have a 
blast" !!
