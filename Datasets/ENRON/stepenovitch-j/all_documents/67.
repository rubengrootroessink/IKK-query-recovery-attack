Joseph,

I am in ...that is until Thursday around 4:00...then I'm heading to Atlanta 
to the Peach Bowl !!
I started to call you Christmas Day to check on you...then thought it might 
make you cry, you know, it being Christmas and all  ....
What are you going to do at home on New Years ?!?!
I don't even know what I'm going to do ...but, not very concerned ...I think 
New Years is overrated...it is a night where there is big pressure to "have a 
blast" !!
