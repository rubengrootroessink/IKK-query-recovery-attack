 Good Morning "Me",

Sounds like a movie scene from Mrs. Robinson !!  (I'll explain this evening 
if you're not familar with the movie)
 Don't tell me ...I'll wait.
Where I'm involved ...it is always safety in numbers :)  
See you this evening ...and I think I need to get a head start !

Good Morning T-

I must be doing something right if I can't make you sleep at night......  
I'll give you a hint:  You would think I copied this out of movie script....  
(a guy, a girl and a church)  Your a smart woman, so I'm sure you can figure 
it out!!!!  

Anyway, 6:00 or 6:15 would be better for me, but your welcome to get a head 
start!  You can bring your friend if you want (is it safety in number or are 
you playing a zone?)   Well have a good day and I'll see you tonight..

Sure we're still on for tomorrow .... I can't sleep @ night wondering what 
happened to you !!!  How does 5:45ish sound ?  Is that too early or too late 
(I'm flexible) ?!
I thought about inviting Beth, my co-worker, who you met at PowerMart, but if 
this story is of a private nature I won't extend the invitation...just let me 
know.
Glad you're feeling better...that's a relief  :)
My day went well... I'm very busy this week  (keeps me out of trouble !) 
...thanks for asking.
