Sure we're still on for tomorrow .... I can't sleep @ night wondering what 
happened to you !!!  How does 5:45ish sound ?  Is that too early or too late 
(I'm flexible) ?!
I thought about inviting Beth, my co-worker, who you met at PowerMart, but if 
this story is of a private nature I won't extend the invitation...just let me 
know.
Glad you're feeling better...that's a relief  :)
My day went well... I'm very busy this week  (keeps me out of trouble !) 
...thanks for asking.
