Hello Joseph ("Me"),

I went to the party...it was nice, as they always are, lots of very low cut 
dresses and people politicking ...not my first choice of how I like to spend 
my Saturday nights !!   Are you going to the ENA party ?  I am not surprised 
you slept most of the weekend ...you were exhausted on Friday...I could 
barely get a smile out of you :<)
I was prepared to play "crisis hotline" this weekend....I thought at some 
point you might start feeling out of sorts and need to talk.  I'm curious how 
much of last Wednesday nights conversation you remember....hummmmm  !?!?
I'm heading to Vegas Wednesday ...returning Friday evening ...decided  it 
wasn't a good idea for Jay to meet me out there...severing the ties is 
tough...don't you agree ?!?!
Melba, who is in production, is out today...with hope, she will return 
tomorrow and we can set something up tomorrow afternnoon  ...that's what I'm 
shooting for, if she doesn't return, I'll leave a message for her to set 
something up with you.

Have a nice afternoon ...glad you caught up on your sleep !

Joseph,

I think we e-mailed each other right at the same time this morning....that's 
scary !!!  Glad you're alive !
My plans: I might meet a couple of Coral traders early (4:30ish), but they 
are hung over from a dinner last night ...ooops...I'd invite you to join us, 
but I imagine you're heading straight  home to bed this evening .   Tomorrow 
my new dinning room suit is getting delivered (yeepie  !),  Enron Net Works 
party Saturday night (I think my date, Jay, has forgotten...isn't that swell 
?!) and Sunday ....relax :)

T.

Good Morning,

Well I'm alive....  How are you feeling today?  I need to get some sleep!!!!  
I'm so tired...  What are your plans for the weekend?  I have no plans as of 
yet..

Rudy is out of town but I can speek for both of us.  I'm good like that...  
We are ready but I think we should all sit down together again.  I have some 
different ideas.  Now that I'm on days, it will be easier to set up this 
meeting. Let me know when there ready to meet.  Gotta run... I'll e-mail you 
later.  Have a good day!

Good Afternoon Gentlemen:

The production group would like to know if you're ready to take hourly 
on-line ?!  The testing as gone well and the only thing on this side left to 
do is load up production database.  I understand this is very time consuming, 
therefore, they would like to have a better idea of your time frame and if 
you're interested in all hubs discussed earlier.

By the way, thanks so much for last night ....you guys were loads of fun !

T.
