Subject: Golf Association 2001 start next month!

Hello all, and welcome to the Enron Golf Association and the 2001 season.  We 
are looking forward to a great year with a great schedule and we need someone 
to stop Richard Hanagriff from winning player of the year.  Go to the website 
@ http://home.enron.com:84/egc/index.htm under Admin services and fill out a 
member form and send it to Molly Carriere.  This year Enron has decide to 
cut  all the association budgets in half so we have selected some more 
inexpensive courses and raised some green fees to help meet a budget.  The 
joining fee remains @ $30.

Our first tournament is on Saturday, March 3 @ High Meadows Ranch.  This is a 
great new "must play" course.  We are only charging $55 to play which is a 
great deal.  Please send Larry Robinson a check for $85 ($55 + $30) and sign 
up as soon as you can.  This is a best ball tournament and tees off @ 8:00 am.

Our next course is March 24 at the Kingwood "Forest" Course so we are 
starting out strong.  

Have fun and make birdies!

Gary Lamphier
