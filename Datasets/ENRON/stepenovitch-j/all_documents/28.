didn't extend the invitation to our group !

 Hello Joseph,

 You are correct about who is the coolest ....it is you hands down !!  I like 
it when there is an e-mail from you when I arrive in the morning  :<)   I'm 
waiting for the next big shock from you ....though your last story will be 
hard to top ...it was worth the wait, beer, xoxxo, and hang over !!  
Maybe I'll have to buy the beer next week when I get back from Vegas ...I 
might have a good story ....hummmm........of course, you have the ENA party 
...you might have some tales to tell ....
I still want to know how much of last Wednesday you remember ?!?!?!??!  Don't 
keep me in supense until tomorrow ....write back soon !
