Dear valued E*TRADE customer,

As a valued customer of E*TRADE, you have been selected to
participate in a customer satisfaction program, with the opportunity to give
E*TRADE your input and help them enhance the services you use with your
online trading.

Your participation is very important as E*TRADE is committed
to providing you with the best possible service.

With the help of Walker Information, a specifically designed
web-based research tool has been created to measure your opinions and
feelings about the products and services that E*TRADE provides to you. A
clear understanding of your needs will enable E*TRADE to identify areas
where they can better serve you.

The survey is detailed and may take as long as 20 to 30
minutes to finish.  Please choose a time that is convenient for you to
complete the survey in one sitting. If this is not possible, you can leave
the survey site and return at a more convenient time.

As a token of our appreciation, we will send you an E*TRADE
T-shirt upon completion of the survey. The survey site will close on
Tuesday, January 23rd, at  midnight EST. If you would like to participate
in the survey and receive a t-shirt, please be sure to complete your survey
by this time.

Below is a hyperlink to the website where you will find the
survey. Again, we would encourage you to complete the survey at a convenient
time and in one sitting.

In advance, thank you very much for your time and we greatly
appreciate your willingness to participate!

(Note: The web survey will run more efficiently when you do
not have other applications open during the time you are completing it.)
