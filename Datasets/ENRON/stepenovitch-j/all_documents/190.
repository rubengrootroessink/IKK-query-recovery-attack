Hello GOD-

Do you really call yourself God?  That is pitiful-not surprising though.  
Okay, I have taken care of Mike at AES.  They should be able to transact on 
US East Pwr Fin by tomorrow afternoon.  Credit will open them up tonight.  I 
left my number with him, but let me know if he calls you with any other 
problems.

My Easter was great-I had way too much to eat.  I am feeling a little large 
today.  I can't believe you had to work on Easter...I probably ate enough for 
both of us.  Who needs Megawatt.  Everyone knows that God does everything 
first.  Don't blame it on us Power Girls, we rock the house...

In case you don't recognize my name- I am Adriane Moratto, but just changed 
my name after the wedding.  Just wanted to catch up with you and see how 
things were going with the new product.  Seems to be a success.  Let me know 
if you have any other guys you want me to call or if there is anything else I 
can do to get you some more players.
