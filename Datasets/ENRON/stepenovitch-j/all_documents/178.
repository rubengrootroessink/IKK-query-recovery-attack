> Please meet me at the elevators beside the Union Station Ruggles.   As you
> enter Union Station, the Astros store will be to the right and Ruggles is
> to the left.   To the left of Ruggles is a set of elevators that will take
> us to the roof for food, drinks and great camaraderie!   I will be sitting
> by the elevators with your nametag, badge and ticket.   These were not
> handed out early just in case there were last-minute cancellations that
> someone else could step into the spot.
