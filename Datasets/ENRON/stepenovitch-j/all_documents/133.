Hey baby,

Thanks for the message on my cell today.  I was at the gym when I got it and
it instantly put a smile on my face.  So how was your day?  Mine was ok,
kinda hectic though.  I felt like I was rushing all over town all day.  By
the way my hair looks awsome, too bad you can't see it.  Well I kinda missed
hearing from you today, I mean atleast getting an e-mail from you.  I'm sure
you were busy working so its ok.  I mean atleast someone was working today.
So are we really going to the Kentucky Derby in May?  I really think it'll be
fun.  Plus it would be like old times seeing you again.  Hopefully we'll get
together much sooner than that.  Oh, i'm really sorry but I haven't
remembered the name of that movie yet!!!!  Won't you tell me it so you can
put me out of my misery.  Pretty Please!!!!!!!  Anyways, I do remember other
things though.  Like, meeting you for lunch at the Black Tulip and how cute
you always looked in you suits.  Plus there is always the first time we met
at the new years eve party.  You know when you put your class ring on my
finger and asked me to have your kids.  I bet you didn't remember that one,
now did you?  Well honey I guess i'm gonna get off here and go to bed.  I'm
really not looking forward to tomorrow but just maybe some secret admirer
will send me flowers or something.  Well i'm not counting on it but you never
know.  Have a great day tomorrow and i'll talk to you soon

smooches
trina

ps... miss you
