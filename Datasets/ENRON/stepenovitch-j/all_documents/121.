Narsimha,

Have a look at this.  Have we been using the correct rates?

"Manley, Matt" <matt.manley@neg.pge.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE
Discussion List:

The TSC rates posted on the Oasis site "Effective Feb 1, 2001" do not match
the TSC rates computed by the TSC Calculator under "Services" and Market
Data Toolbox.  In some cases the rates are off by $2 or more (especially the
newly posted rates effective since Dec 2000).  I noticed that there are 6
new postings from Jan 16 through Jan 18 for TSCs (effective September 2000
through Feb 2001).  Prior to the postings on Jan 16 through Jan 18, the
posted TSC rates had not been updated since July 27, 2000.

Please do not tell me that we can expect several rebills from transmission
providers for each of the months Sept 2000 through Feb 2001 and that the TSC
rate was posted inaccurately for the past 7 months.  Am I reading this
incorrectly.  The TSC rates are a very important rate for market
transparency and greatly factor into whether or not deals are set up.

These prices need to be accurately portrayed prior to the start of the
month.

Is the TSC calculator correct or are the TSC rates posted under "OASIS"
correct?  Check out the TSC rates between NY and external pools on the TSC
calculator and the prices posted on the OASIS.

Which are correct?
