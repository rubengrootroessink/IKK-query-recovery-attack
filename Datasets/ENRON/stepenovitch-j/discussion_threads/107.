Guilt trips aren't nice.  Things have been a little hectic around here and 
one of my best friends had surgery so I was back and forth to the hospital.  
(All is well).  How are things going for you?  Are you guys going out tonight?

Also hope that you have a wonderful weekend, but I actually mean it.
