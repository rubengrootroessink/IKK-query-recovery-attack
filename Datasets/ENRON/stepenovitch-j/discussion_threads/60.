As many of you know, we recently changed Internet Account Access providers 
and have had problems with the service including slow access, or no access at 
times. We realize many of you depend on QuickLink to handle your transactions 
daily and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

It appears the problems are related to the interface between our home banking 
provider and our host processor. We assure you that we are on top of the 
situation and are working diligently to see that the New QuickLink is fully 
operational as soon as possible.

Although we are working to resolve this issue quickly, we want you to be able 
to take care of any financial transactions right away if needed. Here are a 
couple of other options:

1) Call QuickTeller, our free Automated Phone Service, which is available 
24-hours a day. QuickTeller allows you to make transfers, verify cleared 
checks and posted deposits, check account history and more. QuickTeller can 
be accessed at 713-853-1466, or 800-321-1396.  If you need your QuickTeller 
P.I.N., please contact us at 713-853-6242, or 800-241-5871.

2) Call us at 713-853-6242, or 800-241-5871, and we will be glad to provide 
account information over the phone.

3) Or, send your transaction request to us via E-mail from either our 
Intranet Site, or Internet Site at efcu@enron.com.

We appreciate your understanding and patience, and assure you QuickLink will 
be fully operational as soon as possible.
