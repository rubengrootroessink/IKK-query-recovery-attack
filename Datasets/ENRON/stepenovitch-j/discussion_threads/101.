There have been some issues that I have noticed in the last week or so that I 
would like to address:

There have been several instances during the day, where we have noticed tasks 
that have not been completed during the night shift.  Pursuant to that, I 
would like to follow-up the January 18 meeting by outlining the duties that 
are expected to be completed by the end of each night shift.

The night duty task priorities are as follows: 

1.  Identify Hourly Position

2.  Manage Positions 

3.  Trade the remainder of On-peak & Off-peak.

*4.  Verbal Hourly P & L checkout 

*5.  Next-day pre-schedule checkout 

6.  Track each hour Index prices (PJM, NY-ISO & NEPOOL)

7.  Book Transfers to respective Hourly books from ST & LT books for position 
liquidations (Effectively making all the Hourly books flat)  * Instructions 
will be provided

8.  Develop and distribute the Shift Note

*9.  P&L to Enpower Reconciliation for each book (Hourly: Mid-west, 
Southeast, Northeast and ERCOT. Books should be flat by the a.m.)

* The highlighted items are the duties that need constant attention and are 
of the utmost importance.

If there are any problems or questions regarding positions, deals done during 
the day or schedule check-out difficulties, that cannot be resolved by 
investigation, please call or page either Juan, Jester, Richard or myself.

I know that we are still training some new guys, however, there are things 
that must be done at night.  If there us something that you do not know how 
to do, ask until you find an acceptable answer.

If there are any questions, give me a shout on my cell phone.

Thanks,

Don
