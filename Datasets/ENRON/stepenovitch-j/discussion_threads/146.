Teresa and I have split up the list you have given us.  I have contacted all 
those from PSEG to CALPINE.  I did not contact TRANSALTA, NRG, or SELECT 
because I did not have names.  If you have contacts for these three 
counterparties please give them to me and I will be happy to call.

Everyone I spoke to was extremely excited and interested in the balance of 
the day.  Three or four had already heard about it and were just waiting for 
launch.  One question I repeatedly received was "Will deals be available 
every hour or just sporadically during the day"?  I explained that both PJM 
and NEPOOL will be updated hourly and refresh automatically.  I also 
explained that these two products were purely financial and left my name and 
number for any problems transacting.  

I am sending EnronOnline shirts to PSEG, RELIANT, SEMPRA, MIRANT, NEW ENERGY, 
CONECTIV, and AEP.  These will be sent out Monday with a note reminding them 
about the balance of the day.  Overall, I received great responses.  Good 
Luck with the new product!!!  Let me know if I can do anything else.
