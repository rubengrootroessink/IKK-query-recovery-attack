Joe,

I see you are on your Enron on Line. At this time the hourly desk @ DTET
is not authorized to trade PJM financials on line. I use IM, to keep up
with some PJM financial traders at this time then call to transact the
trades. I use "  steveatet  " on IM. Do you use it? I can always keep up
with your BOD bid/offers on EOL, then call you from that.

Thanks.
