Won zero money but didn't lose much either.  I'll pass on the rodeo - I'm 
still recovering from a week of birthday celebrations topped by a weekend in 
Las Vegas - thanks for the invitation though.  I didn't realize that you were 
moving this weekend. For some reason I thought that it was another day.  I 
have to help a friend move tonight.  Unfortunately, I don't think that I'll 
be able to pitch in for your move this weekend because I'll be in NY. Sorry - 
although you probably have your hands full with the hourly boys helping you.

Enjoy the day!

Good Morning,

So you went to Las Vegas...That's awesome!!!  Did you win lots of money??

I didn't do much..I played golf yesterday and got some sun on my face...It
was so  beautiful yesterday, I can't wait for the summer!  I think I'm
leaving early and finish some packing.  I'm moving this weekend!  So, If I
don't e-mail you again its nothing personal!!  Have a great day and don't
work to hard!!   I think were going to the rodeo tonight, If you want to go
just give me a call.

Anyway, I'll talk to you tomorrow if I don't hear from you tonight!
