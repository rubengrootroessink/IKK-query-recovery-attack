Please do forward it to Joe!  Have him call when he is in Atlanta next and
Jo and I will meet he and his friends for drinks somewhere!  Maybe we'll
have a love connection of the "picky two!"

Thanks for recommending me; it is very flattering.  I have not even looked
at my resume in a very long time.  But, this is a great opportunity for me
to update it and get it out to a new company and a new market.  I love my
job, but I have been wondering lately what else is out there and it is good
to have you on my team!  I will get it to you as soon as I can update it.
Thanks!

Tina

Tina,
I think you know how much I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday.  I have just
forwarded your e-mail to the Personell Manager for the state of Florida and
I have given you a strong recommendation for hire.  I do not have a position
in Fort Lauderdale but recommended you be interviewed.

Please send me your resume because in banking positions are always changing.
Although there are always opportunites in the non-profit world I want to
save you for the Bank.  I think you would be a tremendous asset for this
company.  Please keep in touch.  Do you mind if I forward your e-mail
address to my son Joe?

Have a wonderful Easter and I hope the Easter Bunny is good to you.
Linda
