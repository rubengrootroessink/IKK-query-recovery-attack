The original schedule was 50 MW's TEP GEN @PV(EPE XCHANGE) - EPMI - 
SRP-MIRANT-CISO(T)PVD/SP15.  Mirant was cut by the CISO 3 mw HE 6, and 4 mw 
HE 24.  Please refer to Mirant tag #3205 for this revised schedule.   Mirant 
is sending the schedule real time.   I spoke with TEP and they are aware of 
the change.   

Thanks 
Stacy
