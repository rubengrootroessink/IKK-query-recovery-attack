We have length at PV all day on Sunday, and light load on Monday.  That is HE 
2-24 MST on Sunday, and HE1-6,23,24 on Monday.  The energy is parked with PNM 
at PV.  The cost is $125.  We are long in position manager.  Please route the 
sale to buy/resale #566175, and then make the sale under the ST-WBOM book.  
There is no HE 3 in Pacific time.  This may require some creativity on your 
part.   Please call me with any questions and good luck!
