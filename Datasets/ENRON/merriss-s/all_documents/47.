As many of you already know, Brett Hunsucker has accepted a new position with 
ERCOT in Texas.  His new position is a Client Representative for the new 
deregulated market.

We will be wishing Brett and Holly a fond farewell on Thursday evening.  The 
time and place will be determined later this week, but please plan on joining 
us to congratulate Brett on his new opportunity!
