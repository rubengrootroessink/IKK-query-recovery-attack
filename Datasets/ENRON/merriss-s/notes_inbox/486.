Dear Real-Timers,

I just wanted to drop you guys a line to say thanks for keeping better notes 
and more complete trade logs.  I can't tell you how much more efficiently I 
get things done when I find the counterparty trader's name, time of a 
conversation, and a confirm of MW and price values.

I really appreciate your efforts.

Sincerely,

Virginia
