Our upstream is Sempra, our Downstream is Mirant, it is a llh schedule that 
was cut by 1 mw HE 4-6, 23-24.  Mirant is taking it to real time, and 
Snohomish who is generating agrees with this.

Please call Mirant for the hours above to make sure everything is being 
handled.  The path is marked in lotus notes with a cut symbol.
