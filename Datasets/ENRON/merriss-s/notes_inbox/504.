FYI....

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website designed =
to=20
deliver market information on existing and potential customers to commercia=
l=20
trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management=
=20
reports to analyze Enron=01,s position within the key industries that we se=
rve. =20
Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential=
=20
customer information.  This system will standardize their resource tools an=
d=20
add consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines=20
information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit=20
Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information from=
=20
external data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to=
=20
identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and=20
search by region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the=
=20
prospecting process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects=
=20
improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospectin=
g,=20
Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and=
=20
Inactive Accounts.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are=

loaded, but financial deals will be included soon, as well as other=20
commodities. =20

Alternatively, you can also access the site from Enron's homepage, under th=
e=20
Information & Services section, go to the link called "EnTelligence".

To view deal data, a user will need to submit an eRequest and select either=
:=20
Trader, Manager, or Sr Manager security.  I would also recommend to add the=
=20
following applications to your eRequest: Dow Jones Interactive (DJI), and=
=20
Live Link.  DJI is to be able to view market information and Live Link is o=
ur=20
desktop documentation system which enables the user to view a contract from=
=20
your computer.

The following attachment is a sampling of a Market Penetration report=20
displaying a count of companies in the industry code "Electric Services" of=
=20
the total number Enron has dealt with and the total number of companies Enr=
on=20
has not dealt with yet.  Also, a sample of Enron Power Marketing Group's To=
p=20
customers for physical deals within the last 12 months.

Give the system a test drive and let us know what you think! Any questions,=
