Alicia:

For today you had pre-scheduled 29 MW for all hours and had a unit outage 
that started around 8:00 (I think).  For HE 12 - 24 you purchased 25 MW from 
us at $220.  For HE 13 - 24 you purchased 3 MW at $225.  Your schedule will 
therefore reflect 29MW through HE 11, 4 MW for HE 12 and 1 MW for HE 13-24.  
Deviation quantities and ISO purchases will be based on that schedule.

For Wed your  pre-schedule reflects 18 MW On Peak and 21 Off Peak.  Prices 
for tomorrow were 

Peak - $215
Off Peak - $110

We will work to buy this back as well.  We will not pre-schedule anything 
tomorrow morning for Friday and Saturday unless you give us the go ahead.

Prices for tomorrow
