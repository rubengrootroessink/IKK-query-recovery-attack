We parked some length with EL Paso for this morning (04/11) at PV.  We need 
to sell the energy at PV.  The length is in Enpower already.  Please make the 
sale at PV under ST-SW.  Aepco, MWD, TNP and LDWP should be buying.  The 
price for deal #577883 goes in the model...not the price you sold it at.

EPE length is in Enpower, deal# 577883, this will be out in RT Position 
Manager.  56mws for the day.
The schedule is as follows:

HE 1 8 mws
HE2 8 mws
HE3 8 mws
HE4 8mws
HE5 8mws
HE6 10mws
HE24 6mws

TOTAL  = 56mws

Please sell this power real time.
Check with the dispatchers EARLY, Lisa Gang's sheet shows everything you need.

Call Holdenn or myself with any questions.
Thanks,
Bill
