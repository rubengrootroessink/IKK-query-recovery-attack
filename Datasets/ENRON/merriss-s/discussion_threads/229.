Group,

For the third day in a row (4th time this week) I have received an email or 
call from Kathy at EPE asking the model to be resent because of simple 
errors.  Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking out 
with counterparties and running the CARP.  The ancillary service (spin) deals 
need to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular 
deal entry summary.  We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriate 
(which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston tries 
to check out March and April).  We do a good job trading for EPE and managing 
their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for this 
customer on deal entry.  I continue to see the same mistakes which suggests 
that procedure questions exist.  Please ask myself or a senior member of the 
group if you have any questions.  I look for us to improve going forward.

Thanks,

Bill
