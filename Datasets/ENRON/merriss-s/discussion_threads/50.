All of us are aware of the energy crisis confronting us, and the situation 
might get a lot worse this summer.  PGE has taken actions to reduce energy 
consumption, e.g., decreasing the amount of lighting within the building.  

In the spirit of energy conservation, Chris Calger and I are asking that you 
turn off your monitor(s) each day.  You do not need to log out of your 
computers to do this--simply press the monitor off button.  If you have any 
questions about how to turn off your monitor(s), check with Dave Steiner in 
our IT Department.

Thanks for your cooperation.
