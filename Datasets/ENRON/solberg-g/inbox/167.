Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from BPA. 

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can save some money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

Les
