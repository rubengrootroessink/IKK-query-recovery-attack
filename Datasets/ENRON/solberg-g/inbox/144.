Geir, wanted to pass along this most recent info from Anne regarding flying
from Seattle to Palau.  It seems better to just move our Hawaii tickets to
another date and purchase new tix flying out of Seattle.  That would be
$3000 total airline price for the wedding.  I don't know if you'd like to
stay at the Manta Bay hotel because you may not like scuba-diving with the
big manta rays.  Up to you...  She said she send us more info on Yap to be
arriving in the mail shortly, so we can make a decision about that.  I still
like Caroline's best for the first week and the wedding ceremony.  Let me
know so we can reserve or what ever... love you.
