Enron's General Counsel sent out an e-mail this morning defining data and document retention policies relating to SEC Investigations and Shareholder Class Action lawsuits.  The e-mail, which appears below, goes on to explain that we should otherwise return to "our normal electronic document retention policy."

I want to remind everybody that the new document retention requirements are in addition to this office's current document retention policy.  Specifically, the policies that we have agreed to with the California Attorney General remain in effect.  As a reminder, I have included our policy below.  Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and continue to comply with our data retention policies. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.
