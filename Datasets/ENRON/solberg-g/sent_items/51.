[Mark Hall]  The original path was IID(G)PV(EPEXCHANGE)-BPENERGY-PNM-EPMI-CISO for 50 mw's lightload, we were cut HE 23 by 27mw's & HE 24 by 28mw's.  Please refer to EPMI tag number 21935.  We were unable to find a buyer for the 55 mw's of length we now have.  We spoke with everyone in the upstream and they agreed to settle this schedule real-time.

The corresponding deal number for our purchase from PNM is:


587854.1	$135.00 	



We also received cuts on the following path

The original path was PINW(G)PV-AQUILLA-EPMI-CISO for 100mw's lightload, we were cut HE 23 & 24 by 28mw's.  Please refer to EPMI tag number 21938.  Were wer unable to find a buyer for the 56 mw's of length we now have.  We spoke with everyone in the upstream and they agreed to settle this schedule real-time.  

When you sell the 55 mw's HE 23 and 56 mw's HE 24 at Palo Verde please contact everyone in the upstream with the new sink.

The corresponding deal number for our purchase from AQUILLA is:


562225.1	$139.00
