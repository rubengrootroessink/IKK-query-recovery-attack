THERE WERE SOME ISO CUTS AND ISSUES YESTERDAY:

HE19: 
EPMI_CISO_DUCKS @MALIN. 
CUT THE SCHEDULE FROM 219MW TO 169MW.

HE23:
FLOWED 75MW FROM MALIN TO PALO VERDE. THERE ARE NO FINALS FOR THIS SCHEDULE. THE REASON WAS THAT WE WERE FIRST AWARDED 75MW CONG RELIEF. THEY THEN REPOSTED FINALS WITHOUT TELLING US. WE FOUND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR THAT THE 75MW SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE. INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE SCHEDULE AND PISSING OFF EVERYBODY I HAD BARRY AT THE ISO PUT IN THE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT GETTING CONG RELIEF BUT THE SCHEDULE DID FLOW.
