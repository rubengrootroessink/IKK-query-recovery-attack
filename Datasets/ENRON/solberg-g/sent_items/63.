Geir Solberg,

Scheduling Activity Report is using the following tables, these tables
might be locked while running this report
between 01:00AM-02:50AM CST, that is why this report takes more than 2
hours to complete. Please keep track on these tables during this
interval of time for removing the locks. Once we cross 02:50AM CST, SAR
will be executing within few minutes.
