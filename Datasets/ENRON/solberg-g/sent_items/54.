The ISO cut the one side of my wheel on HE24 on 4/13. 

I had a firm export at 4C (EPMI_CISO_BUNNY)  of 20 mw for a sale to powerex and a wheel EPMI_CISO_ TOBY at PALO going out at Silverpeak. 
They cut the sale to POWEREX and the following imports. They cut the following:

EPMI_CISO_BUNNY 20 to a 8
EPMI_CISO_TOBY IMPORT 12 to 4. 

All this while keeping my EPMI_CISO_TOBY Export at a 12. 

Basically they used both the WHEEL IMPORT/ FIRM IMPORT to Fill the WHEEL EXPORT.
