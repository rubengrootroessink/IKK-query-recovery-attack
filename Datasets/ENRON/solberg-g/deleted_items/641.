Geir,

Please enter a few test deals on Saturday after the databases are brought back up.  There should be an EnPower stage for NETCO shortcut and an EnPower Stage for estate shortcut from the start menu in terminal server.  You will need to re-boot your system to see the new shortcuts.  The database are scheduled to be back up after 4 PM.  If they are not back up before the end of your shift, please ask your successor to enter a few deals, etc.  If you have any problems call David Poston.  (I'll be out of town due to a family emergency this weekend.)

David's numbers:
713.962.0973 cell
713.345.7834 office

Thanks, 

Susan Amador
