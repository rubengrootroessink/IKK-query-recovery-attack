Hon,
So far, by my calculations, the wedding costs are as follows:
$1,704: ceremony, massages, pedicure, manicure, dinner, videographer,
photographer
$2,500: RT plane tickets
$2,000: Caroline's Resort stay

That is $6,200! Plus with the reception:
$475: wedding package, case of champagne for 100 people
$1,100 appx.: buffet
$330: beer/wine

That is a total of $8,105!!! Are you okay with that? It doesn't include our
spending money in Palau either... I guess it is pretty good considering it
includes our honeymoon. I just wanted to let you know. Not to mention
invitations and other miscellaneous... We need to sell than Bronco!

Love you! P.
