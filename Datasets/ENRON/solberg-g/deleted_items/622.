Hon,
I just received the fax from Palau Pacific Resort about our wedding
documentation. Are you a little bit worried that if you marry me as an
American citizen, that it won't be accepted when we move to Norway? They
don't know you are an American citizen, and that means if you marry as one,
I won't be considered your legal wife in Norway???...

P.
