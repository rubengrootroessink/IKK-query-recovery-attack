Attention UBS Warburg Energy Users:

Please be aware that IT will begin migrations to UBSW Energy this evening.  Please log off of your machines tonight.

When you arrive in the morning, you will login with your Enron ID and password.  You will be required to change your password immediately.

You will also have an email in your Inbox tomorrow morning explaining your "next steps".

If you have any questions, please call 3-1411.

Thanks,

UBSW Energy Global Infrastructure
