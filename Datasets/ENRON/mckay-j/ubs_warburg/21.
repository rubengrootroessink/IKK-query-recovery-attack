Jon,
Dealing with Canadian issues and NETCO.  Original thought was that legacy deals go away and we can do in Canada as we do in US.  Unfortunately feedback is that currency issue will still exist.  In your minds eye, will it put Canada out of biz if we require that during first 45 days only "US like" transactions occur?  

Your feedback would be great.
Thanks,
Frank
