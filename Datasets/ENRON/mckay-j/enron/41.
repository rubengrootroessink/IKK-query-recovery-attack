Chris,

I have several questions on these new product types.  Could you help me out so that I can send this for testing?

Is this the index for all products?   The Index shall be the settlement price for the last scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.
Which ones will be the locations you will be using?
Please match a Risk Book assignment to each location
Who will be the trader?
Who will be the risk book administrator?
What will be the terms trading? (start and end dates)


Please let me know when you get all this information.

Thanks,
Melba Lozano
