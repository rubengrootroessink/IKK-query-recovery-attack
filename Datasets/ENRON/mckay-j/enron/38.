The reason you don't see the origination for Jon McKay for the Sithe deal for $1,229,328 in the YTD and June Revenue by Originator metrics is because I wanted to capture all origination for just the originations group.  I included origination for Rob, Paul Devries and Kyle Kitigawa per Rob's request.  I checked the gas book for June and Jon's origination was recorded by the risk group.  If you have any further questions with regards to this matter, I will be back in the office on August 27, 2001.

Regards,

Grant
