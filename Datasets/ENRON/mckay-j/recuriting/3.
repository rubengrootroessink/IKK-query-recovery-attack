Hi Jon,

My name is Lawrence Truong, I'm a friend of Geri
Greenall.  Actually, she was one of my CPMT assistants
in my last year at Scurfield.  I was in contact with
Geri recently and she suggested that I contact you
with regard to my interest in energy trading.

This is the primary reason that I'm writing to you
today is to ask you for some advice on the energy
trading business.  I was hoping that we could get
together for coffee or a drink sometime to discuss
your business.

I understand that you are completing the CFA this year
by writing level 3.  I am also writing level 3 this
year in Calgary.  I know that with the exam looming
ahead that you'll be extremely busy preparing, so if
your schedule permits maybe we can meet sometime the
week after the exam?

In anycase, thanks for your time and good luck with
the exam.  I hope to hear back from you.  If you wish,
I can be reached at 293-2156.  Cheers and have a nice
day.

Lawrence
