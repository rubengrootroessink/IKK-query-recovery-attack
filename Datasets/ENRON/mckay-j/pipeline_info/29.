Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 28, 2001

Despite the end of November business occurring this Friday, the
operating conditions for December 1 will remain, more or less,
unchanged.  Therefore, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern)
requires customers continue to balance their daily physical demands with
daily physical supply as the new month business is set up.

Texas Eastern is continuing to operate under the Critical System Warning
issued November 26, 2001.  Based on anticipated system operations and
weather conditions, as stated below, Texas Eastern is requiring that all
customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts
and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide
warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system
significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning
shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.
