To:  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers 
and Shippers Under All Rate Schedules

Re: Operational Flow Order

On Monday, November 26, 2001, Transco issued a System 
Imbalance Notice advising of an unacceptable level of 
transportation imbalances and requesting that all shippers 
and customers on Transco's system (referred to herein as 
"Buyers") avoid any future positive imbalance and resolve 
existing positive imbalances.  Transco indicated that, 
absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may 
be required to implement the provisions of Section 52 of 
the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff.  
On Tuesday, November 27, 2001, Transco again issued a 
notice requesting that Buyers ensure that physical receipts 
and physical deliveries were in balance on a daily basis 
and reiterating its request that Buyers reduce any positive 
imbalances immediately. 

Due to the lack of effective voluntary compliance with its 
previous requests to reduce transportation imbalances, 
Transco continues to experience unmanageable levels of 
positive transportation imbalances and all operational 
tools have been exhausted.  Transco can no longer tolerate 
daily positive imbalances in the face of warmer-than-normal 
temperatures expected for its market area.  

Consequently, due to severe operational concerns and in 
order to protect the integrity of Transco's system, Transco 
hereby issues a system-wide Imbalance Operational Flow 
Order (OFO) to all Buyers pursuant to the terms of Section 
52 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC 
Gas Tariff.  The OFO shall be effective as of the beginning 
of the gas day on December 1, 2001 and shall continue until 
further notice.  All Buyers shall be required to ensure 
that positive imbalances (i.e. receipts into Transco's 
system in excess of deliveries from Transco's system) be 
limited to 5% on a daily basis.  Any daily imbalance in 
excess of 5% and 1,000 dts shall constitute an unauthorized 
OFO Imbalance and shall be subject to penalties pursuant to 
Section 52.5 of the General Terms and Conditions.  Such 
penalties will be based upon the aggregate daily imbalance 
per rate schedule for each Buyer. 

Buyers that have a negative imbalance (i.e. receipts into 
Transco's system less than deliveries from Transco's 
system) will not be subject to the provisions of this OFO.  

If you have any questions, please contact Terry C. Fitch at 
(713)215-3361 or John E. McGrath at (713)215-2514.
