Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive=20
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of=20
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective=20
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional=20
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent=20
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to=20
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further=20
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its=20
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently=20
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers=20
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the=20
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with=20
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to=20
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool=20
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,=20
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits=20
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may=20
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies=20
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.
