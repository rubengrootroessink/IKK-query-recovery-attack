Scott,

I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.

Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920)
Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007)
Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960)
Encal			C$(14,574,960)


Howard Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.

Regards,

Jon
