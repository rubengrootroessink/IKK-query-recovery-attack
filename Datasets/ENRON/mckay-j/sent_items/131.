Greg,

Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipel=
ine declared as its force majure volume?

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of "force majeure" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.
