Hello,

Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a cha=
nge'n with my life.

First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I d=
rove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't t=
hat bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You woul=
d have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It =
kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture,=
 and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com. =
 Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some =
pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t=
he traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from=
 New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do th=
is drive?"  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She re=
nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http:=
//astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She too=
k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thi=
ng is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. T=
he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro=
up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo=
w.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the=
 Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same bu=
siness but none-the-less for the same company.

Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin=
g to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mer=
e coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really=
 want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part=
, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my hou=
se anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have n=
o problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiat=
ion is in the lead as it stands.

Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me=
 borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV sta=
nd, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store=
 the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for =
the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in H=
ouston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take =
is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furni=
ture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other =
things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk ab=
out what is best.

Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the s=
ame), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself fo=
r trying!

Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.

Love,

Jon =20

Hi Jon,

Thought I would drop you a note to see how you are
doing.  I haven't heard from you for ages and was
wondering what you are up to.

If Beth is down for Stampeed say Hi to her for me.

We are slowly getting things sorted out and under
control around here.  We have all of the major inside
projects done and Ron is just about finished putting
up the fence.  This is good as they have just posted a
caution bear in the area sign on the mailboxes.  The
fence should keep them away from the house, I hope.

I sent pictures of the place to your mum so reminde
her to show them to you the next time you see her.  I
really like the place.  Lots of work to keep me busy
and out of trouble but not as much work as the house
and yard in Calgary.

Rons mum coming for a visit on 18 July.  Will take her
out and about in the Yukon and a couple of places in
Alaska.  I am looking forward to going on a tour
again.

Well should run for now.  All is well with me.  Going
to the gym 3 days a week and am working on quitting
smoking, again.

Lots of Love

Donna
