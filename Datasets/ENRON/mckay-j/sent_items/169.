Jay,

Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.

Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.


Regards,

Jon
