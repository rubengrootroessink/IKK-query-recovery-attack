John,

I have added the curves to a curve fetch file in O:\ERMS\Excel Queries\JMcKayCurveFetch.xls
I did not know which curves to get rid of, but if you go through it just hide the ones that you don't want, you won't have to go back and add them later.  I have access to the folder and file, but I don't have rights to run the macro.  I have tacked the curves you requested to the last four columns of each sheet (one sheet for dailies and the other sheet for basis curves).  Call with any questions.

Adam

Adam,

The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.

If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jon
