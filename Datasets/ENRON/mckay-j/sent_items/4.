Hello John,

Your home looks great with a sold sign on it. Yes it is sold. The only thing
I need now is your new address, phone # and any new e-mail addresses you
might have.

Good luck John I owe you a round of golf at a course of your choosing, say
hi to the gang and I will be in touch.

Have a great day,

Rod Forsythe
