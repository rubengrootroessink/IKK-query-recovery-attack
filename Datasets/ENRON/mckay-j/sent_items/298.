Hellllooooo,

How are you doing?  I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but=
 there has been a lot going on these days.  The move still is not quit comp=
lete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a=
 weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.  I ended up selling you curio (=
sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV. cabinet.  Hence I have a cheque for you t=
hat needs to be sent, or picked up if you like?

The move has gone pretty well all things considered.  We managed to fit two=
 2000 square foot homes into one 900 square foot apartment.  It kind of has=
 the cluttered eclectic New York apparent look to it.........you know the s=
ame as your basement in Summerland.  Nothing major got damaged, in the move=
 so that helps.  I still have to switch over my car registration and insura=
nce, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.

I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.  I've gone to two c=
ollege football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre=
 Dame, and one in Austin to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.  T=
hey were both day trips about two and a half hours from Houston, so the dri=
ves were not that bad.  Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,00=
0 other fans.  It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by th=
at many people.  Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of Housto=
n.  This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toron=
to each year.  There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but bot=
h of them had a bad day.  One of them crashed and the other finished way ba=
ck.  The highlight was that Enron had sponsored a car just for that race th=
at was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.  =
Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pr=
etty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.

Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to g=
ive it some time.  Enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all=
 the wrong reasons.  It sounds like one of the "way high-ups" had a questio=
nable kick back deal with Enron that has come under attack.  The Board of D=
irectors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are st=
arting to ask questions now.  It looks like my plan for early retirement is=
 out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 =
to $25.  So much for getting stock options as your bonus.

Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.  Th=
ere seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media c=
an latch its teeth into rip apart.  I'm actually getting tired of all the r=
umors and fear mongering that is going on.  I figure if my time is up, than=
 so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a wast=
e of energy.

I hope the new job goes well.  I'm glad to hear that your back working, I w=
as starting to worry about you a little.  You know what can happen when peo=
ple lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to st=
op going out all together.

Anyway, its time for me to start working so I have to go now.  Take care an=
d have fun at your new job!

Love

Jon

PS.  I lost your address in my move.  Could you please email me your physic=
al address so I can mail you the money I owe you. Thanks

Hi
Thought I would drop you a quick note.  I do not know if your mom told you =
but I went back to work just over a week ago.  Wal-Mart is opening a new st=
ore here so I applied and got a job.  We are in the process of setting up t=
he store, shelves etc. plus stocking them.  Lots of work but I have a good =
partner to work with.  It took us about three days to find eachother but we=
 work well together and make sure we head for the same area each day.
Winter is here.  We have about 4 inches of snow so far.  It is only about -=
4 so not cold at all.  Not much news other than going back to  work so will=
 run for now.  Drop me a line and let me know how all of the mess in New Yo=
rk has been effecting you.
Say hi to Beth for me as well.    =20
Lots of Love   Donna
