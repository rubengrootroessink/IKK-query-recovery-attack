Jon, 
I still have not received the information from Enron to complete the test run for July.  Please forward this information to me as soon as possible.  Please also send a copy to Shayroz Gaidhar as she will be the person assembling the information on a monthly basis.  Her e-mail address is sgaidhar@deloitte.ca .  Please contact me immediately if there will be a problem getting this information to me within the next two days.
