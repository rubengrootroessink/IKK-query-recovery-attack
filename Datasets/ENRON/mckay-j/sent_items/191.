Dear Mr. Raffaele,

My name is Jon McKay and I just moved from Calgary, Canada to Houston.  Just prior to moving I passed the Level III C.F.A. exam and now find my self in need of a sponsor to join the Houston society.  I was wondering if you could put me in contact with some of the local charter holders so that I could obtain sponsor ship and join the Houston society.  I was not member of the society in Calgary, as I was waiting to pass the third examination before joining, but I could provide some contacts in Calgary that hold charters, who would a test to my character.  If you had a local membership list, or even just a list of Enron employee who have C.F.A. Charters that I could contact, it would be greatly appreciated.

If you can help please contact me at (w) 713 853-4810, (h) 713 225-1230 or, at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

Thank you,

Jon McKay
