Hi John, this is Kim.  Royal LePage Relocations will handle absolutely
everything.  You don't have to worry about a thing.  They will pay you when
all is done.  If you need to get a hold of them, just let me know and I can
forward a phone number and contact.

Hope it's not too hot down there!!

Take care,
Kim

Hi Rod,

I'm sorry I have not been reachable but I was waiting until I had all the
info you needed before I contacted you.  The new info is as follows:

#1808, 909 Texas Ave.
Houston, Texas, 77002

jonathan.mckay@enron.com

(h) 713 225-1230
(w) 713 853-4810
(f) 713 646-8453


Do you know what happens next?  Do I need a lawyer?  Do any other
provisions remain?  Any idea how I get paid? Any help would be appreciated!

Best Regards,

Jon


As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble
Beach..........Just kidding.

   Hello John,

   Your home looks great with a sold sign on it. Yes it is sold. The only
   thing
   I need now is your new address, phone # and any new e-mail addresses you
   might have.

   Good luck John I owe you a round of golf at a course of your choosing,
   say
   hi to the gang and I will be in touch.

   Have a great day,

   Rod Forsythe
