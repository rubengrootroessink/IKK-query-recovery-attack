Jay,

The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.

Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  

Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.

Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.

Happy 4th of July,

Jon
