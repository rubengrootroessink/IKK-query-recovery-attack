Hey Stephen,

Glad to hear the funds finally showed up.  It would be helpful to me if
we
could hook back up together in the next little while.  I'd like to get
your
opinion on a few different thoughts that I've had.  I need to do some
"financial planning" so to speak.

Let me know how your schedule is looking

Thanks,

Jon
