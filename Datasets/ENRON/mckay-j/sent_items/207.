People down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!

I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).

Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.

Jon

Hey Jonny, what's up?  Jeez, just heard about the bombings, how is that
affecting you guys?  Let me know what's going on....

Scotty told me about your house being sold....that's great.  I think I'm
going over with him tonight to start clearing out some stuff...I'll grab
the plants and the light like we discussed....Scott may store the poker
table for me.  Let me know if there's anything else you need us to do...

Hope everything's okay down there...
