Thanks Jon,
The work I've been doing here mostly involves project finance and balance
sheet lending to foreign companies.  I'm not necessarily looking to do this
from Calgary though.  When I look at my transferable skills, they basically
boil down to credit analysis, negotiation and documentation.

I've been on EDC's mining and power team for the past year and I really find
the work extremely interesting.  On the power side, Suzanne has a friend who
works for Power-X in Van. as a trader/marketer and his line of work sounds
extremely interesting.  I've talked to Alan W. about his work before and he
said marketing is marketing no matter what the product.  So gas is also of
interest.  This would be a bit of a career change for me and would need to
learn the ropes, but I have no ego.

Also of interest (outside of Enron) is equity research (for an investment
dealer), corporate/project finance (for power/O&G sponsors), and even
investment banking (though Andy has turned almost turned me off on this!).
I'm working on a big power deal in Mexico and wouldn't mind being on the
sponsor's side of the table (vs. banker's).  I'm sure TransAlta has several
generation projects that could be interesting.  I'd be on more familiar
ground in any of these roles and could pretty much hit the ground running.

Is this specific enough?  If nothing else, I'll be able to expand my contact
list to more than 2 (you and Andy!)

Paul
