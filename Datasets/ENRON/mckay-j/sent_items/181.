How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.   

Let me know what you want to do.

Jon

Jon, I am unsure if you got my message the other day, but I am looking at
doing around 20000 US worth of currency.  The bank last week was charging me
a couple of hundred points, so anything less would be appreciated.  I would
like to hold off longer, but my first tuition bill is due Sept 10, so I need
the money by then.

If you can't help, I will probably try and cut a deal with my bank or a new
bank down here.

Thanks!

Jeff
