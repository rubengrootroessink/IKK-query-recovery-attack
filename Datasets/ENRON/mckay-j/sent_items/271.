Received a phone call on Thursday, December 13th approx. 9:15am from Royal =
Edmondson, Gas Control Manager for Reliant Entex.  He was trying to locate =
Victoria Versen and was eventually  transferred to me.  He wanted to make s=
ure Enron was delivering gas to the Entex's city gates.  He asked if  Enron=
 was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I =
told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gat=
es were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tenne=
ssee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility tha=
t the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city ga=
tes were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was autom=
atically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As =
per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what th=
e storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the st=
orage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on t=
hat matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved=
 & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome wit=
h Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered. =20

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is =
automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was =
being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I=
 did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have=
 not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.  =20

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provid=
e too much information without knowing his full intentions.



Thanks,
