Jon,

I have updated your ADM with Canadian products - you will need to refresh to see them.  Will you be needing to manage them on Stack as well?  I did not update the jmckay1.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Hi Stephanie,

My name is Jon McKay and I used to trade in Canada for Enron.  Could I please get access to all of the Canadian markets as I still have opportunities to trade certain locations from down here.  My login ID is ADM95363, or I can be found under JMcKay1.

Thanks for you help

Jon
