Hi Jon,

Enron currently markets about 4.5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day.
I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12bcf a day that the NIT number can  easily be double this. It doesn't appear that Enron markets 50% of Alberta's gas each day...yet.  

I hope this answers your question, let me know if you need anything else.

Ian

Start with Peggy Hedstrom and find out if this is accurate and get back to me.

Thanks,

Jon

Jon
We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in Toronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in Alberta. 
1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
2.  Can we publically make this representation?  

Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your analysts puts together for the morning meeting? 

Many thanks
Kate
