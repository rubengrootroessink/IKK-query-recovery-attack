Melba,

Chris Lambie, Chris Dorland, Mike Cowan, and Chad Clark will be managing products.  All Canadian traders will need transaction capabilities.  I do not think that any "view only" access will be needed.

Thank you,

Jon


PS. I am moving to Houston permanently tomorrow and will have to pass this responsibility off to Chris Lambie.

Please let me know who will be managing the new basis west product types.  Also which trader will need read only access. 

Thank you,

Melba
