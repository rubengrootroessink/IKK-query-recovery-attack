Don't worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.  When working out the number of days on excel, if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days (including leap years).

Jon,  Thanks for everything.  There was a small error in the buy sheet for haul - all yesterday.  I have attached a correct one.  the problem was the final buy numbers did not divide by the days in the month evenly.  the total is out 11 GJs.  Just let me know what to do.  sorry!  Also, for February on a long term contract covering a leap year, do we need to incorporate a different formula to buy for that leap month with 29 days.
