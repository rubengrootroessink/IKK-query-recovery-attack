Hi Jonathan.  The attached email contains the requested information regarding Enron security policies.  Additionally, the enclosed document addresses the internal/external issue.  This is the set of information D & T asked me to pass to you to send on to them.

 

Thanks!

Jay,

Attached are the Enron Code of Ethics, which includes Enron's IT Security Policies for employees, and the Enron IT Control Standards, which are the standards against which IT controls are audited by Arthur Andersen, our internal auditors. As you are aware, every employee must sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by the Code of Ethics once a year.

In addition to these documented policies, Enron also has a group, IT Compliance - the group I work in, that is responsible for managing Enron's IT risks and ensuring compliance with policies.

I hope this is what you were looking for. Please call if there is anything else we can help with.

Mark Thibodeaux
Director - IT Compliance
Enron Corp.
