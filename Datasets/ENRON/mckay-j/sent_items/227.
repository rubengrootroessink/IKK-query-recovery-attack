Adam,

So far so good!  I'm only concerned with being able to print it out on one page.  If you need more space turn the print page to landscape and use smaller font.  Keep making the font smaller until either we get everything on one page or until you can't read the printout.  Do you need me to do anything?

Subject:	Update on Tetco Map

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to show you the progress so far on the Map.  It is pretty rough.  I am worried about Space constraints on the sheet.  As a result, I have cut out Armagh, Lilly, Entriken, Shermansdale, and Bernville on the northern pipe.  Storage points are square and the data in yellow backgrounds.  Compressors are circles with clear data table backgrounds.  I would like any guidance you guys have on how to fit more points in, or which points to drop.  I want to add Transco at Linden, and I am researching other interconnects.

Also, I talked to the IT guys and I will have the links for the Map data up by this evening.
I had signed up for a training class this Thurs and Fri, but forgot to mention it last Friday.  I will have the Map finished by Wednesday, and I will fix any problems after the training class Thurs and Fri.

Thanks,

Adam
