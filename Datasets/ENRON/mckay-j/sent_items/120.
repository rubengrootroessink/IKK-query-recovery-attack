This is what I know so far... the South Wapiti inlet header blew up.  The inspection team is going out today to survey the damage.  From speaking to Ron Johnson (operator @ S Wapiti), he feels the damage is significant thus many parts and valves will have to be changed out.  Depending on crews and availability of parts, the plant will be 0 (zero) for at least 2 days if not until mid next week.  South Wapiti produces approximately 80% of Iroquois Creek meter thus 200,000 GJ will be off until the plant is back up.

I will keep you informed on any new information.

Des

There has been a line rupture at the South Wapiti plant which has resulted
in about 200 mmcf off the NOVA system.  Des doesn't have any details as yet
other than we will likely lose about 5000 gj of production today.  Her info
so far says that no one was hurt but the fire trucks are there.  We'll keep
you posted.
