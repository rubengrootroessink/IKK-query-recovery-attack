I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  Geof Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.

Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.

Regards,

Jon

I have noticed that there is still a sizeable chunk of change in my bank
account.  Did you get the check?

How are you settling into things down there?  Stuff was pretty crazy around
here last week.  They cancelled classes on Tuesday and delayed them on Wed.
We also had many vigils and moments of silence.  A couple of my friends here
were directly impacted, in addition to one of my profs.  Not good.  Kind of
makes you feel like moving back to Canada.  Other than that, we have started
to learn some pretty cool things in our organizational behavior class, and
sharpened up our excel skills in a decision sciences class.  School is fun.
