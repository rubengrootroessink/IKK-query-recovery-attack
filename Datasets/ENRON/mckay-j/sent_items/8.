Hi Jonathan, 
Our compliance department has just contacted us back regarding your request to hold a small cash account here to pay your RSP fees each year.  Their suggestion is that we sell the Janus mutual funds and convert this money to US funds then transfer it to your Dane Rascher account in the US because you are now a US resident and the Investment regulations want it handled that way.
You could simply send us a cheque for the RSP fees when we notify you each June. 
I hope you had a good holiday season, did you get home for Christmas?  Let me know by phone if we can proceed as suggested above and I will look after it for you in the new year.  Thanks.
