I need to refresh this quote:
John, this time, can I just have the Sumas piece instead of the all in price?
Volumes are on the attachment.

John: Sumas Offer please.  Dec-Mar02 and then May02-Nov02.
Dutch: Nymex piece.




I attached the numbers this time.  Again, I'm  looking for your offer for a fixed price, Northwest Pipeline sumas index swap   
 
Thanks
