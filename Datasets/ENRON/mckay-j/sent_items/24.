Glen,

YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.

Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com

How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.

Jon
