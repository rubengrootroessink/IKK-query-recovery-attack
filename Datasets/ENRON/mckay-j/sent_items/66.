The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.  But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.

I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.

Regards,

Jon

Has your view that we are likely to see prices trending down changed based on the AGA numbers that we saw yesterday?  Or is that just a short term fluctuation?
