Hey Jeff,

How's it going.   Things down here are actually very slow.  They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.  In the mean time no one is trading.  I sit around most of the day and play games.  I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.  The old hurry up and wait.   Beth's (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.  She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.  Things down here could not have gone worse for her. I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.

Are you an unsecured Enron creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?  How are thing there?  Are you liking school?

I'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).  I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.  You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.

Take care and I hope to see you in cow town.

Jon

I hope that everything is going okay down there for you, I talked to Chris
last week and he said that everyone was kind of just sitting around waiting
to find out what is going to happen with the trading group.  What did they
do with your girlfriends department?  Is she still there?

Are you going to head home for Christmas?  If so, when?  I am heading home
next Friday, and will be around till after New Years.  We should all try and
plan some time to get together if you are going to be there.

If not, I hope that things go okay and you have a Merry Christmas.
