Just in the process of selling the house.   The prospective buyers need to secure financing.  How much are you looking to convert as I am long some USD from liquidating some investments in Canada and may be able to help convert some currency earlier.

Let me know.

Regards,

Jon

PS. How is the good life treating you?
