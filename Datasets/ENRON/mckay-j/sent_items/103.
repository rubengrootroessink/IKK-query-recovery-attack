hey John,

As a Blue Devil alumni, I have been able to do the impossible - actually was able to secure tickets to the Duke football game with some team from Georgia on 10/6

got an extra one in case you wanted to bring your girlfriend too!!

If you want to practice, check out the audio attached...

 
I'll see if we can crash my old fraternity's party as well!
