Glen,

So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hi=
tting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are t=
hings going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running ther=
e course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "Bud Fox" for i=
nsider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think Bud might =
have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  =
I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has=
 fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another com=
pany down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash=
 and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of =
got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can sta=
y where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of lik=
e sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can=
 try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the prob=
lem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence t=
he soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note,=
 see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could b=
e worse.

I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forwar=
d to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I g=
et in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th.  Maybe=
 we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  =
Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say =
hi to one of the waitress for me tonight


Jon
