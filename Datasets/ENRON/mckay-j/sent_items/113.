Lucy,

Almost all basis in Canada is quoted in USD, normal convention is to quote the fixed price in CAD.  I will get Ian Cooke to send you the historical basis for AECO (in USD).  If you want a currency curve to work the numbers back into Canadian dollars we can also get you that, but I'm not sure what that would tell you.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Jon

Ian - could you please forward our historical AECO curve to Lucy  - Thanks

John,

Hello again!  Is there anyone up there that can e-mail me historical AECO basis in CAD and USD for the last 5 years?

Many thanks and kind regards,

Lucy
