Hi Jon,

I wanted to ask if I could use the Video 1 Boardroom for Leadership Training tomorrow.  It is available, but I was informed that I needed to ask you first if we have an outside guest.  Michele Brown is the facilitator (the numbers on the board should mean nothing to her as she is not from the industry) and everyone else is internal.  We were unable to book our regular room at the E&Y Tower and Video 2 is a little crowded.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Carla
