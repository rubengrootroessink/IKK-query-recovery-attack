The numbers looked good for the 18th's report of numbers for the 15th.  We will watch them closely for a couple of days.  So far 1 for 1.

Thanks,

Jon

The basis numbers published for the 14th were quite different for three of the numbers published

Sumas CashSpread:  Correct basis:  -.495;  Basis Published: -.315
Aeco CashSpread:     Correct basis:  --.478;  Basis Published: -.536
Sumas June Spread:     Correct basis: -.45;  Basis Published +.055

The Sumas June spread is WAY off.

Would you be able to get the numbers fixed for the 15th publication.  We have received a phone call for three days in a row now from Lavo wondering why we marked our curves so off.  We have not marked our curves wrong but the report is wrong.  If this schedule helps I can send it tonight as well.  As I have stated before it would not be correct to get Aeco and Sumas IM numbers for ANY pubcode other that Sumas-US/IM or Aeco-Cdn/IM.  The other pubcodes are not correct 100% of the time.
