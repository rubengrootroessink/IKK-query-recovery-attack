Hey Jonny, sorry I missed you over New Years....I went out to TO on the 28th
for a week....life's been kind of shitty lately so I probably wouldn't have
been much fun anyway...hope you had a good xmas and new year....how're
things down there and with Enron?

As you can see, I have a new email address and phone number...
