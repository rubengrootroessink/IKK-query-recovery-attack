Things are going awesome down here, I spent all of last week rowing around the ocean (not as much fun as it sounds!), and spent the weekend with a couple of buddies in Quebec City (also not quite as fun as it sounds!).  
 
I can't believe the people that I have met down here, everyone is really friendly, and all have interesting stories/pasts!  You should seriously think about coming down here, I can't think of another place that I would rather be!
 
Anyway, I will let you guys know a little more when I finally get my computer, as I am using one in a common lounge area (right beside the pool table in my residence!).  
 
Any new information on currency?  I am probably going to have to think about converting it over pretty soon.
