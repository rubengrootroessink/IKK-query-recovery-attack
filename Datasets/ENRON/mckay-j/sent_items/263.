Dale,

Thanks for the email.  I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under Canadian tax law given my status, we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.  I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.

Regards,

Jon

Hi Jonathan, 
A couple of questions for you: 
1) Have you proceeded with opening an account at Dane Rauscher yet? 
2) Your RSP account has a small debit of $50.00, probably due to RSP holding fees charged to the account for 2001.  We either need a cheque from you for the $50.00 or we need to sell $50.00 worth of something to generate the $50.00 in the account.
Just drop me a note or call regarding how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.
