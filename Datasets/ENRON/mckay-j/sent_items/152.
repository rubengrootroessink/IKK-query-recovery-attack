Call me on this one.  I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X.  Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.

Hope all is going well.

Boardwalk are looking at hedging the gas for their properties in Saskatchewan.  What would you recommend or a financial hedge?  AECO, Empress??
