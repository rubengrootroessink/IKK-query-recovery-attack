Send us a cheque and we will give you screen.  Hope the move went well and you're not sweltering too badly in Houston!

Hi Laura,

I hope all is going well.  The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.  I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the Enron fee rather than retail.

Hit them down the middle,

Jon
