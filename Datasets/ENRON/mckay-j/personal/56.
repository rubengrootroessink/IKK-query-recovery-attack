Awesome, I owe you many beers when I get back at Christmas (assuming you are
also home at xmas!).

You can send me the check to:
Jeff Pearson T'03
Tuck School of Business
316 Byrne Hall
Dartmouth College
Hanover NH, 03755-9000

I will courier you a check for the money on Tuesday!

If possible, can you please also courier the check to me, I have to pay my
tuition by the 10th and need to ensure that I have the money.  I will
include an extra 15 on the check to cover the cost of the courier!

Thanks

How about 1.5460 as the rate.  I'll just send you a cheque for
USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott
agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).  Where should I
send the cheque?
