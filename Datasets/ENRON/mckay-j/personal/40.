Hi
Thought I would drop you a quick note.  I do not know if your mom told you but I went back to work just over a week ago.  Wal-Mart is opening a new store here so I applied and got a job.  We are in the process of setting up the store, shelves etc. plus stocking them.  Lots of work but I have a good partner to work with.  It took us about three days to find eachother but we work well together and make sure we head for the same area each day.
Winter is here.  We have about 4 inches of snow so far.  It is only about -4 so not cold at all.  Not much news other than going back to  work so will run for now.  Drop me a line and let me know how all of the mess in New York has been effecting you.
Say hi to Beth for me as well.     
Lots of Love   Donna
