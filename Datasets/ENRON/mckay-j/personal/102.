We will be spending our first evening together at the luxurious "Uncle
Bill's".  The website is currently under  construction, so it is
unavailable.  I think you are familiar with the accommodations....

Friday we will get up and drive, drive, drive to the "emerald waters" of
Destin, FL.  Our trip is approximately 582.9 miles or 10 hrs, 26 minutes.
We are staying at a Holiday Inn on the beach.  Please see
www.holidayinndestin.com for information on the accommodations.

Saturday we will lounge on the beach in the morning and then make our way
to hot and humid New Orleans for an evening of revelry.  The trip is 249.7
miles, or 4 hours, 52 minutes.  We will be staying at the International
House.  It can be seen at  www.ihhouse.com.

Sunday we will be in no great rush to leave, I need to find out more about
what the music festival is all about.  We will be staying at the Lancaster
in Houston, located at www.lancaster.com.  The drive is 5 hrs, 53 minutes
and approximately 347.8 miles.

Monday, we rest, but need to be around in case the movers come.

We will have logged 1,180.4 miles on the Volvo and spent 21.183 hours in
the car together....
