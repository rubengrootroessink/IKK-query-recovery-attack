Hi Jon,
 
Thought I would send that e-mail to Beth but my  computer says the address you gave me is not a valid address.  Maybe you  could e-mail me the correct one.  Anyway seeing as I am interrupting your  work day I might as well carry on.  
 
I sure do worry about you two, living and working  in what is sure to be a hot spot for who knows what.  You don't think you  could talk Beth into moving to Canada.  I know we are not safe either but  Houston is so far away and maybe  we are just a little  safer.  I watched Oprah yesterday and she had people in the know  on  about the safety of the airlines.  Those people said it is not safe to fly  so how are we to return to normal?  It is going to take months to train air  marshalls.  Are you sure you are going to Florida for  Thanksgiving?   What are the thoughts for Christmas?  Think about  Calgary,
you could have dinner with the family, visit your  friends and maybe go skiing.  The bad thing is you have to fly here.   Anyway you can let me know.
 
I talk to Grandpa almost every day.  He is  having a hard time.  He is very lonely.  I talked to the nurse at the  hospital where my Mum is.  She had a bad spell and was threatening to  commit suicide.  A psychiatrist evaluated her and prescribed some  medication because she is so anxious.
He said he thought she had vascular dementia and  not alzheimers because she was able to answer questions.  They were  not all the right answers but he said, a person with alzheimers isn't  able to figure out that it was a question and therefore respond.  She did  have radiation treatment long ago on the back of her head for cancer.  I  always wondered if damage was done at that time.  I'm telling you this so  you don't feel so threatened by the disease in the family.   Your Dad  was laughing and said: " Wouldn't it be scary if my Mum ended up being the  most with it of the folks ?"   I know life just gets more  depressing.  
 
I will send some pictures from Dad's birthday to  you soon.  I think we need to get a scanner and then it would be quicker  although I guess you go through a lot more cartridges when you print out  pictures.  Steve has gone to B.C. for his competition this weekend.   He doesn't have any aspirations of winning but says at least he did it.  He  got down to 155 lbs.  so made light weight.  I'm hoping he goes back  to real food but stays in shape.  
 
How is the squash game going?  Has Beth beat  you yet?  Are you still golfing?  We are pretty well done with   the golf but curling started Thursday.  Both Dad and Robert were away so  Joanne and I and two spares managed to get a win.  Joanne skipped and I  played second.  By the way, Joanne thinks she is moving to Toronto with  work.  She said probably Nov. 1st.  I guess Mirant bought the last of  Trans Canada Pipeline and so she and some marketing guy will  set up  the Toronto office.  I read in the paper that this makes Mirant only  second to the U.S. giant,  Enron.  Meanwhile Mirant was moving  into Eau Clair this weekend as they need more space.
 
I'm sorry I rambled on.   If you get  me the right address for Beth, I'll bug her next time.  Love to both of you  and please keep safe.
 
Love Mum
