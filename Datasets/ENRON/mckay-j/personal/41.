You obviously forget the deafening tones of McMahon Stadium!!!!  Now that's
loud baby!!

Getting colder by the day up here....down into the low teens the last few
days, even had a bit of snow on the weekend.  Played hockey last night and
although it was my first time on skates in 6 months, I held up okay.  We
won 5-2.

Too bad about Notre Dame....I guess they're not the usual Irish powerhouse
this year?  Catch that Monday Nighter yesterday? (Skins/Cowboys).....didn't
think so......what a yawner.  Absolutely deplorable football.

Glad you didn't get me a Bagwell jersey, those bums couldn't do anything
against Brave pitching!  I just hope the Mariners come out of it all.....

I'm going home....more tomorrow.  We miss you too.....Scotty's not too big
on going to watch football.....
