monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven
minutes.
>
>32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend"
>have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that your feeling weird and
guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a
big mistake it was.
>
