I've just sent the application for Jon McKay's Canadian Pension Plan / U.S. Social Security agreement whereby he will pay us his CPP and not have any S.S. withheld while working in the U.S.    His application is for the period August 22, 2001 to September 1, 2006 and will not be renewable after that date unless the 5-year limit is changed.

Normally the approval takes 4 weeks and I'll notify you (and send you a copy of the approval letter) so you can stop his S.S. deductions.

Many thanks,
