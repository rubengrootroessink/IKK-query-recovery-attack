Quite often we ask ourselves hard to answer questions,
like, "What is a sonofabitch? "

And we wax philosophic with metaphysical postulations,
incomplete aphorisms and inconsistent sophism that make
one more and more sure that the only true thing is that a
picture is worth a thousand words.

In the attached photo, the guy on the right is a member
of a bomb squad in midst  of  a deactivation. The guy behind
him, well, he's a sonofabitch.
