Gentlemen:

I'm going to be in Houston for meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
Unfortunately, I have client dinners on both Tuesday and Wednesday evening,
but could still meet up for a drink afterwards, about 9pm somewhere.
Hopefully, this can work for you guys, as I'd like to catch up.

Please give me a call today at work, or else on my cell tomorrow.

Cheers,

Alan Wright
