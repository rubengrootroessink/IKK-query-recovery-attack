Dear Jonathan:

Thank you for contacting Audi of America.  As there are few differences
between U.S. and Canadian models, moving between the two countries is
generally easy.  However, you should obtain a letter of compliance; this is
a statement by the manufacturer or importer that the vehicle conforms to the
destination country's standards.

You may request this letter from our Corporate Headquarters at the following
address:

Audi of America
Corporate Headquarters
3800 Hamlin Road
Auburn Hills, MI 48326

If we can be of any further help please write again.

Comments  : Dear Audi,

I have an A4 I wish to move from
Calgary, Canada to Houston, TX.  Other
than changing the instrument panel, do
you know of any other modifications
needed to do to import this car.  Also,
would you know which government agency
in the USA I need to contact to make
sure there is no problems bringing my
1998 Audi A4.

I have very much enjoyed my A4 and hope
to continue driving my Audi and future
Audi products when I arrive in Houston.

Any information or insight would be
greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,

Jon
