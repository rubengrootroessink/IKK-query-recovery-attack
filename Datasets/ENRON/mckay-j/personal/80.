Yet again, I anticipated having a letter to email out tonight.  I'm almost there and just have to consult w/one other person to ensure we have everything in it we need for a smooth transition.  I believe I will accomplish that early tomorrow morning and will email it to you both and follow-up w/ a hard copy to you John.
