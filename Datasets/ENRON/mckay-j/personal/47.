I have noticed that there is still a sizeable chunk of change in my bank
account.  Did you get the check?

How are you settling into things down there?  Stuff was pretty crazy around
here last week.  They cancelled classes on Tuesday and delayed them on Wed.
We also had many vigils and moments of silence.  A couple of my friends here
were directly impacted, in addition to one of my profs.  Not good.  Kind of
makes you feel like moving back to Canada.  Other than that, we have started
to learn some pretty cool things in our organizational behavior class, and
sharpened up our excel skills in a decision sciences class.  School is fun.
