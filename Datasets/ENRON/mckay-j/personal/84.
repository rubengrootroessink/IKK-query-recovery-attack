Jon

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I talked
to your mom last night and we talked about the stuff
you have that is mine.  She was going to call you but
if she did not reach you here goes.

I paid either $1,600.00 or $1,700.00 for the three
piece unit.  I really do not care what you sell them
for just get rid of them the best you can.  Sell cheep
and get them out of your way.

Carol will look after the dolls and she will also keep
the mirror for me as she has the table.  She told me
that the mirror is broken but she will keep the frame
for me which is great.

How are things going.  Have you had people in to look
at the house yet?  Keep me posted.  Oh yes, when you
move back to Houston can I still reach you at this
e-mail address?  If not make sure to drop me a line
with a new address so we can keep in touch.

Is this going to be another promotion for you or is it
a lateril transfer?  Whatever, I wish you luck.

Won't keep you any longer as it is late and past my
bedtime.  Talk to you later.

Donna
