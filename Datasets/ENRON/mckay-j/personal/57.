I would love to do closer to 15000, but 10 will definately work.  I have
about 14000 in tuition bills due in several weeks, and need to definately
convert some money.  Why don't you choose a rate, and e-mail me the rate and
your address (work is probably best, although I don't believe I have any
cards here and will need the address again!).  I will rush you a check,
which you can cash and then rush me back a check.

I really appreciate your help, and will hopefully talk to you soon (we will
have to talk one of these afternoons, as I am generally around and have no
classes!).

How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right
away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would
be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other
or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to
do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.

Let me know what you want to do.

Jon
