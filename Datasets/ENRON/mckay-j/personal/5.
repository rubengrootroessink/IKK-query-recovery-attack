I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2
resumes
that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives
knowledge and industry experience.  She has
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination
opportunities also.

Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.
