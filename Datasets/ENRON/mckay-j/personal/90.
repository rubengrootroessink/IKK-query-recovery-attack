FOLLOW-UP NOTICE

Dear Mr. McKay:

Thank you for your interest in the Association for Investment Management and
Research (AIMR).  On your Level III Enrollment /AIMR & Society / Chapter
Membership Form you indicated that you wished to apply for AIMR membership
after passing Level III.  Now that the 2001 exam is over, AIMR invites you
to take this opportunity to activate your membership application.

Although the results of the Level III exam are not currently available, we
encourage you to complete your membership application today to avoid any
delays in the eventual award of the CFA charter upon successful completion
of Level III.

Please note that one of the requirements to be awarded the CFA charter is to
fulfill AIMR membership requirements and apply concurrently for membership
in AIMR and in an AIMR member society or chapter (if a society or chapter is
located less than 50 miles (80 km) of a candidate's place of business).  If
you work more than 50 miles (80 km) from an AIMR member society or chapter,
please notify us in writing if you would like to receive an exemption.  The
award of the CFA charter is contingent upon completion of all requirements.


To complete the processing of your membership application we need your
society preference and appropriate sponsor forms. All application materials
are valid for one year.  Please review all sponsor requirements on AIMR's
website at http://www.aimr.org/memservices/join/requirements.asp


All sponsor forms and related materials can be downloaded from AIMR's
website at http://www.aimr.org/memservices/join/apply.asp or you may call to
request these forms.

Please contact AIMR's Information Central department at tel: 800-247-8132 or
804-951-5499, fax: 804-951-5290, or e-mail: membership@aimr.org if you have
any questions regarding the status of your membership request.


Sincerely,

Candidate & Member Services
