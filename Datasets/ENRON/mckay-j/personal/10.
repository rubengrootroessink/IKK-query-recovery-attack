Dear Sir,

My name is Jonathan McKay and I am contacting you with regards to The Houston Society of Financial Analysts.  I have just recently move to Houston from Calgary, Canada and now find myself in need of sponsorship.  Just this past year I also completed the third exam and sponsorship will allow me to become a charter holder.  I obtained your name from a list of people that may be willing to sponsor new members and would greatly appreciate any help you could offer.

In order for you to become comfortable sponsoring me I have attached my resume and would also be willing to meet with you in person if that is preferable.  Also, attached is a copy of the sponsors document that contains a section that needs to be completed by my sponsor.  If you would be willing to sponsor me I would be very grateful, and if you are unable to sponsor me at this time any help you could offer as far as contacting other local members would be equally appreciated.

Thank you for your help.


Jon McKay
