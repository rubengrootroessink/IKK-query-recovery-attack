Jon, I though I would check in and see how things are going down south.  I
talked to the boys in Calgary last week about the PSAC report, I guess that
they were going to the luncheon last week and wondering if they should anti
up the money for the report.  Other than that, I haven't talked to them
much, but can't wait to get home for Christmas.

Things have been pretty busy up here, I have spent a lot of time partying,
but even more time studying and working.  We have finals next week, then
have a week off, and start up again.  So far, things have gone pretty well,
and I have learned some pretty neat things (why Napster was an efficient
solution, why Microsoft included I.E. in their operating system...).  We are
finishing the accounting (thank goodness), and will be starting into capital
markets and more spreadsheet classes.  All in all, we have covered a lot of
the material that was in the first year of the CFA, but also learned a
little more about the softer subjects and case analysis.

The social scene here is pretty good, other than a definite lack of women.
Our class had one of the lowest female participant rates in history, and it
is starting to show on the faces of many of the single guys in my class
(myself included).  Four of us took a run up to Montreal on Friday for the
night, and it was a welcome relief.  Other than that, we can't complain too
much.  I started to play hockey once a week, and bought a ski pass that I
should be able to use in a few more weeks.

I am starting to think about what I am going to do next summer, and wanted
to talk to you about a few things.  I was considering a brief foray into the
consulting industry, and was thinking about a company in Boston that
specializes in the natural gas and power markets.  They have a pretty good
staff, and are very technical in terms of project valuations, and analysis.
I think that it would be a good, different background, but wanted to talk to
you (and possibly your girlfriend), about other types of work or companies
within the industry, including Enron.

Let me know when you get time to talk, and also let me know how things are
going in Houston.

Later.
