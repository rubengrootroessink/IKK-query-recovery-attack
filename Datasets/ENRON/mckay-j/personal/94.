John:

I did some investigating on the Canadian homesale piece and found out some
interesting facts.  First one and the most important one is that I will not
be handling that piece of the relocation.  Instead a young woman by the name
of Severine Jennings will be handling that our of our International
Department and her number is 800/241-6529 ext. 75910.  She specializes in
Canadian properties and will be the better person to assist you.
Secondly, there is a real need for you to use Royal LePage as the agency to
list your home and the reason is that they know everything there is to know
about the favorable tax treatment on sale of your home.  They know how to
handle the sale in the "U.S. way" and they follow all the strict guidelines
of relocation.  Severine will contact you to go over all this with you
tomorrow.

I will still be your contact for all othe aspects of your relocation.
Remember, Billie will call you tomorrow to get you wiring information for
your lump sum calculations.

Talk to you on Monday - have a great weekend.
