Hey Jonny, what's up?  Jeez, just heard about the bombings, how is that
affecting you guys?  Let me know what's going on....

Scotty told me about your house being sold....that's great.  I think I'm
going over with him tonight to start clearing out some stuff...I'll grab
the plants and the light like we discussed....Scott may store the poker
table for me.  Let me know if there's anything else you need us to do...

Hope everything's okay down there...
