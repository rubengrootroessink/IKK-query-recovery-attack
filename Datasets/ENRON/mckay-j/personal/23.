Hi Jonathan, 
A couple of questions for you: 
1) Have you proceeded with opening an account at Dane Rauscher yet? 
2) Your RSP account has a small debit of $50.00, probably due to RSP holding fees charged to the account for 2001.  We either need a cheque from you for the $50.00 or we need to sell $50.00 worth of something to generate the $50.00 in the account.
Just drop me a note or call regarding how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.
