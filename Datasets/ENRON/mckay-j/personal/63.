Jonny how's it going?  Just wondering how the living arrangements are so
far?  I'm sure it's all still very blissful being as it's only been 3 days.
Hopefully you guys are doing okay!

Wasn't sure if your email address changed or not....get back to me when you
have a minute, let me know what's happening!

Glen
