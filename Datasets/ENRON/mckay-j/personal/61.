Jon, I have finally gotten my computer, and started our first day of orientation down here, things are going really well!

I was looking to get around 20000 worth of US$ sometime soon (things haven't seemed to be going the proper direction recently).   As far as I can tell, the bank is charging me around 200 - 250 points to convert my cash, anything less would be desirable!

If you don't have that much, I am willing to take whatever you have!

Thanks
