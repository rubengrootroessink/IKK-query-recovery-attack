Hi
Thanks for the note.  It was great to hear from you and to know that all of the BS down there is not really effecting you and your fun.
My new address is:   Donna Ackert,  21 McPherson Road, WHITEHORSE, Y.T. Y1A 5S3.  Phone #(867) 456-2154.
You do not have to worrie about sending me a cheque.  It is not a big deal.  Just take yourselves out for a nice dinner or whatever and have a drink for me while your at it.  I just appreciate you looking after my Daultons for me while you could.
Work is coming along.  We are in the process of putting product on the shelves.  What a mess everything is in.  We have 24 days before opening and if we make it I will be surprised.  Lack of any sence of organization is a big problem.  All I can say is, I am glad that I am just a flunkie because if I owned the place Heads would roll.
The old bod keeps forgetting that it is six years older than it was in Summerland and just can't figure out why it is so pooped at the end of the day.  I really don't know how I managed 7 days a week, for weeks on end.  GETTING OLD IS NO FUN AT ALL.
Well best get for now.  Love to both you and Beth.
Donna
