Hi Jon

Just read your message.  Sounds like you are going to
be very busy for the next while.  Your house will
probably sell very fast as it is in a great area and
it is a nice place.

You can just sell the cabinets of mine if you want.  I
don't have room for them and neither does your mum or
if you want just take them with you if you want them.
I just dropped a note to your mum to ask her to keep
the mirror for me as she has the table and I am sure
she will keep the Daultons if you do not want to take
them with you.  I know you may not as they are a pain
in the but to haul arround with you.

If you talk to Steve and he wants the TV cabinte he is
welcome to have it, but if he can not use if again
just sell it when you start selling off your stuff.

My new phone is (867) 456-2154.  I am going away
tomorrow morning and will be gone until Sunday
evening.  Ron's mum is here and I am taking her on a
little tour.

Anyway we can talk about this more next week if that
is ok with you.  Drop me a note and let me know.

Lots of Love

Donna
