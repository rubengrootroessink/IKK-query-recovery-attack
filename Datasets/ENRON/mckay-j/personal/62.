Sung to American Pie

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price
used
to
make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened
to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but
February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in the
Boardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read
about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside,
the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.
Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff
above,
if
the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can
mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears.
He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I
was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the
dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George
and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and
while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit
had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought
it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling
will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We
started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space
with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff
S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh
and
as
I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO
cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success
is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and
Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I
had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.
