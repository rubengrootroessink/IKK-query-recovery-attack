		Are you drowning in PEP??!
				Need a helping hand?

Rumour has it that the PEP deadline has been extended to at least Monday, May 28th!  The PEP team in Houston will be sending out a formal announcement later today. 

A couple of reminders:
Supervisors - don't forget to "approve" your employee lists of reviewers!
Everyone - make sure you list your accomplishments in your self-evaluation as they will be viewed by PRC meeting participants

Contact Human Resources if you have any questions.
