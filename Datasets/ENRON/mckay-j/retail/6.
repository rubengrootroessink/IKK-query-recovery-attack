Jon,  Thanks for everything.  There was a small error in the buy sheet for haul - all yesterday.  I have attached a correct one.  the problem was the final buy numbers did not divide by the days in the month evenly.  the total is out 11 GJs.  Just let me know what to do.  sorry!  Also, for February on a long term contract covering a leap year, do we need to incorporate a different formula to buy for that leap month with 29 days.
