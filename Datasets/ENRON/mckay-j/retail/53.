Jon,

I am going into a meeting with the Calgary and Area Managers Ass. and I would like to give them current pricing for today.  Could you reprice Family Leisure/Huntington/Springbank/Calgary Soccer/NE Sportsplex and the typical load shape of the rate 11 sites which is listed on its own tab.  Could you also let me know what your feel is in regards to the movement of these prices between today and Monday / Tuesday of next week - Start Date August 1 2001

1/2/3/5 Year Options

Thanks
Greg
