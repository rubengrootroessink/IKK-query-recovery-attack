Jon,
 
I'm not going to be in tomorrow and Kate Joslyn is going to close the Lindsay Park deal for me.  Could you Email pricing to her directly instead of to me.  Thanks Jon.
 
Hey, if you ever need some tickets to go to a game let me know.
 
Greg

We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.
 
Regards,
 
Jon

Jon,
 
Lindsay Park is being a pain in the butt - could you update me on price.  I know we are up today - when do you think prices may get back down to 4.25 range again?
 
Start Date - August 1 
 
Thanks
