Hey Jon,

Can you give me 1, 2, 3, 5 yrs out of Nov 1/01 for SMED (profile attached)? They are pretty keen to deal, but they haven't yet given me their financials. There is potential for us to straighten everything out today. Realizing you always give me tight pricing, can you give me your best here? They want to deal with us as we order furniture from them, but are squeezing us a little saying there is another competitor who is better than us. I have tightened our margins to $0.15/GJ which is small in the retail market even for this size of account.

Thanks, Mark.
