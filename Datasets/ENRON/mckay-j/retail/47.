John, my understanding of our deal with you to sell 51 GJ's of gas to you each day until the end of June was at the AECO daily price with no discount. The Schedule A for Sitara 838545 shows a discount of $0.06835 per GJ. If this should be 0 can you let  me and Lisa McIsaac know so the contract can be changed, if not can you contact Kate or myself when you have a break in trading or after trading has closed for the day.

Thanks
