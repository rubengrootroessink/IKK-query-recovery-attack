Jon
We would like to reduce Boardwalk's AECO Daily priced volume by the following GJ/month.
For June please reduce the position equally by the number of days remaining in the month.
Please advise us of any costs associated with this transaction.  How we deal with the remaining portion of the volume is dependent on 
final resolution with Boardwalk.
Many thanks
Kate
