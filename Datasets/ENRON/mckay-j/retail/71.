Jon, per our discussion this morning.

The names of the folks on the Wholesale Gas side in Enron U.K. who would be knowledgeable of how load following deals are handled:

Dave Redmond
Peter Crilly

Other comments from Charlie Crossley/Cooke

* they continue to do large numbers of load following power deals each week
* in the U.K. - Louise Kitchen was the 'architect' of putting the process in place to manage the risk associated with natural gas load following deals
* they have 8 load profiles in the U.K. (all customers would be classified into one of these 8 load profiles) -  these 8 profiles are used to put their hedges in place.

Please keep us plugged in as to your progress, it goes without saying that resolving this problem is of prime importance to Enron Direct.

Darren
