Is this model based on HDD?  Will it be appropriate for the Canadian Climate?  Scott is still waiting on the vacancy rates for Calgary, we will forward it as soon as we can.  Please let us know if there is any further information that you need.
Thanks for your help.
Kate

I'm waiting on an approved model form Houston that incorporates the correlation between price and an consumption.  It is suppose to show up anytime now.  
This information should help us manage these correlation between these risks.

Thanks,

Jon
