The transfer of your securities and mutual funds is in process.  There
are a few Canadian items that will not transfer.  You mentioned that you
would like to sell the Canadian securities and transfer the cash.  Can
you please call Dale Onrait at 250-712-2195 and have him liquidate the
Canadian positions and tell him you would like the proceeds and the
Candian cash to be converted to US dollars and transfered to RBC Dain
Rauscher.  This instruction must come from you.  If you have any
questions, please give me a call.
