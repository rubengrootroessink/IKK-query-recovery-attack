Jon, how are things going these days?  Are you going to stay in Houston?
Did you get a job with UBS?  How is the job search going for your
girlfriend?

So many questions...

Things have been going okay up here, other than the fact that we have to
look for summer jobs.  Christmas holidays back home were definitely fun, but
I missed talking to you.  I went back to visit the office a couple of times,
and Lambie and I managed to get out for an afternoon sporting clays shoot
and a couple of beers.

Since getting back here, I have had the opportunity to go skiing and play
hockey a number of times.  Classes are okay, but could be a lot better.  We
are currently taking marketing, strategy and corporate finance.  The corp
fin course is cool, and we learned a little bit about real options and
valuing debt and equity using black-scholes modeling.  That stuff if pretty
interesting, and I think that I am going to try and get a summer job doing
corp fin with a company.  We have a big hockey tournament here this weekend
which should prove to be fun, and the olympics also start.  I can't wait to
watch the Canadians kick a little Yankee ass at hockey.  I have also planned
a trip to Costa Rica for a couple of weeks in March, where I will hopefully
spend a little time on the beach and meet a couple of sweet latin american
girls.

Anyway, hopefully all is well down there for you.  I am interested in
hearing how things are going for you.

Take Care.

Jeff
