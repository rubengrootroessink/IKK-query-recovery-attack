Re:	Major 2002 Construction Projects

The projects listed below are the major pipeline and station 
construction projects that are currently scheduled for the 2002 
construction season.  Dates and duration of these jobs may change prior 
to construction.  Additional information will be forthcoming on a 
particular job if there are significant impacts to available capacity.

Unless specifically stated to the contrary, the following jobs will not 
impact firm transportation.  However, based on past summer operating 
conditions, it is anticipated that interruptible transportation 
services (IT and secondary FT) may be impacted by some of the work.  
The extent of the impact will depend on operating conditions at the 
time of the outages.
