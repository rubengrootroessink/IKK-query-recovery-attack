Hi Jon,
 
I just got an answer from the resort......they are  quoting a
rate of 73.00 US per night. That would be your cost  to share
the room and have the same all inclusive  features.
You would pay this amount locally.
 
I am still waiting to hear from the tour company  that I booked the other guys through.  I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks,
Debby
