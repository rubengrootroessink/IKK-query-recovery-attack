Randy,

Could you please prepare a credit sheet for a master physical contract between ECC and Cinergy Canada Inc.  Cinergy Canada Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cinergy Marketing and Trade.  Your contact person is David Livingston at p(713) 393 - 6852, f(713) 890 - 3122.

Also, could you please give me credit clearance for Cinergy Canada to trade shorter term products on Enrononline under our GTC.

Regards,

Jon
