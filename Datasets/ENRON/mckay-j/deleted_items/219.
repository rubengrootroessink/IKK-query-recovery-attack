Hi Jon,

Thinking of you and thought I'd try out your new e-mail address.  Hope you are having a good day.It snowed again last night, but is suppose to warm up a bit today. Dad got home late last night from Vancouver.  He said it was very nice there.

I forgot to tell you and Beth last time we talked that the pointsettia you gave Dad when he was in hospital at Christmas is still doing well,  The other ones I had are long gone.  Just thought you should know that it probably pays to spend the buck on them as it must mean they are better cared for during growth.  Also, did you ever call Grandpa and what did he have to say?  I talked to him briefly last night but didn't want to ask if you had talked to him in case you hadn't.  He asked about you though and was of course pleased to hear you were working.  He has a very sore throat so I didn't talk very long.

Okay I don't want to take up too much of your time.  Love you.

Mum
