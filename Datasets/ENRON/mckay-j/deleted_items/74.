I assumed that all was well. Beth said you had a blister. I told her  to tell
you how to treat it hoepfully she passed that on to you. At week 8, if you
would be will to consider it, That would be a good week for a 5k race. Just a
test race. Give me a call some evening if you have any questions. Saturday
evening works best for me. My wife works at a radio station from 5-12 on
Saturday evenings.
