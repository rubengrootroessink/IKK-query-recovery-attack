Our Lotus Notes based exception time system is not working due to some Outlook migration issues.   Human Resources, IT Calgary and IT in Houston are working to resolve the problems as quickly as possible.

Until the system is reprogrammed, please seek exception time approval from your supervisor and record your time manually.   An update will be sent when the system is functioning properly and is ready to use.

Thank you for your patience.
