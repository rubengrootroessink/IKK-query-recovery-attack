Hi Chris,  

Tonight we are rolling out a new report.  Currently, only you and Jon have access to it.  You'll select it off the main reports menu.  It will say "NGX Download report".  When you launch it, it will show the data on screen like all other reports.  There is a button at the bottom that says "Export".  Clicking it will give you several selections.  Choose the one that says "Save to NGX XML".  You can then save it as a file which can be mailed to NGX.  

Let me know if there is anyone else who needs access.

Thanks!
