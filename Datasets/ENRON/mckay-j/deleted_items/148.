HI Jon,

The IT guys do not know when we can begin scraping Tetco and Algonquin/Mar data today, but the moment it comes out I'll get the map down to you.  I don't quite understand the problem, but when we switched to a new server we lost some access rights that we originally had to dukes website.

I'll keep you updated.
