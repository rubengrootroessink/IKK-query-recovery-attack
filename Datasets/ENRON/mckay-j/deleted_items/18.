Hi Jon,
 
Sorry to take so long getting back to you. I have  asked the tour company what the cost would be to have you in the
room with the others, plus I have emailed the hotel  to see
what they would charge if you just paid it  locally.
 
So, far I have heard from neither. The tour company  did
say it could take a few days to find out whether or  not they could do it.
Because the most likely way for you to get there  will be
with American Airlines, I checked with their tour  desk and
they did offer the same hotel but didnt have any  space left.
All I can tell you at this point is that your  airfare with American Airlines will be around 700.00 US. In  the
meantime, you might try calling a travel agency  down there
to see what the best rate is they can find on a  flight for you
from Feb 15 - 19. They might have differnet fares  that arent
available from here.
I will keep you posted on the hotel.
ps...which one of the guys do you know  
Talk to you soon,
Debby
