Hi Jon,

I spoke with Russel and this is what he said:

-Enron Canada Corp. will be posting the letter of credit
-the cost will be 75-100bp's per amount of LC ie.  $1,000,000 =$7,500-$1,000
-the cost will be associated with the particular business group-most likely Enron Canada
-NGX will provide updates and so will Russel regarding the $30 MM credit
-We will have to be actively requesting our position
-Russel said he will be able to run real time data in a crunch situation but typically we can expect a one day lag

Russel also mentioned that he is going to contact NGX's credit group so they can attempt tp mimic NGX's format the best that they can.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Ian
