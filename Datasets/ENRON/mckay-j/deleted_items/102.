Hi Jon,

I have a username and password for Dan to use.  I just left him a message to call me to get them.  Additionally, I'll verify that he's comfortable with the specs when he calls.

Jay,

Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.

Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.


Regards,

Jon
