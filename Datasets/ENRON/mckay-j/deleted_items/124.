Hi Lucy, << File: LO Requirements.xls >> 

Jon Mckay asked me to send you the attached data.  I have included Data going back until November of 1993 in case you wanted to go back past five years.  
The attachment includes:
-AECO CAD historicals
-AECO US historicals(simply using the foreign exchange rate conversion)
-the corresponding foreign exchange rates
-the Henry Hub (USD)
-the basis

Hope this helps, please let me know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Ian Cooke
