Attached please find the most recent versions of ENA's weekly Management Summary Reports for your review.  These reports will be distributed to each of you on a go-forward basis.  It is important that items on ENA's reports such as Margin, Expenses, Capital Charges and Deals Completed tie-out to our ECC reports as this is what we are evaluated on.  To this end, Grant Patterson has been and will continue to attempt/ensure that the ENA reports are accurate.  If you have questions or concerns regarding the attached reports please see Grant or myself.

By cc to Grant, the margin numbers for the 2nd quarter and, more importantly, YTD, continue to be inaccurately reported.

Regards, Rob
