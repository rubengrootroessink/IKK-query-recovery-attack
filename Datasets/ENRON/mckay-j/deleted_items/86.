Spoke to Dan at NGX today.  He said the external interface document looked fine and he had no questions or concerns.  He had no idea what you might be waiting for turn around on.  Feel free to give him a call if you need anything further.  

If there is anything else I can do to help speed things along just let me know.

We are having some trouble getting NGX to return our phone calls regarding some technical documents we sent over there. Could you call them and let them know we need a turn around asap to make our deadline.

thanks,
Andy
