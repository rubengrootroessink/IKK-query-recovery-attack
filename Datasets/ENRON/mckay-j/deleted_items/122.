Jon, 
I am wondering if you can have someone at your office send over the information for July near month so that we can complete a test run before we go live with the pie chart in August.  This will also allow us to see what kind of percentages to expect, the kind of information we will get, etc.  This will allow us to troubleshoot the process as well. If this is a problem please let me know at the number listed below.  
Also, within the next week or so I will let you know who to forward the information to on a monthly basis beginning on the last business day of July.
Regards,
