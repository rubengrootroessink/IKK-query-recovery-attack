Ian, 
I have not been able to get ahold of Jon McKay and have heard through the grapevine that he has gone to Houston with Enron.  Therefore, I am contacting you to try to get some information necessary for the assembly of the month end pie chart.  I am wondering if Jonathan has designated responsibility for getting the information to us on the last business day of every month.  Also, I would like to get the July near month information to do a test run.  If possible please forward me this information or let me know who to contact to get the necessary information.
Thanks,
