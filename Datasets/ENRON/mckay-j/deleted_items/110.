Peter,

We need to provide wording to the auditors regarding the following:
1.	Notification wrt "Trades in Error" - Article 6.2
2.	Alternate data delivery procedures.

We have agreed to notify NGX verbally of any "Trades in Error" in a timely fashion.  Upon notification we would defer to Article 6.2 of the Alberta Price Index Methodology document.  NGX would take care of notifying industry participants and removing the trade from the indices.

With respect to alternate data delivery, we have agreed to provide the data electronically at least hourly.  The data will be provided to NGX in the XML format outlined in the interface document.

Would you please write up a couple paragraphs that outline our obligations.  If you have any questions please contact Mckay or myself.  TKS.

Lambie
