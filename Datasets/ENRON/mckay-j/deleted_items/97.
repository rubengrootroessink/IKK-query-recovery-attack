Jon,
As discussed, here is a reminder of the agreement we reached prior to my move back to Calgary. Rob Milnthorp offered me $10,000 as a moving compensation. I would appreciate if you could get in touch with the HR department to make the steps necessary for that amount to be processed. 

Again, thank you for your help and support.

Stephane
