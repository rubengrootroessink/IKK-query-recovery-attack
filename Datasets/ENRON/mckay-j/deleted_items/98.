D&T are the auditors appointed under our NGX settlement to stream EOL data into the NGX/CGPR Alberta indices.  D&T has signed a confidentiality agreement and, by the terms of the settlement, not only is it ok to provide counterparty names to D&T it is required.  D&T is however prohibited from disclosing counterparty information to anyone, including NGX.
