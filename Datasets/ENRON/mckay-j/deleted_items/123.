Hi Jon,
I guess it isn't critical that we see whether the  trades are a buy or a sell.  The reason that I had requested this was to  ensure that I has both sides of the trade but in your case you may be long or  short depending on the circumstance.  Therefore, if you could just include  the Enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by  Enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts.  I understand your  concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if  there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie  chart. 
Unfortunately, I am not in the office on Monday or Tuesday  so will not be able to reach you.  If you have any further concerns please  call me on Wednesday to discuss.
