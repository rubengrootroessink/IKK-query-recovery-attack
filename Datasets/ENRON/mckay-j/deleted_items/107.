HI Guys, 
Thanks for the Data files you sent, if I have any other questions, I will contact you guys today sometime this afternoon. 
Jonathan, Graham and myself were talking to NGX and they said that they almost always have contracts that have "Firm Performance Obligations" and that are non-interruptible.  Is that the same for Enron as well?  And I just wanted to confirm that I will be receiving the policies and procedures for how trades-in-error and breakdowns in communication are dealt with, sometime this afternoon.
Thankyou,
