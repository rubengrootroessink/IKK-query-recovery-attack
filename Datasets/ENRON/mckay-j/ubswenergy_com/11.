Jon, can I use you as a reference for an interview that I have on Friday?
The company that I am interviewing with was here for first rounds last week,
and I made it to the second round.  If I get the job, I think I will
probably land myself in Houston for the summer!  Interviews should be pretty
neat on Friday, the first guy that is interviewing me is has a PhD in
Physics from MIT, and the second girl has a couple of Masters degrees from
Harvard.  They may be tough.

If you don't mind, can you give me your contact info (company, address,
phone #) to provide to them?

I hope that things are going well with your trading this week.
