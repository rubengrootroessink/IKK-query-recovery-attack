Please forward to me everyone's logon ID.  I will get website access set up for traders to simulate VAR on positions.  This tool will be useful for learning how much risk/VAR a trade has in it (basis last nights curves) prior to executing.  Class to follow shortly.

Feel free to distribute this email to anyone I may have forgotten.
Thanks,
Frank
