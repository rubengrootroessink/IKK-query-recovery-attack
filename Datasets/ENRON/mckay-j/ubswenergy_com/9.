Please see the attached Press Release regarding today's launch of UBSWenergy.com. Also attached is Friday's Press Release regarding the completion of the transaction with Enron. This release was distributed to all UBS Warburg Energy employees Friday afternoon, but it was apparently deleted from some employees' files during the migration process.
