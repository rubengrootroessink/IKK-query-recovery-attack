Attention UBSWE Outlook Users:

As outlined in the previous migration documentation, your mail file has been replaced with a blank mail box.  The messaging team is currently working to import previous contacts, calendar events, journals, tasks and notes.  In addition, your email address has been changed from first.last@enron.com to first.last@ubswenergy.com.  Any mail sent to you at an @enron address will be sent back to the sender via an auto reply stating that your address has changed and they will need to resend to your first.last@ubswenergy.com address.  If you still have your previous Enron email in your mail file, please alert the messaging team by opening a ticket with the resolution center by calling 3-1411.  

Thanks for your cooperation and support through this email migration!
