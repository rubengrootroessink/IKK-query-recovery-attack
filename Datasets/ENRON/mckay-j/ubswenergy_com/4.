Curves are located at O:/Dropbox/UBS Curves/East/...


I have saved a file for each curve file under today's date. I took the curve files loaded Thursday and saved them as today, so they should have any trader updates. (Please check this) Remember their are four (4) curves currently;

EastBasis0211 - Sandra
MktBasis1102 - Jon
EastIntraGDP0211 - Chuck
MktEastIndexY0211 - ???
EastIndexY0211 - ???


Thanks.
