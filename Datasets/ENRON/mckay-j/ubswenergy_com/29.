After close of business on February 8th and through December 31, 2002, UBS is required to provide certain 'Transition Services'  as described in Article XI, section 11.3 of the comprehensive Licensing Agreement between Enron Corp and UBS AG.   Enron will provide a written task list of  certain services to be performed by UBSW Energy employees.  UBS shall provide the information technology management services, financial advisory services and any other services mutually agreed to, with respect to trading and risk management for the existing Enron trading book.  In order to ensure we are meeting these requirements, we will be asking Enron to funnel all requests through Eddy Daniels.   Eddy Daniels will be responsible for allocating resources for each request in consultation with the Department Heads.

Effective immediately, all employees already contacted by the Estate are required to keep a time sheet of hours spent on services performed on behalf of Enron.   The following information is required on the attached time sheet template:
 
Employee Name
Pay Period (Month)
Description of specific work activity performed by employee
Time spent on project/service in 1/4 hour increments
Out of pocket expenses incurred each day 

The time sheets will be used for purposes of billing Enron back for services rendered per section 11.5 of the agreement.   The following procedures are required for us to complete the billing and for purposes of maintaining the appropriate records needed for auditing purposes:

Submit completed time sheet to Anne Eastwood (ECS 05195)  
Attach original receipts to time sheet for expenses greater than $25.	

The time sheets should be completed and turned in the next business day after each pay period. If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas at ext. 35280 or Eddy at ext. 31440.   


 
Thanks,

Louise
