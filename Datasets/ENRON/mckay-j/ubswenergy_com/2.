Please find intial VAR allocations for our desk listed below.  Please note that I hopeful that these will increase over time (hopefully, weeks not years).  Also, we will need to constantly reevaluate how our VAR is allocated as new products come online.  If you have any concerns or would like to express your viewpoint
don't hesitate to yell at me or take me to a room.  Please view these VAR allocations as an initial allocation that will definately change.   

Neal 		600,000
Brawner 	500,000	
McKay		500,000
Ring		 50,000
Townsend	 50,000
Ames		 50,000


Thank you.

Scott
