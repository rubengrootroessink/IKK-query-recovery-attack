Guys,

As of this morning, these are the counterparties that are not trading with us:

BHP Billiton--no coal, yes vessels

Koch-generally no crude and products, but they have traded some small weather products.

Shell  (Stasco, Equiva)--no trades

Bank of Montreal--no trades  (started several weeks ago)

Phibro--appear to be no trades, but hard to confirm

BP--no trades.

Diamond Shamrock has a very small spread position on with us, and asked us to find someone to stand between.

Sempra is looking at their exposure to us in physical products, and asking questions about our docs.

ICE--The Majors have cut us off.
