FYI on budgets.
 
We almost have the total IT depreciation pulled together.
 
The systems development budget is moving down since our meeting.  We are meeting heavily with operations and the business unit heads or their designees to get those numbers down to what is necessary for 2002.
 
Got some agreement on headcount analysis form Wes today and will confirm with all other business units tomorrow so Jenny's budget will be accurate and the projected 2002 headcount accurate as well.
 
Richter is in tough spot trying to roll out the EOL pricing methodology to EA, EGM, EEL and EIM but he is doing the best he can.  The good news is that you know the total and they agree with the total.
 
Operations is almost agreed to.  Most business unit heads are close to their operations person (Bbo Hall, Brent Price, Kevin Sweeney, Beth Apollo) so they trust their budget recommendations.
 
Final complaint is, as expected, indirects but we are trying to get to yes on that.
 
When this is better in a few days, I will e-mail you a new sheet like the one we showed you that has new expenses, new capital and the TOTAL IT depreciation number.
 
Thanks.
