Hi Matthew,

Greg will be in the London office from early Tuesday afternoon through 
end-of-business day on Thursday, June 7.  Are you available to meet w/him for 
about an hour? He's available Tuesday afternoon until 5:00 p.m.  Wednesday 
there are a few slots available, and Thursday he is wide open.  Please 
advise.  If you could e-mail me your availability that would be great.  Also, 
Greg will be carrying mobile number +44 7901516638.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
