California Regulators Back Rate Increase For Utilities

* California regulators indicated yesterday that they are willing to
raise rates for electric utilities EIX and PCG,  following a review of their
finances
* Hearings to review utilities' financial status in hearings on Dec.
27 and 28
* KEY DATE:  January 4, when we expect they will vote to raise rates
* We see this action as positive for the utilities, because it reduces
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy, although further action is
required, in our view
* We also see it as positive for our Growth Energy companies.  Any
reduction in financial pressure on the utilities equates to reduced pressure
to re-regulate the wholesale power industry, in our view
* The results of the action were in line with our expectation; we
recommend investors buy the Growth Energy names on weakness.  In particular,
we highlight DYN, CPN, NRG, SOE and DUK.
