Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Energy Co-opportunity (ECO) and Capstone have entered into a
contractual relationship whereby ECO will be a preferred provider of and
will offer Capstone's 30kW microturbine unit to the electric cooperative
industry.  The contract also calls for the purchase of 76 units, which ECO
believes will sell rapidly given the interest indicated by its customers.
* Dublin, Ireland-based power developer Eirtricity is considering the
development of what would be the world's largest wind farm.  The 500 MW wind
farm would see a combination of land and offshore-based wind turbines,
likely in County Wicklow.
* Calpine c*Power, a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation, and AFS
Trinity have entered into a strategic partnership that will see Calpine
c*Power market AFS' flywheel products as a component of its Reliable Power
Systems that are designed to serve datacom ports.
