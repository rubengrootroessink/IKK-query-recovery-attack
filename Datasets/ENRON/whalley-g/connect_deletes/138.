Greg,
how are you?
Enclosed find some pictures from our regular sunday-night-Stammtisch.
Can you do me a favour and send me the email-adresses of James, Ben,
Glen, Mark and Ulrich. I want to invide them for the celebration of the
25th aniversary of the Stammtisch FKK. As you know this will happen from
20th of july until 22th of july 2001. I hope we see you there.
The email-adress on the top belongs to Hermann.
Servus
