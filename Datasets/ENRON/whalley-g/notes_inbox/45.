Thank you for your hospitality.  There were a couple of questions I had 
regarding our visit, some of which we left you with before our return to 
Washington.

I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding 
where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require 
customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage 
data regarding cookies?

Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices 
and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If 
yes, when?

In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the 
risk management groups?  How is the information used?

Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, 
in what form and for how long?

Thanks
