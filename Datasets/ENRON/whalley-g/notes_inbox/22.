Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational 
issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to 
take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing 
business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is 
whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?
