Jeff,

I enjoyed visiting with you, Lou, and Greg last week.
I haven't heard anything back, and so wanted to check
in to see if it's appropriate to schedule a follow up
phone call.  I am leaving for Europe on June 30 and
will be gone for 10 days, so hoped to hear something
before then.  Thanks.

Chad
