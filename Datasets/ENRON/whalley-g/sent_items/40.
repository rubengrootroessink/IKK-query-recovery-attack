Greg,
     A suggestion has been made that the EBS "Competitive Analysis" unit (4 people) be added on to my group, and that it continue to support EBS research/fundamentals needs.  I'm fine with this, but based on your comments earlier today (re: hesitation of integrating EBS into EWS), is this something I should embrace?

PS.  FYI, I'm working with Delainey to establish a Marketing Intelligence shop in EES.  I think we can help them fairly substantially, both with strategic marketing support and on the tactical deal level.  I've hired a guy who has worked for me in the past, Kevin Golden, to head up this effort and to begin to develop the necessary networks and infrastructure.  

PPS  In the meantime, folks are compiling the necessary information to examine the outsourcing to the technical group.  Several new projects seem to be materializing, which could be candidates for outsourcing:  gas storage/flows, refineries (operations and outages), and near-real time ship monitoring.
