Not a problem, I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Your assistant left a msg on Friday asking me to forward another copy of invoice.  I don't have electronic copy but can fax hard copy to you.  Plse advise fax number.

 
On the Vitol front, they just celebrated their 35th anniversary last weekend with a companywide outing in Spain.  I'm having lunch with some of the guys on Wednesday and will give you brief on latest sentiment on strategic front.  Neil.

Please respond to 
Hello Greg.  My accounting group in Boston has informed me that the $100k consulting invoice dated April 3 remains outstanding.  I'd appreciate your following up to find out status.  Thanks in advance.  Neil.
