I understand, but this is a difficult measure to build into a budget system, other than simply limiting the amount of capital you have available to meet your IBIT target.  We can't allow a dicision to cut IBIT by 90% and capital by 95% and call it a success.  The easiest way to control deployment of capital is thru a deal approval process.

My perception is that the Q4 and 2002 bugets are still only focused on IBIT.
I can easily make my numbers if I use a bunch of capital.  But how are we doing sending out the
additional messages to reduce capital deployed and to increase net income.  From this corner of
the world my perpsecptive is this needs more focus.  For all your free time....
