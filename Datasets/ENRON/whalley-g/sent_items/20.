got your message on cta.   it usually gets picked up in the analysis, but i guess tax usually does too.  this tax issue seemed to surprise everyone.  hopefully we can get a handle on the true impact of any sales soon.  \
by the way, i guess ken told someone today that we would make the numbers.  we need to be careful until we know what the numbers are.
 
are you around on wednesday?  we should talk about a few things.
