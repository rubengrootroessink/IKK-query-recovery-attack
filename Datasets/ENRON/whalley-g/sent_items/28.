Greg,  I am a cofounder of Inknowvator Inc.  I live in Houston, actually
Gene Humphrey and several other Enron folks are my neighbors.
Our new Idea Manager solution was selected by  Xcelerator to identify,
develop and select new ventures.  This was put on hold following the recent
management change.    The Knowledge Management group, then housed in EES,
had also recommended that we be brought in as an internal solution and as
an Enron corporate offering.

We are an ideal solution for Enron to identify and develop new business
ventures, to enhance current products and services,  and to share ideas and
learnings across the company.  Our solution is perfect for helping you
manage current organizational changes by engaging all employees to
understand issues and share ideas through innovation.  We can be up and
running in less than a month.  This could also be a great innovative story
for Wall Street.

The solution is being utilized by leading global companies in various ways
including:
1.  Strategic planning and new venture portfolio management
2.  New business, product, and service development
3.  Corporate innovation programs

We have now implemented or have reached agreement  to implement our
solution at various clients including:
   Schlumberger
   Halliburton
   ExxonMobil
   Johnson & Johnson
   IBM

Idea Manager is a unique decision software solution designed to capture and
utilize ideas, information and expertise that were here-to-fore relatively
inaccessible or unusable.  The solution encompasses the identification and
development of business opportunities and decision making in a leading edge
collaborative environment using portfolio management best practices.

I will call to schedule some time. I can give you a high level overview in
30 minutes.

Regards,

Ron
