I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up, but I think the agenda looks kond of soft.  At a minimum, I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3, risk management, and asset sales first.  I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow, cash flow, and our balance sheet.  If we don't get these things right, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Also, I notice that Cindy Olson and Beth Tilney are in attendance.  This should only be for presentation, as they are not members of the management committee.  It also seems a bit unusual to have Beth Tilney present for a discussion on company image and presentation, and not have Mark Palmer.
