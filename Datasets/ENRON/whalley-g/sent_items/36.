Greg Piper has asked for daily access to the DPR via the Executive Viewer.  In keeping with our policy of limited access to the data, I thought that it would be best to check with you on this request.  Greg appreciates our diligence in monitoring requests for access and understands that I am running this request by you.  Let me know what you would like for us to do.  Thanks.
