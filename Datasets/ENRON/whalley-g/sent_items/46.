We have got people all over these things that know them inside and out.  This is all about managing the downside
since it all has been monetized away.  I would love to give them away but can not see any value to the
corporation in doing it at this time.  Once they have the other assets in order it might make sense to 
reevaluate.

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?
