Mr Scrimshaw,

Thank you for your email to Leslie who is currently away.  Attached is the
list of participants to date although there are still invitations
outstanding.  The meeting is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in
Knightsbridge.

Please let me know if there is any further information you require at this
stage.

Regards.

Tessa Bohane
