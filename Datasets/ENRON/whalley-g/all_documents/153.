Enform expands Sun Micro partnership
HOUSTON, Dec. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Enform technology, a high-tech 
consultant, said it has expanded the company's strategic partnership with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. Privately held Enform said Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun 
Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator 
technology called iForce eIntegrators, for use in creating Web applications 
and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform 
build its service offerings and create custom consulting services, which will 
be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not 
clear, and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. 
Enform, which is run by John McNevin, a former partner at Ernst & Young, has 
grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps 
businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new 
technologies they need to remain competitive. Since its inception, Enform has 
apparently been profitable. It hasn't needed any venture capital to operate. 
The company has about 200 employees, with branch offices in Dallas and 
Austin, and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform 
recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in 
sales next year, if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft 
Corp., Engage Energy and Continental Airlines.
