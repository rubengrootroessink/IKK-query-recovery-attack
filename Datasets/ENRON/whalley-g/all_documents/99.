Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
 Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run=
=20
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North=20
America.

 So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a=
=20
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with =
a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower=01,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO =
is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the b=
est
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30=20
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene=20
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that presid=
ent
of BankAmerica=01,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and sm=
all=20
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
 Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
      Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in=
=20
detail:

 *  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is=
=20
the
heart of NewPower=01,s business plan?
 *  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
 *  How he=01,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a mi=
llion
by the end of 2001.
 *  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What=20
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
 *  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest=
=20
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated=
=20
retail
marketer in the US.
 *  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
 *  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
 *  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
 *  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
 *  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
 *  What=01,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
 *  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bi=
ll,
what kind of margin can it make now?
 *  How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We=01,re actually in a very good=
=20
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... "
 *  "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a=
=20
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in=
=20
the
industry by several orders of magnitude."

We=01,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading=
=20
company
in our industry is going to get there and stay there.
