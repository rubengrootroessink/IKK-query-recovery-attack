______________________________________________

Greetings Friends,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with 
Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court, and Governor 
Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that state's 25 electoral votes.  It is 
now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of incorporation for the 
Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As 
past transition foundations have done, we are applying for 501(c)(4) status 
from the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as our 
team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short 
period between now and inauguration day, January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in 1988, 
specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it also makes 
provisions for raising contributions from private sources to help defray 
transition-related expenses.  This has been done previously, most recently in 
1992.  We are now soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  
Would you please visit our new transition website at 
www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our secure server.

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from individuals.  No 
corporate or political action committee contributions will be accepted.  
Contributions may not exceed $5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all 
contributors, in compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure 
of financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website on a 
real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against an individual's 
annual political contribution federal giving limit of $25,000.

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to establish a 
government that will unify our country and make the common principles we 
share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's finance 
office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries should be directed to 
our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900. Your support of the Bush/Cheney 
Presidential Transition Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,


Donald L. Evans

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia

"One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely 
whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a 
reasonable interpretation of Florida law, 'legally cast vote[s].'  The 
counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten 
irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon 
what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.  Count first, and rule 
upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that 
have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."

"Another issue in this case, moreover, is the propriety, indeed the 
constitutionality, of letting the standard for determination of voters' 
intent- dimpled chad, hanging chads, etc.- vary from county to county, as the 
Florida Supreme court opinion, as interpreted by the Circuit Court, permits.  
If petitioner [Bush] is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful, 
permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an 
accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later, since it is 
generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the 
ballots, which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate."

Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T. Wells


DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand scrutiny which 
will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."
Excerpt:
"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not 
question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the 
majority. However, I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to 
reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process. I also believe 
that the majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will 
certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no foundation 
in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at anytime until 
the issuance of this opinion. The majority returns the case to the circuit 
court for this partial recount of  under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at 
best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others, the 
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally unknown. 
That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority 
creates."

"This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over 
continued judicial process. I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos, a 
professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, "[t]he 
margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, 
no matter who wins." Further judicial process will not change this 
self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder. Justice 
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action 
sixty-four years ago. I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls."
