Acta Announces Partnership With i2; i2 Customers Can Now Choose Acta's 
Rapid-to-Implement Data Integration Products to Collaborate Intelligently 
Across the Supply Chain

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 11, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, today announced a 
technology partnership with i2 Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITWO), the leading 
provider of marketplace solutions. 
The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
"B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems," said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. "Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online." 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence.
