Dear Friends:

On Tuesday night, Republican Randy Forbes was elected to represent one of the 
most competitive, Democratic-leaning districts in America:  Virginia's 4th 
Congressional District.  President Clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 
1996, and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 
(even while they won statewide).

Despite the tough odds, Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the 
strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of 
President Bush.  While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative 
campaigning, Forbes won the district by more than 5,000 votes.

The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush.  Democrats 
were desperate to win, but Republicans won another victory in a swing 
district.

To give you a bit of historical perspective, there have been 78 special 
elections over the past 25 years.  Only 19 of those special elections 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and only three of 
those 19 swung toward the party of the President.  Historical odds were not 
in his favor, but Representative-elect Forbes defied the odds.

So what does this history-defying Republican victory mean to us on a national 
level?  The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide 
momentum across the political spectrum for President Bush's agenda for 
America.

And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum.  You helped 
President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldn't be 
done - a bipartisan $1.35 trillion tax relief package.  The first round of 
tax relief checks was mailed yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate your 
helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve.

If President Bush is to succeed in improving our schools, rebuilding our 
military, saving Social Security and Medicare and ushering in the 
responsibility era, he will need your continued help and involvement.

President Bush is counting on all of us to become his Team Leaders.  Learn 
more about this unique opportunity to spread the President's message and help 
retain and increase our majorities in 2002 by visiting

Again, thank you for your continued efforts.  Without you, odds are we 
wouldn't have been able to win in Virginia.

Very truly yours,


Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Background on VA-04 Special Election
June 20, 2001

Upset in Virginia Special Election

A Victory for White House & National GOP

Republican Team Pulls Together, Victory a Model for
'01 and '02 Elections

-- Last night, Randy Forbes was elected to represent Virginia's 4th district, 
receiving 52.1% (70,926 votes) to Democrat Louise Lucas' 47.9% (65,189 
votes).  This election is a swing district-President Clinton won the district 
by 1% in 1992 and 7% in 1996, while President Bush won the district by less 
than 1,000 votes.

--  In the past 25 years, there have been 78 special elections.  Only 19 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and of the 19, 
only 3 swung toward the party of the President.  Now 4.

--  President Bill Clinton pre-recorded thousands of turnout calls for this 
special election.

-- The voters embraced the President's policies.

-- Most importantly the President's policies were embraced in a moderate 
swing district drawn by Democrats, further evidence that President Bush is 
addressing the issues that affect and unite everyone.

-- Randy Forbes ran on the programs, policies and momentum of President Bush. 
Randy ran on moving the President's policies forward and now the results are 
in and the outcome is clear.

-- Media pundits recognized that this would be a referendum on the President.

Bob Novak, of The Chicago Sun-Times: "A mailing came out from the Democratic 
candidates...saying...there's no doubt who the Bush Republican will help, who 
it will hurt -- six million minority families and 12 million children will be 
left behind."  (CNN's "Inside Politics," 06/07/01)

Mark Shields: "Larry, is this Virginia race really an early referendum on 
President George W. Bush?" U.Va. Professor Larry Sabato: "To a certain agree 
I think it is."  (CNN?s "Capital Gang," 06/16/01)

"Numerous national analysts called the [special election] a test of the two 
parties' strengths and a possible bellwether for the fight for control of the 
House of Representatives in 2002.  Some of the national cachet surrounding 
the contest comes from its status as the first congressional election since 
Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' defection from the GOP switched control of 
the Senate?"  (Tyler Whitley, "Lucas, Forbes Push Turnout," The Richmond 
Times-Dispatch, 06/19/01)

"...a contest that's being widely viewed as an early indicator of voter 
attitudes toward Bush and his policies.  The result, said Stuart Rothenberg, 
an independent analyst of congressional campaigns, is that the race looms as 
'a sort of referendum on George W. Bush, on the energy issue, on Social 
Security and on the direction of the country.'  Indeed, Rothenberg and others 
will review the outcome as a possible harbinger for the 2002 midterm 
elections."  (Robert L. Jackson, "Va. House Race May Show GOP What It Faces 
In '02," Los Angeles Times, 06/17/01)

"National politicians view the toss-up race in Virginia's 4th District not 
only as a possible referendum on the Bush administration but also as a 
bellwether race that will determine which party has the momentum heading into 
the 2002 elections."  (Allison Stevens, "Polls See Virginia Race As Preview 
Of Battle For The House In 2002," The Hill, 06/13/01)

Bob Edwards: "The election is being portrayed as a referendum on the Bush 
administration."  (NPR's "Morning Edition," 06/13/01)

Fred Barnes: "This election in the fourth district of Virginia is the Vieques 
of elections.  It's the testing ground for this Social Security issue.  And 
if the Democrat, who is an African- American woman named Louise Lucas, if she 
wins, Democrats are going to rightly conclude, this Social Security issue is 
dynamite, and we can attack Bush's partial privatization bill."  (Fox's "Fox 
News Sunday," 06/17/01)

"Political analysts said the race would be viewed as an early referendum on 
the Bush administration and as a bellwether for next year's midterm 
elections."  (Larry O'Dell, "State Senators Compete For Open Seat In 
Congress," The Associated Press, 06/19/01)

"[T]oday's by-election in Virginia's Fourth District has become a referendum 
on Mr. Bush's first five months. If the Democrats win, they will argue that 
Mr. Bush has once again been rejected and that they have the momentum for 
next year's crucial mid-term elections."  (Damian Whitworth, "Battle Flares 
As Virginia Poll Puts Bush To Test," The London Times, 06/19/01)
