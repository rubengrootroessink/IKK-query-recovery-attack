After three and a half years as CFO Enron Europe, Paul Chivers has decided to 
move on from the Global Finance Group and is considering commercial 
assignments within Enron both here in Europe and in Houston. Paul has made a 
significant contribution to Enron's European business in building a team that 
consistently delivers financing for our transactions. We wish him every 
success in the future.

Effective immediately, Anne Edgley will assume the position of CFO Europe. 
Please join us in welcoming her to this new role. 


John Sherriff, Michael Brown and Ben Glisan
