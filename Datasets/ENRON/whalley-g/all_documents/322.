Greg, I received the list of players on the PG&E side today from Glynn's 
office.  I called Mark Haedicke to give him the rundown, and he feels 
comfortable with you and Jeff attending the meeting alone.  As Jeff will be 
arriving in Dallas from San Francisco, you will need to get yourself to 
Dallas; however, we will add your name to the manifest for the return to 
Houston unless we hear otherwise from you.  

Below are the details as we know them now:

Date:  Friday, June 22
Time:  12:30 p.m.-2:30 p.m.
Location: 100 Crescent Court, 6th Floor (Wasserstein's offices), Dallas
PG&E players: Bob Glynn, Chairman & CEO, PG&E Corp.
  Gordon Smith, President & CEO, PG&E utility
  Fong Wan, VP, Risk Initiatives, PG&E Corp.
  Ken Beckfire, Wasserstein
  Joe Sauvage, Investment Advisor, Lehman Bros.
ENE players: Jeff Skilling
  Greg Whalley

As new details become available, we'll pass them to you right away.  SRS
