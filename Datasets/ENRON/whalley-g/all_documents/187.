Dear Friends,

President-elect Bush has brought together an excellent group to serve as his
Cabinet.  His nominees are a diverse, experienced, and strong group.  They
will help enact his agenda, change the tone in Washington and make us proud.

Your help is needed to get these outstanding men and women confirmed by the
United States Senate.  Some of President-elect Bush's nominees are being
unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from
you.

One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft,
President-elect Bush's choice for Attorney General.

The hallmark of Senator Ashcroft's long history of public service has been
integrity.  As Attorney General, he will uphold the law and make the
Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of.

He brings a unique record of service to this challenge.  He was twice
elected Missouri's Attorney General, serving with both Republican and
Democrat Governors.  He was elected Governor of Missouri, an important swing
state, and then reelected with 64% of the vote.  John then was elected to
the U.S. Senate, where he just finished a six-year term.  No other Attorney
General has ever had this wealth of experience.

John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues, including:

- Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri
Attorney General's office by attracting strong men and women to serve his
state and strictly upholding the law
- As Senator, co-Sponsored the Violence Against Women Act
- As Governor, signed Missouri's first Hate-Crimes Bill and fought to
protect victims' rights
- Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor
- Made Education Reform a priority as Governor
- Toughened penalties for crimes committed with a Gun
- Worked To protect children at school, strengthen classroom safety
- Voted For background checks at pawn shops
- Was Endorsed By Missouri Law Enforcement Agencies
- Supported 26 of 28 African-Americans nominated to the Federal bench
- Was commended as Governor by one of the oldest Black Bar Associations for
his record of appointing minorities
- Appointed many African-Americans to Missouri's courts
- Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King
holiday
- Created an award honoring George Washington Carver's Accomplishments,
saved Lincoln College, an historic Black college founded by African-American
veterans of the Civil War.

Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge
Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Every Republican
Senator opposed White's confirmation, in part, because he urged a lower
legal standard for a man convicted of first-degree murder 4 times (including
the first degree murder of three police officers).

Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he
disagrees.  This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new
Administration.  Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to
carry out the letter of the law.   He will restore the rule of law to the
Justice Department and run a highly professional department.

Please do two things.

First, let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation
process for John Ashcroft.

Go to http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm to find the
contact information for the Senators from your state.

Second, let the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee know you support
John Ashcroft's confirmation.  The committee begins its hearings Tuesday.

Finally, two recent comments from current United States Senators:

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) had this to say about the Ashcroft
nomination:

"'I think it represents a very good choice'. . . the only things people want
in an attorney general are 'good management, sound judgment and high
integrity.  They're not easy to find in one individual, but I think John
Ashcroft has all of them.'"  "I certainly assume I will be voting for
him."  - Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) (David Kocieniewski, "Staunch Democrat
Eases Up on Opposition," The New York Times, January 6, 2001; Audrey Hudson,
"Democrats Set For Ashcroft's Confirmation," The Washington Times, January
4, 2001) (emphasis added)

Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) Commended Ashcroft.

"I rise to pay tribute to Senator John Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the
Senate. . . . Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who served his
state and his country with distinction.  I join my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors."  (Congressional
Record, December 15, 2000)

Thank you.

(Please forward this message to friends, family and co-workers and ask them
to show their support for President-elect Bush by asking their U.S. Senators
to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft)
