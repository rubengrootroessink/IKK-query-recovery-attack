Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* The three-pack of Capstone microturbines capable of generating 90kW
of electricity has surpassed 6,000 hours (9 months) of non-stop operation at
a PanCanadian Petroleum oilfield in Alberta.  Not only has the units
achieved this length of operation, but they have done so at maximum output
with 100% availability.  Owing to their success with these units,
PanCanadian recently placed another three-pack of Capstone microturbines at
their Pelican Lake facility.
* Following the announcement that the exclusive joint development
agreement for fuel processor technology between UOP and Avista Labs
(subsidiary of Avista Corporation) would expire and not be renewed, UOP
intends to offer this fuel processor technology on a non-exclusive basis to
various fuel cell developers.
* Bergerat Monnoyeur Travaux Publics (BME), a Caterpillar dealer in
France, has ordered 51 Active Power flywheels (CleanSource(tm) DC) valued at
$1.4 million.  The units will be used to protect a 10 MW wafer fab facility
owned by STMicroelectronics in that country.
