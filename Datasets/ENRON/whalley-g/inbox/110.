Wow!  Does Enron Market the cool flying name thing I got when I opened your email?
You guys are amazing. Thanks very much for being such a fun group and for the compliment.
It is called Robert Parker's Wine Cellar Software, or similar, and available at wineenthusiast.com or, they also have a phone/catalog ordering option with the number on the site.  It is excellent.
Cheers!
Andrea

Hi Andrea,
 
It was great sitting next to you last night. The evening was great fun and you did a great job.
