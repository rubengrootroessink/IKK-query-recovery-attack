Greg and Jeff:

Paula Rieker has a secure line reserved for a telephonic board meeting - tentatively starting at 7:00 am - if it is needed.  The board meeting is of course contingent on a favorable response from Moody's and some resolution of the bid/ask spread around the exchange rate.  Paula will need approximately 30 minutes in order to get a quorum for the call.

I am in my office at 3-5603 and Paula is in her's at 5-7676.

Regards.
