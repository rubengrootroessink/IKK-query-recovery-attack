Greg,

One of my concerns regarding the merger is future compensation.  It is well known throughout the industry that Dynegy pays the lowest bonuses.  What incentive do we have to make money next year knowing bonuses in 2002 will be abysmal?  For that matter, what guarantees will be made in order to prevent a massive exodus next year for this reason?

Thank you for your attention,

Andy
