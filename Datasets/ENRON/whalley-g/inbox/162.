Lawrence,
I hope you and your family are fine. Is there someone from your friends
and relatives, who is involved in this terrible strikes in New York and
Washington? I hope not, if yes let me know who.
You may remember Dan Plice, who made a joke on Hub's party as he told
us, that Ronald Reagen is his uncle. He lives since 10 years in NewYork,
doing business in IT. At the moment I have no living sign form him but
hope he is ok.
Unfortunatly this is a bad time to congratulate and feel happy with
someone, who did a great step foreward in his career, but I want to use
this email to do so. Believe me, all members of the Stammtisch are proud
to have you, the new COO of ENRON, as a friend.
Say hello to Kathrin, Mary and Nicolas.
Servus
Ferdl


PS: You missed a big trinking time on the weekend of the 25th aniversary
of the Stammtisch. More info's and pictures will follow later.
