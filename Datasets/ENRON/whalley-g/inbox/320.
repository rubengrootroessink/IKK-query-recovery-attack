Dear Mr. Whalley,

I hope that you will take the time to read the content of my message below
sent to Dynegy this afternoon before too much more time elapses.

I understand that you are a military academy graduate and an ex-Armored
Corps Officer. I share a similar background to your own though my academy
was RMA Sandhurst in England and I am ex-Artillery. What we should have in
common, I trust, is the knowledge that men need to be led. Many men and
women employed by Enron are presently feeling that they are without
Leadership and that they have been deserted. This is not an exagerration. I
trust that you have retained your leadership skills and will exercise them
without further delay. The people need a champion.

Sincerely,

Julian Langham

This is directed to the Head of Investor Relations

I am sending this email as a Shareholder of a significant quantity of both
Dynegy and Enron stock and only hope it reaches someone in the upper
echelon's of Dynegy management. I will also be sending this directly to Greg
Whalley at Enron Corp. I am an Executive Recruiter working for a
Houston-based Search Firm that recruits professionals for Enron. I do not
recruit personnel out of Enron for placement elsewhere. However, in the past
ten days, our Firm has been deluged with telephone calls and resumes from
power, gas and other commodity traders, marketers, originators, risk,
mid-office and back office personnel from Enron and, to a lesser extent,
Dynegy, from lower level specialists to Directors wanting us to find them
employment elsewhere. We have asked all of them what their motivation is
and, almost to the last, it's not that they want to "jump ship" because they
don't want to go to work for Dynegy, it's because they don't know what's
happening. No one from the top of their respective companies is talking to
them. They say there is this huge vacuum of any information at all and they
are wondering "where are the Leaders to reassure us"?

The Houston Chronicle today reports in an article that the two companies
want to make certain that key executives and traders in particular are kept
"on board" the new company. We just want you to know that apparently you're
not doing a very good job of it and that you are risking losing some of the
best and brightest that your two firms employ and that you need to do
something about it...and do it now! Please!

Sincerely yours,

Julian Langham
