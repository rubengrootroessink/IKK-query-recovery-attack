Hello, Greg:

It's Bob Frank, USMA 70, and past President of the Houston West Point
Society.
Let me add my name to the long list of those congratulating you...

Greg, this email is to introduce my executive search firm--Pointer
Resources, Inc., with the hope of arranging a conversation with you about
the creative possibilities for working together. Even if you have no
immediate
executive recruiting needs, this may be the perfect time for us to get to
know each other.

*	For 20 years, I've practiced executive search and corporate
recruiting here in Houston, with assignments all over the US and Latin
America. Clients as large as Tenneco Oil and Compaq and as small as
Emerging.com attest to my record.

*	We're small and very, very effective. No competitor can outgun me or
underbid me. From finding a top COO to building a department of 20, I
can...and have...done it all.

*	And done it with an entrepreneurial twist. Investment banking and
competitive intelligence transactions are frequent corollaries to my work.

Your success at Enron is nothing short of impressive. I imagine you may have
a subject or two on your mind which may be worthy of exploration...can we
talk sometime, Greg? Thank you for your consideration.

With best regards,
= b o b   f r a n k  =
Robert S. Frank, President
Pointer Resources, Inc. - Houston
