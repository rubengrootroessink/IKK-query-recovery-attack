I would prefer to leave my name off this memo and we can address Rich at the EBS level.  Getting known as the corporate "hatchet man" (as has now been expressed to me many times over the last several days) does not appear to be a career enhancing move as well as security personnel have indicated that I may encounter significant personal exposure as it relates to my proposed role.

I will continue to assist in the restructuring of Enron Corp. but have no interest in painting a bulls eye on my chest or endangering my family.

Regards,

Jim
