Greg,

I am a new Associate from Georgetown and I am very excited to be part of Enron.   I hope to earn great success in the future and will work tremendously hard to show my very best here.  I would enjoy an opportunity to sit down for lunch with you to hear your perspective on the company and success factors.  I think you would be an excellent person to talk to for two reasons: 

1)	Your success in the Associate Program and extensive multi-divisional experience within the company.  
2)	Your advanced knowledge of drivers and opportunities within the energy industry.

Regards,
Jason Jennaro
