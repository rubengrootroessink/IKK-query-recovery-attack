Greg Whalley has asked Stan for a meeting to discuss EGS' cash studies.   In this meeting, Stan would like to include Rod Hayslett and extend a courtesy invitation to Mark Frevert.

Is your executive available for 30 minutes on Wednesday, October 24, at either 8:30AM; 9:00AM; or 9:30AM?  Or Thursday, October 25, at 9:00AM?
