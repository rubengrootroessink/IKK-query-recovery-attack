ENE: Adjust Historical EPS As Per Restatements; Lower 4Q & 2002 Ests.

*	We adjust Enron's historical EPS for the restatements filed in their
8K published on November 8th.
*	We revise our stand-alone 2002 EPS estimates to $1.50 from $2.15.
We think this could prove conservative, but await further data on Enron's
ongoing performance in their energy trading & marketing business.
*	Enron is currently trading at a relatively large 20% discount to
their implied merger value of $12.40.  We think this spread could contract
as certainty improves over accounting issues, stand-alone earnings power,
and the scope of hurdles to merger completion.
