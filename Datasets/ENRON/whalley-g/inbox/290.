Knowledge Management (KM) Systems Changing with the Demands of Oil & Gas
Industry; Houston Workshop Examines New Paradigm

Houston, Texas (November 7, 2001) A more practical KM model is emerging for
the oil and gas industry that catalogs and networks a company's experience
rather than documenting its practices. Under this model, a firm's collective
experience and its members' specialized knowledge and credentials are
cataloged to allow users to quickly and efficiently leverage the extended
organization.  

This approach helps with two macro trends in oil and gas: (1) the trend
towards core competency development, and (2) the creation of an extended
workforce as a large proportion of management reach retirement.  Management
are able to create a dynamic network of experts and resources that spread
across many partnering organizations as well as semi-retired employees.

Entitled "Creating Successful Knowledge Management (KM) Systems:
Communicating Experience Rather than Documenting Practices," a workshop on
December 4, 2001 at Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center will present
this new KM approach in advance of the Interactive Energy conference and
exhibition.  www.interactiveenergy.com/2001/workshopfour.asp

"What we've found is that linking people is the most important element in
knowledge management," said Richard Fletcher, a senior KM consultant in the
energy practice at Deloitte Consulting.  "The second most important element
is capturing learning rather that abstract procedures or static
information."

The morning workshop will be led by Richard N. Fletcher, global knowledge
manager, Energy Practice, Deloitte Consulting; Todd Knight, chief technology
officer at Luminant Worldwide;  and Patrick Talley, cofounder, Aviri, a
software company that has designed a unique system for the new KM networks.
Delegates will be able to participate in a design exercise to formulate a KM
system and provide an understanding of the benefits and effort necessary to
institute such a system.  The fee is $295 or delegates may register to
attend the complete conference and two half-day workshops for $1095.  To
register online, delegates should go to www.interactiveenergy.com or phone
Mel Ladin directly at 832-200-3704.
