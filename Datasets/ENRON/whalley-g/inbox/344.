Payments are seen by Treasury, Bowen and Me (as Cash person at the moment).  Payments of the specific nature we are talking about would not be seen by anyone outside  that group.  Hickerson only sees aggregate cash and new bank accounts (whihc is how he saw Swapco).

It would not be visible apart from to Ray.
