Attached is a revised draft of the letter from Ken Lay to employees about the healthcare benefits plan.  Specifically, this letter points out that Enron has elected not to increase medical costs for employees this year, but emphasizes that employees should plan for increased costs next year.  The letter will be part of an Open Enrollment package that employees will receive at their homes.

Please forward comments on the letter to me or Mikie Rath.
