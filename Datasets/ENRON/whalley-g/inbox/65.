Greg,

Just thought I'd share with you that I was Joe's chauffeur from the airport
last night.  We had a great visit and he was a wonderful speaker for our
tri-service academy dinner.  He was extremely complimentary of you as well.
Perhaps I can book you in advance for next year!!

Also, I was driving through Southern California last week and saw a tractor
/ trailer with a load marked "Enron Wind".  An hour later I drove through
the prop-covered hills.  What an awesome display.

I know you're swamped, but when you have a chance to come up for air, let me
know when you're up for a visit.
