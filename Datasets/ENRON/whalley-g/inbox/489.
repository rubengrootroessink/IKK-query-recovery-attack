Summary:

*	A quick look at the correlation between the performance of the
Energy Technology stocks and the price changes in both natural gas and oil.
*	Our conclusion is that there is no meaningful statistical
correlation over time.  Commodity price shocks may however exert short term
influences on the shares but should not be used as a predictor.
