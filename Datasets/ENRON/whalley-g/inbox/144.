Metropolitan Racquet Club -- directions
The Club is located in the One Allen Center Garage at 340 West Dallas St. In order for us to validate your parking ticket (up to 1.5 hours) you must enter the Garage on West Dallas Street - - you'll notice the blue Metropolitan Racquet Club awning at the entrance. Immediately after you drive into the garage, turn right to get a ticket and follow the "reserved for Racquet Club" signs to the obvious parking spaces. Take the elevator to the 6th floor Racquet Club and ask the attendant to direct you upstairs to the public dining area. You will then see our reserved area behind accordion-style folding doors.
