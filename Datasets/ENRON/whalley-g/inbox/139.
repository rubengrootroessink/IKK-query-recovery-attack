Below are our bid/offers for the product described in the confirmation drafted by Steve Hall.  A different confirm could change these prices.  It is my understanding that the deal team has not yet agreed to the Steve Hall version of the confirm.  

Please note that these prices are for a stipulated hourly shape and include CAISO energy and associated ancillary services including regulation up, regulation down, spin, non-spin, and replacement reserves.  This pricing also assumes a good credit, wholesale counterparty with no regulatory contingencies or recission rights.  It also assumes that liquidated damages/early termination payments are cleaner than those associated with retail load contracts as all of these products exist in the wholesale market independent of whether direct access exists or not. 

Here they are:
