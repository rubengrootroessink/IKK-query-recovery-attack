 Whales,
 Just a short note to congratulate you on your success at Enron.  I had an
email written shortly after your promotion but then the 9/11 shi* happened
and I lost track of it.  Well now that you guys are back in the news quite
a
bit I figured that I should at least send you a note.

 Even considering the issues currently facing Enron, I am sure you will
emerge strong and better than before- you always had a knack for that at
school and I am sure it will continue now.

We started down the track of doing business with you guys (in the areas of
financial products and insurance) but I don't know how the upcoming merger
will effect that.  Just found out that my plebe year Squad Leader Ricky
Waddell (Rhodes Scholar and Academic All American in football) works for
you
in S. America. Great guy!

Are you thinking of going to the Army/Navy game?  Two ranked teams!!!  I am
heading back with John Heller (the football player not the swimmer).  He
has
a skybox and we might have some extra tickets so let me know.

Best of luck and I look forward to catching up with you.
