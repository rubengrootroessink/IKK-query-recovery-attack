First, good luck next week.  
 
Also, I will be in the office all next week and if you need anything, ENW related or not, call me or have someone call me and I will help.  I am focused on making sure EOL and ENW do not pop up on your list of things to think about.
 
Webb and Richter have been told that EOL up and performing well is critical.  As you know, the trade counts looked good last week and Jay and Brad have been getting data to Louise on the specifics of certain counterparties, etc.
 
I am having breakfast meetings with Directors and above in ENW all next week to listen to what they have been hearing and saying and to keep them informed, focused and motivated.
 
My extension is 36635 and my cell is 713-646-4734.
 
Thanks.
