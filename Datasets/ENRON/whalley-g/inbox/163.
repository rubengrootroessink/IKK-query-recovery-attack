One thing I learned from my experience in Vietnam is that  terrorists hope by their actions to strike fear into our hearts and disrupt  the everyday functions of our society.  Thus a few cowards can succeed  in humbling and disrupting millions.  I refuse to give in to  these cowards and pray for everyone that has been affected by these  senseless actions.  Thus the West Point luncheon cheduled for this Friday,  Sept 14th at 11:30 a.m. is still on and I look forward to seeing you  there!  All the best,  Jon E. King '65 President WPSGH   http://www.wpsgh.org

The West Point Society of Greater Houston Cordially Invites You to Join Us  at Our Monthly Luncheon

Please mark your calendars and RSVP Now to Ms. Marsha  Winkler at 713 942-7775 and or Jon King at 713 981-9595 and plan to join  us for our first fall luncheon on FRIDAY, September 14, 2001 at Noon at  Brennan's Restaurant, conveniently located on the edge of downtown Houston at  3300 Smith Street. 
This month's program will feature a very timely talk by a  fascinating speaker, Professor Michael Economides, whose topic is, The First  Energy Crisis of the Twenty First Century. 
By way of brief background, our speaker is the Author of a new  book titled The Color of Oil - The History, Money and Politics of the World's  Biggest Business. He is Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University  of Houston and a technical advisor to national oil  companies. Professor Economides has co-authored 7 textbooks and more than 150  journal papers and articles. He recently co-authored a paper titled: "U.S.  National Energy Policy and the Role of Ultra-Deepwater". We hope that you will  join us as this promises to be a very enlightening presentation by a very  popular speaker on a topic that is critically important to both our local and  national economies.
 
The cost for our Brennan's three course meal is $25.00 per  person (which includes tax, & gratuity). 
We look forward to seeing you  next Friday, September 14, 2001.
