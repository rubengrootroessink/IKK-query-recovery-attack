Greg and Jeff:

Bruce Garner just spoke to me about our base metals business.  He believes there is industry money that may either buy the business or sponsor a management buy-out and that we should pursue such prior to any rationalizing that business.  What's your reaction?

If it is positive, I recommend deputizing Bruce to lead the process.
