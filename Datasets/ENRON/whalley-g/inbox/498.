Metropolitan Racquet Club -- directions
The Club is located in the One Allen Center Garage at 340 West Dallas St. In
order for us to validate your parking ticket (up to 1.5 hours) you must
enter the Garage on West Dallas Street - - you'll notice the blue
Metropolitan Racquet Club awning at the entrance. Immediately after you
drive into the garage, turn right to get a ticket and follow the "reserved
for Racquet Club" signs to the parking spaces. Take the elevator to the 6th
floor Racquet Club and ask the attendant to direct you upstairs to the
public dining area. You will then see our reserved area behind
accordion-style folding doors towards the back of the dining area.
