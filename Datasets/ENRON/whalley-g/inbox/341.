Greg,
I have been a dedicated Enron employee for two years.  I was originally part of the Research group and now work for EIM Fundamentals.  This is a very difficult and exciting time both  for our company and for me as an employee.  I would like to be more involved in this process.  Does your office currently have ANY type of position where I can make most contribution to the company.
Thank you,

Yana Kristal
