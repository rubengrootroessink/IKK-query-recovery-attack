Jay has been pulling reports over the last couple of days and so far so good.  Reported attached if you need it.

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

Thanks!
