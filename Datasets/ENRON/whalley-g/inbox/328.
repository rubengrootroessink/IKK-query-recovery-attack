New startup proposes global virtual services
Marlene Tissot
12 November 2001=20
A project to build a global network for multimedia services, based entirely=
 on switched virtual circuits (SVCs), has been revealed to CWI. And it inte=
nds to prove the value of connectionless network services for customers by =
carrying output from the Olympic Games in Beijing around the world. While n=
ew carriers are counting their cash and hoping to hold the fort until the m=
arket turns around, SynerG Communications Ltd., believes it can prove to ev=
erybody that it is still possible to launch an ambitious telecoms business,=
 even in these harsh times. Backed by an Asian media mogul that prefers to =
keep a low profile, as well as an equipment vendor and a network operator i=
n the United States, its founders claim SynerG already has verbal commitmen=
ts from customers amounting to $100 million in revenues. And they say they =
are negotiating to gain rights to carry multimedia content from the Beijing=
 Olympics in 2008. SynerG's business plan is based on a relatively uncommon=
 way to deliver bandwidth. Ken Rice, the chairman and founder of California=
-based International SynerG Communications Holdings Ltd., says that potenti=
al cost savings for end-users will be compelling because they will be able =
to provision bandwidth on an ad hoc basis, giving them so-called bandwidth =
on demand. A 41-node global ATM-based switched virtual circuit network will=
 focus on delivering content across Asia, Europe and North America. Under m=
ost existing contracts, customers pay for leased-line capacity they do not =
actually use, according to Rice, who claims his project is significantly di=
fferent. "It's a utility-based network," says Rice. "(It) generates billing=
 for what is used, not what is contracted for as in fixed line configuratio=
ns." But while end users are increasingly scrutinizing their spend, they ha=
ve also grown accustomed to always-on fat pipes and will need reassurance o=
f the constant availability of the circuits. "If you are a customer, you ne=
ed to be sure that the capacity is there at all time," says Maureen Coulter=
, a senior analyst at Gartner Group in Egham, England. "SVCs are appropriat=
e for content as long as the service provider manages the quality of transp=
ort for the end-user." SynerG claims that this quality of service will be e=
nsured by employing Pathfinder, its proprietary network management software=
. And the business plan for SynerG shows Lucent Technologies and AT&T among=
 its suppliers and shareholders. Lucent has taken a 2.11% equity stake, and=
 a network provisioning deal gives AT&T a possible equity option. AT&T has =
experience marketing SVCs in the U.S., although in the case of SynerG it is=
 thought only to be providing bandwidth from its global network. There migh=
t also be something in the new network business model for SynerG's circuit =
supplier. Even if revenues from providing the circuits to SynerG are not im=
mense, neither is the risk the carrier takes by doing it, since it gets a r=
evenue share each time bandwidth is used by a customer. While the cost of o=
ffering such a service is moderate, it may provide a new stream of revenue =
for carriers. "It's something I expect we'll see more and more," said Gartn=
er's Coulter. "In the content distribution market ... carriers want to sque=
eze every penny out of their capacity." To make sure it can guarantee deliv=
ery to consumers, SynerG says it will operate a 41-node ATM-based switched =
virtual circuit network in nine European countries and 23 city networks in =
the U.S., according to its business plan. Operations will be headed up by c=
hief executive Fred Metzgen, a former business development director for BT =
Syncordia Global Solutions, who will be based in Newport Beach, California.=
 Metzgen has been touring Europe and the U.S. to get the $10-million startu=
p funds he estimates SynerG needs. Metzgen has acquired a portfolio of pote=
ntial partners and content distributors, including education and training t=
echnology developer China Education Network, digital video developer Electr=
ic Image and e-commerce platform developer Evolutionary Networks, Inc. Syne=
rG has taken shareholdings in some of these.=20
