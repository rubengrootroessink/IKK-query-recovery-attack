Greg,

My Thursday just filled up.  But I'm still targeting either Tuesday or
Wednesday to be in the neighborhood.  I have to turn in my TA-50 to my
former unit, 4-112 Armor, which is in Bryan.  Houston is just another hour
from there.  I suspect  your schedule is going to be swamped for the next
few months, if not years.  If next week is too soon, my long-term calender
is not too difficult to sort out at this time.  Just let me know so I won't
inconvenience you.

Were you planning on coming up for the TCU game?

Woody
