Yes....I have been very concerned about reloading our keys guys.  Ken asked me about this and timing a couple of weeks ago and i suggested exactly what you are thinking.  I don't think we can wait until year end.  The opportunity to get everyone back in the money quickly and have a financial reason to stay and work through all of our issues is important.  

How big of a group are you thinking?  Jeff and I have our top MDs/ VPs into a couple of groupings.  It also really depends on what the goal is.  

I'm in tomorrow.

Mike

Given what our announcement next week is going to look like,  do you think it is a good idea to issue some options to some key players soon after the announcement.  as sort of a down payment on bonus perhaps.  i think it would be best to keep it to a reasonably small group.  lets try to talk tomorrow and see if you have anyone we need to do this for.
