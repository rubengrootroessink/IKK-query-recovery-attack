John,
 
It seems everyone has received some level of interest in some sort of combination of the Paper, Steel and Metals businesses.  I have discussed with Greg that we ask Bruce Garner to organize the expressions of interest and see if there is anything real here.  So he will be talking with Gold and others with respect to the Metals side of this.
 
Regards,
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
To recap my discussion with Barrick today.  They are interested in what is happening here and would be interested in finding a way to participate in any potential MBO type opportunity.  They have an interest in the MG business, steel and then FP in order of preference.  
Barrick has indicated that they have the management time and interest in the support of a deal.  They have also indicated the willingness of putting in $150 mm in hard equity with the potential of using their name/credit for trading risk.  
 
regards
bruce

Guys,
 
I know you are busy and this might be just a flyer but Barrick might be someone to think about if we are looking for Capital.  This note is from the head of Corporate Development and I know the CFO and CEO very well.  They are single A rated with $700 mm in cash on the balance sheet (net debt is zero).   FYI - their market cap is $6bn (abx ticker)
 
 We have had lots of discussions with these guys in the past about JV in trading gold.  I think they could move fast and be very discrete.  Let me know if you are interested in me talking or introducing you to them?
 
regards,
bruce
