Greg,
Here are the 3rd quarter stats for George.  These numbers go through the last day that George was active (Sept.10).

		Q2		Q3		% Change
Avg. Trades	208		281		+35%
Avg. Volume 	9,612,412	12,745,612	+33%
Avg. Cntprty	9		15		+67%
Total Cntprty	32		42		+31%

Obviously, the numbers dropped off after the events of Sept. 11 and after George was turned over to the desk.  Here are the stats for that period.

		Sept. 11-28
Avg. Trades	171		
Avg. Volume 	6,390,714	
Avg. Cntprty	17		
Total Cntprty	48		

I know this isn't exactly at the top of your list.  Let me know when you have some time.
