Greg:


Implement Tradeco.
Determine if Dynegy is willing to lend $850 to $900 million against TransWestern
Contact Moody's and ask how much equity we need
Tap all potential sources of equity:
-	Dynegy
-	Federal Reserve/Treasury
-	Banks (Citi, Chase)
-	Industry players (unlikely in time required)
If funds are likely, get stay from Moody's until Monday

Tell me what you want me to do and I'll get after it.

Jeff
