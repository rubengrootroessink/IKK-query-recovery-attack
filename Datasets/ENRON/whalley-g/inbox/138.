In the effort to understand this better is it fair to say that wholesale block prices between Friday afternoon and today have fallen on the offer side by $7.00 MWHr?

For example, these were the prices on Friday:

	Jack in the Box	PG&E	Offer	$41.15;	A/S	$4.93;	Block to Shape	$1.25 = Total $47.33.
	
The total price to Jack was $60.31 and includes the following additional charges $3.03 losses, $3.40 interzonal congestion; $1.75 uplifts; $1.80 ISO charges; $0.50 settlements and $2.50 "contract/legal".

I don't believe ancillaries and shape have changed dramatically; therefore, it would suggest that wholesale markets have changed by the number indicated above.

Our information would suggest that SP 15 and NP 15 on-peak has not changed by this amount between Friday to today.

This leads to two results:
	a) the generator price is closer to our original offer and
	b) our original offer on Friday was out of market and EES paid too much for supply.

Each dollar on the California deals is approximately $2.0M in value recognized in the wholesale versus retail organizations.

Please clarify.

Below are our bid/offers for the product described in the confirmation drafted by Steve Hall.  A different confirm could change these prices.  It is my understanding that the deal team has not yet agreed to the Steve Hall version of the confirm.  

Please note that these prices are for a stipulated hourly shape and include CAISO energy and associated ancillary services including regulation up, regulation down, spin, non-spin, and replacement reserves.  This pricing also assumes a good credit, wholesale counterparty with no regulatory contingencies or recission rights.  It also assumes that liquidated damages/early termination payments are cleaner than those associated with retail load contracts as all of these products exist in the wholesale market independent of whether direct access exists or not.
