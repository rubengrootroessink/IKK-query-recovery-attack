About Your FREE Seminar:

History has shown that 85% of money managers don't beat 
the S&P 500 (their benchmark for success). So why blindly 
follow an investment "guru", or buy from a list of "Hot" 
stock picks from someone you've never heard of, when you 
can get the KNOWLEDGE and INFORMATION you need to make 
your OWN investment decisions and TAKE CONTROL of your 
investing.

During the FREE 90-minute seminar, you'll review the 
information needed to understand the inner workings of 
Wall Street and effectively manage your investments. No 
get-rick quick techniques, just smart and practical 
methods to help you manage your money:


* You'll learn how to research INFORMATION so it takes as   
  little time as possible to do the maximum research.

* You'll access powerful web-based investment TOOLS to find  
  investments that are appropriate for your own personal 
  objectives and your own personal tolerance for risk.

* You'll uncover new STRATEGIES to make better investment 
  decisions, and avoid the most common investing mistakes. 

With BusinessWeek Investor Workshops' simple 5-STEP INVESTING 
FORMULA, you'll see how to invest responsibly and build 
up your portfolio for early retirement. 

You'll learn:

* How to properly SEARCH for an investment
* How to NARROW stocks to find the best of the best
* How to use a combination of technical analysis and 
  indicators to TIME your entry
* How to determine exactly when to GET OUT 
* How to MONITOR your portfolio and stay on top of your 
  investments 

You'll also learn about 7 CASH FLOW INVESTING STRATEGIES; 
alternate investing methods to help you supercharge 
your portfolio:

1. Why index shares are making index mutual funds obsolete
2. How to generate monthly income using covered calls 
3. Using Options to make big profits with limited risk 
4. Profiting from market trends 
5. How to capitalize on the emotions of a stock split
6. Using LEAPS as a low-cost substitute for stocks
