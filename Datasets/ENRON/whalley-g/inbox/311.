Hi Greg,
 
Today I'll be kicking off our merger strategy from an IT perspective. The goal of this will be to position Enrons IT group as the obvious choice to take the merged company forward. This is in everyones best interest, even if they don't know it yet. This will be focussed purely at IT, but alligns with the overall goals of ENW.
 
You and Greg Whalley have my commitment to making this work and hence making the future merged company a success. What I need from you and Greg and David is help in quickly coming up with a retention policy to ensure our best people don't walk.
 
Regards
MRP
