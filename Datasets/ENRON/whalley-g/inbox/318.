Dear Lawrence:
		
We are so pleased that Steve Kean will be speaking at our conference on
Winning Globally:  Organizing for Global Growth on January 23, 2002.  As you
may know, Steve will be speaking on a panel on "Maintaining Gold-Standard
Ethics in a Global Era."  We hope that you will be able to join us at the
conference.  We would also like to invite you or a company representative to
participate in the 2002 International Career Fair at Stanford Graduate
School of Business, which will be held on the previous evening, Tuesday,
January 22, 5:00pm - 8:00pm.  

The goal of the International Career Fair is to facilitate interaction
between leading global companies and our talented MBAs looking for positions
of international scope.  The International Career Fair is strategically
timed to coincide with our second -year students' full time job searches and
to introduce you to first-year students interested in summer positions.

We anticipate over 300 second and first-year Stanford MBA students will
participate in the career fair and will be seriously interested in your
international opportunities.  Importantly, from the graduating Class of
2001, 58% reported their jobs were international in scope, 83% indicated
their company was international in scope, and 20% accepted positions in
international locations.  

The agenda is attached for your review.  Participation is free.  In
addition, you will have the option to interview students at the Career
Management Center interview rooms on Wednesday, January 23rd and Thursday,
January 24th.  

Please RSVP via our online form at
<http://wesley.stanford.edu/cmc/Recruiters/Forms/Ficf.html>, before Monday,
December 17th.   Space is limited!  Even if you do not know the exact
company representative(s) you will send, please RSVP ASAP to reserve your
company's participation, as space will be limited to the first 50
organizations. We recommend that your company representative be either: 1) a
manager or director of business areas that hire MBA talent, or 2) human
resources or global recruiting professionals who are responsible for
recruiting MBAs.

Confirmation and additional information will be sent to you once we receive
your RSVP.  We look forward to your participation in this exciting annual
event.  If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Carter at (650)
725-3236 or carter_charlotte@gsb.stanford.edu

Sincerely yours,


Charlotte Carter, Program Manager, MBA Career Management Center
