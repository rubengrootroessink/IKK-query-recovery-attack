Dear Greg,

I have worked for Enron South America for 3 years and currenty running
my own company called Xcedentes.com. Also, I spent a great deal of my
time at Enron Houston and know a lot of people that can bring real value
to the table.

In case I can be of any assistance at any time, do not hesitate to reach
me. For references you can check with the following people in Houston:
Scott Neal (East gas Desk, trading), Ted Noble (Financial Trading), Elsa
Piekelniek, Darren Maloney.

Good luck with your new position.

Regards,

Pablo Acevedo
