Greg & David,
As detailed by my Human Resource representative, my contract states that I can be involuntary terminated and not paid my guaranteed bonus or unpaid salary.   Further, while still holding a position at Enron Broadband Services, nearly 100% of my time is taken up by Enron Corporate activities.  Per above and consistent with my current role and responsibilities, I am respectfully requesting the following changes to my employment contract:
Change contract to be an obligation of Enron Corp. or surviving entity
Guarantee payment as of February 5, 2002, (not "annual bonus amount" but a guaranteed payment)
Commit to pay unpaid guaranteed payment and unpaid salary if involuntarily terminated
Change non-compete to earlier of end of the term or three months after last date of employment
Regards,
Jim
