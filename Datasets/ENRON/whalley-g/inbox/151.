General Whalley,

Kept thinking I would see you around outside to tell you personally how excited I was to hear of your promotion.
Just wanted to take a moment to tell you  how proud I am of you and your accomplishments.
I knew you would do a great job for Enron when Lloyd and I moved you here.  Little did I know How well.

It does my heart good to see someone of your calibre come into a new Corporate environment and progress to such heights.

Belated Congratulations,
Deborah Kallus
Enron Relocation Consultant
