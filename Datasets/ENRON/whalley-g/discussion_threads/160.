DAILY BRIEFING [http://www.businessweek.com/today.htm]

12/19 -- Special Report -- After the Meltdown: Crawling from the Dot-Com 
Wreckage
Yes, the carnage will get worse. But survivors -- and a healthier overall 
climate -- will ultimately emerge. Here's what's next
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001219_800.htm

 OTHER MELTDOWN STORIES:
 Return to Reality in the IPO Market

 The New VC Canon Is Caution
 http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001219_171.htm


12/20 -- The Fed Has No Time to Dawdle
It should have cut rates on Dec. 19. Every month Greenspan waits before 
acting makes it that much harder to avoid a downturn
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_822.htm

12/20-- Greenspan & Co. Could Pull the Trigger Before Long
Though the Fed declined to cut interest rates now, it may not even wait till 
the next policy meeting to act -- if the stock market keeps falling
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_617.htm

12/18 -- Greenspan's Ace in the Hole: Productivity
He still thinks its strong growth will avert a recession. But if the slowing 
continues, watch for quick rate-cut action
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001218_169.htm

webMethods' software lets incompatible computer systems talk to each other -- 
a neat trick that's keeping its stock above water
http://www.businessweek.com/ebiz/0012/es1221.htm

12/19 -- Why Homestore.com Isn't Yet Home Free
To cement its lead, the online real estate listings service  has bought 
Move.com and started eRealtor. Still, regulators and resurgent rivals could 
keep it from the winner's circle
http://www.businessweek.com/ebiz/0012/ec1219.htm

12/18 -- Is "the End of Mutual-Fund Dominance" Approaching?
Hardly. Predictions that the Web financial-services revolution will knock the 
vast fund industry for a loop are greatly exaggerated
http://www.businessweek.com/ebiz/0012/ep1218.htm

12/15 -- Clicking for Charity
Humanitarian sites help spread the holiday cheer by enabling you to make 
donations while working through your gift list

a good lawyer as well
http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/dec2000/sb20001221_624.htm

12/20 -- Buying Trouble with Free ISPs
No-fee Internet access was all the rage just a year ago. Now it is becoming
