Computerworld Honors Acta Technology in Annual 'Top 100 Emerging Companies to 
Watch'; Industry Publication Recognizes Leader in B2B Data Integration
? 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 4, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, has been selected 
as one of Computerworld's "Top 100 Emerging Companies to Watch," the 
magazine's annual review of new leaders in high technology. The magazine has 
selected Acta as a winner in the highly-competitive eCommerce category, which 
includes other leading B2B software companies such as Blue Martini (Nasdaq: 
BLUE), Saga Software (NYSE: AGS), and Ventro (Nasdaq: VNTR). 
"We are honored to be included in this year's list of emerging companies," 
said Acta CEO Carol Mills Baldwin. "B2B data integration is emerging as a 
must-have technology for businesses around the globe. Recognition for this 
technology in Computerworld is further validation of the category we have 
created." 
B2B data integration resolves one of the principle issues in eBusiness today: 
that back-office systems were not designed to meet the data demands of B2B 
eCommerce and analytic solutions. Those demands include speed, scalability, 
and access to both the real-time and historical data locked away in multiple 
back-office systems. By staging real-time and historical data from multiple 
systems in data caches, the Acta eCommerce Data Platform allows companies to 
deliver the data that is needed, when it is needed, both inside and outside 
the enterprise. 
Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B (cumulative) 
by 2005-driven by the need to provide information-rich data to partners, 
suppliers and customers for collaborative computing. 
With over 160 customers worldwide, Acta is well-poised to continue leading 
the growing B2B data integration market. In the past year, Acta has also won 
honors from Upside Magazine (Hot 100 private companies), DM Review (Winner, 
World Class Solutions) eWeek (Best Practices Award-B2B Category, Finalist), 
and Intelligent Enterprise (RealWare Awards-B2B Category, Finalist).
