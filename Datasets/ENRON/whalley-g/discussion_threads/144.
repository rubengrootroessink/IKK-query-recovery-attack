Ca energy issues are out of control. Consumer groups are screaming about 
gouging. I will email today's articles from the Chronicle. The market has 
gone down more today with MSFT info after hours. Will keep being choppy. Glad 
no further rearrangements at ENE. You mentioned Bonds the other day, do you  
want some tax free muni ideas. If so how far out would you be comfortable 
with? I will talk to my Dallas muni desk for suggestions. How big was that 
check I was watching for? Ben

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me
my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the
COO position.

   >Greg, how big was that last check you told me to watch for. I will
transfer the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to
close at 68 47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas
lower today. I will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished.
Also, will today's announcement about ENE effect you? Ben
