Cougar basketball season has once again begun and Enron has secured through 
its partnership with the University of Houston a suite at Hofheinz Pavilion 
for the 2000 - 2001 Men's Basketball Season.  The Cougars are an exciting 
team to watch this year under new Head Coach Ray McCallum and players like 
Alton Ford, Bernard Smith, and George Williams.  This is a great opportunity 
for your group/business unit to entertain clients, prospective customers, or 
host an employee event.  

The season schedule, listed below, has many exciting opponents including 
Texas, December 20, Georgetown, December 31, and Memphis, January 6.  The 
suite includes fifteen (15) tickets and four (4) VIP Parking passes.  For the 
use of the suite, $1,500 per game will be billed back to your Company Number 
and Cost Center.  You will also be responsible for all catering expenses if 
you choose to take advantage of the menu offered through Salt Grass 
Steakhouse.  A menu will be provided to you when you schedule a specific game 
date and food orders must be placed with Salt Grass Steakhouse at least ten 
(10) days prior to the game date.  

Dates will be filled on a first come, first serve basis and can be secured by 
contacting Greg Grissom (ext. 58741) or David Tagliarino (ext. 37883)
