Summary:

* Toyota Managing Director Hiroyuki Watanabe commented that broad
cooperation was needed on fuel cell technology development as it pertains to
vehicles in order to commercialize the technology for this application.
While Toyota continues to develop hybrid vehicles, Watanabe believes fuel
cell vehicle technology has high hurdles to overcome.  In February the
automaker unveiled a prototype fuel cell vehicle, the FCHV-3, which also
includes a secondary nickel-metal hydride battery.
