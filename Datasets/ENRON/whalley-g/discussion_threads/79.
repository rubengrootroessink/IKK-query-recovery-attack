Cover Story:
THE TECH SLUMP
Slowing growth in tech spending, not shrinkage, is what's in store. But that 
will be painful enough -- for the industry and the economy as a whole.
From Wednesday night until midday Monday, for subscribers only**
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/00_51/b3712001.htm
After midday Monday, for all readers:

Election 2000:
HOW BUSH WOULD LEAD
As the election process crawls to its seemingly inevitable conclusion, it 
looks like George W. will face a slowing economy, a divided Congress, and an 
uneasy nation. But don't judge W., who has a history of being underestimated, 
just yet.
From Wednesday night until midday Monday, for subscribers only**
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/00_51/b3712052.htm
After midday Monday, for all readers:

Special Report:
THE BEST PRODUCTS OF 2000
From an improved -- but still refreshingly low-tech -- $1 pencil to a BMW 
that goes for $130,000, we've picked out the best of this year's new  stuff. 
Now you can't complain that you don't know what to get anyone for the 
holidays!
