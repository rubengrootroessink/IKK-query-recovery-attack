Dear Valued Customer,

We've got great news.  There is a new feature for you, our subscribers.

At BusinessWeek Online we are always trying to make our Subscriber's 
experience easier and more fulfilling.  To that end, we have recently enabled 
BusinessWeek Online with  "Auto Log-In" functionality.

What does this mean to you?  "Auto Log-In" will allow you to access premium 
content at BusinessWeek.com without going through the step of entering you 
user name and password each and every time you visit.

Simply click on the link below and sign-in and check the box for auto log-in:

http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a14110a27878a63653009a0

Once you have enabled "Auto Log-In," you'll be able to go directly to the 
most current issue of BusinessWeek Magazine as well as easily access 5 years 
worth of searchable archives without ever having to log-in again.  You'll be 
able to access BusinessWeek Online faster and more efficiently than ever 
before.

Thanks for your continued support,



Greg Zorthian,

SVP BusinessWeek Online
