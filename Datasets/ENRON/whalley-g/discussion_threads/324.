Jennifer,  Jeff has a good point here.  I have added his comments to the

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Jeff
