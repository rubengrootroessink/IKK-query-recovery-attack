Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases 
he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed 
program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris 
called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that 
the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 
'pro-Enron'!

Best!
