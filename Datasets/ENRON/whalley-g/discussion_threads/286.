In the past few months, there have been protests at various Enron offices.
These protests have been primarily by consumer and other advocacy groups
representing different energy interests.  Attached are security and public
relations procedures to help you manage a protest should one arise at your
facility.  Feel free to provide this document to leaders in your
organization as appropriate.

Thank You.
