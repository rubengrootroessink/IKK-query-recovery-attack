USA: Dynegy trades $1.5 bln via online energy portal.

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity marketer 
Dynegy Inc. said on Monday its Dynegydirect Internet trading system had 
chalked up $1.5 billion in notional transaction values since its launch on 
Nov. 1. 
Dynegydirect (www.dynegydirect.com) currently carries Dynegy's bid and offer 
prices for over 300 energy and energy-related products, including North 
American electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Coal, emission allowances and weather derivatives will be offered in the 
first quarter of 2001, with international energy products and 
telecommunications bandwidth following in the second quarter, Houston-based 
Dynegy said in a statement. 
Dynegydirect currently has over 400 registered users and Dynegy said that 
over $1 billion of the deals done to date over the system were generated by 
new customers for the company. 
In addition to its own portal, Dynegy has been trading on the Tradespark 
(www.trade-spark.com) multilateral online energy trading platform launched in 
September. 
Tradespark is backed by a partnership of several energy companies, including 
Williams Cos., TXU Corp. and privately owned Koch Industries. Dynegy has said 
it will join the partnership at a later date. 
Dynegy's home-town rival Enron Corp. is regarded as the frontrunner in online 
trading of wholesale energy products, with deals worth $183 billion 
transacted over its EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) system between November 
1999 and October 2000. 
Enron executives have said they also plan to use other online trading 
platforms to do business and will not focus exclusively on the company's own 
platform.
