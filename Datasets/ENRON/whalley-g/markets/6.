Just got a call from Hertzberg.
He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this weekend.
Too complicated; too rushed; he couldn't pull it off, but intends to  continue working with folks.
He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess, come back on the 20th, and try again.
Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison/energy issue, the focus will now be at the CPUC, which is scheduled to rule on a rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC, Direct Access suspension, etc. at its August 23rd meeting.

Best,
Jeff
