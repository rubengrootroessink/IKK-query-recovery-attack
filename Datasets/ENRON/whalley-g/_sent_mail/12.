you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.
