So who is the 48 year old fat guy that found it for you?  Your not fat, and
you ain't 48, YET!!  :)

Linda

P.S. Ben took the test and past it.  He is having the temporary license
faxed to Mark's office.

Hi guys:

I want you both to know that you should be totally embarrassed that the
48 year old fat guy found the web site on his own when you two could
not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The web site is:  www.boat-ed.com/tx/
Ben get on it right away so that you can ride the wave runners by
yourself!
Its going to be fun.
Congratulations on passing all of your classes.

See you in a couple of weeks!

	Swig
