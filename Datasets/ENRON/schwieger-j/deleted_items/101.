Hi,
Glad it went well.  We all need a bit of optimism right now!!!!!  Give me a call - I would be glad to be a sounding board!!!!
Again, I really admire your ability to "Lay" it on the line (do you get the pun?????) to management!!!!
Joan

Thanks for the nice things you have said over the last week.
Your knowledge of my personality provides me with a way to see if I'm going overboard

I met with Cindy Olson this morning !
They sincerely want to know what I think needs to be done to get employee confidence back!
I was not timid in my recommendations and I really think they had already thought through a lot of them!
I came out of it optimistic.
Cindy is supposed to get back to me hopefully Friday

I would like to talk to you about some of my ideas tonight.

Thanks,
Swig
