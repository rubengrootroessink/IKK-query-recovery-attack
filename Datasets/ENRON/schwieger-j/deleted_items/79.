Doing pretty well today.
Just got out of our every other monday staff meetings.
Nothing earth shattering!!

You're right.....the little things count.

Be good,

How are you today?
Things are OK down here!
Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

They continue to hate ENE!
It really makes me wonder?

Be Safe!
