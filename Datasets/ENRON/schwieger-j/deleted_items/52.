Schedule 6 came in for April 2001.   It shows we injected 49,072 mmbtus less than we had expected.  April total ENA was 6,447,933 mmbtus.  We had tickets written for 6,497,005 mmbtus.

The last day true-up for in May 2001 shows we injected 46,246 mmbtus less than we expected.   The total scheduled volume for the month was 6,068,754 mmbtus.   We had deals totaling 6,115,000 mmbtus.

Chris Price needs an injection price to complete his cost of inventory entry.  The file I usually e-mail is storage/stcpr051 and storage/stcpr041.  I believe these files were updated except for these last two adjustments.  I can't verify this since I do not have access enron files.

Thanks,
Kenny
