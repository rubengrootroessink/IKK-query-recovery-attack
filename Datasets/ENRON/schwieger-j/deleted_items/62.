Hello.

Good news!  Ben passed all of his classes...by the skin of his teeth, so he
is able to come to Houston.  :)

Ben and I both tried to find the web site about the wave runner license but
were unsuccessful.  Were you able to ask your friends?  Ben is now very
anxious to take the test so he can drive one of the wave runners.

Love,
Linda
