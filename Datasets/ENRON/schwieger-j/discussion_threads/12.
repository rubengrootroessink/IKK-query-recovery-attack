Jim, an update on unwind costs is as follows since 12/20 (for the value on 
the 19th):

1.  Interest rates decreased thus increasing the book value.  The value 
created by this is approx. $700,000.
2.  New origination of $950,000.

Last time our unwind costs totalled $202 mil and with these changes it is now 
$203.6.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dave


New Origination
