Welcome Back!
Mom said you weren't feeling so great all week because of your sinus
problems and a sore throat.  NO FUN!!  Hope you're better now.  If you are
at work today, you are probably swamped with things to catch up on.

You make it pretty hard to give you a thank-you.  I write you an e-mail
thanking you for great stuff you've done, and you come back with more stuff
to give us.  :)

Coming to Houston for the 4th of July sounds good to us.  WE APPRECIATE THE
OFFER TO PAY FOR AIRFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had been thinking of
renting a van to drive the whole way.

The tricky thing again this year is figuring out how to get Ben there.  He
has another church event the week of June 25th-July 2nd.  We thought about
having him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun
stuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and
then we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and
I leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary
help Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd.  Mark should be
able to take the whole week off.

The other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will
have to take summer school.  He has been told that if he flunks a class this
semester, he will have to retake it in summer school.  We won't know for
sure if he is going to flunk until the middle or end of May.  If he has to
take summer school, he will not go on the church event or come to Houston
with us because summer school is only offered the first part of June through
July 13th.  If reservations are made for Ben, we would not be able to use
it.  Let me know your thoughts.

I did look up information again about the educational IRA.  According to
page 27 of the 1040 instruction book, you cannot deduct contributions to an
educational IRA (just like you cannot deduct contributions to a Roth).

Mark and I haven't decided anything about the NE fund.

You probably realize this but the kids educational IRA's are not doing well.
Your $1,000 contribution is now down to $843.  I know you say for the long
run we shouldn't worry, but since Ben will graduate in 3 years, I'm
wondering if it is still the best place to be.  Let me know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

Linda:

Thanks for the note!
have you guys decided about the Nebr. Fund!
Your one previous "e" mail about the Education IRA bothers me.  Im not sure
if I replied to you or not, but you and Mark should be deducting the $1,000
( $500 for Ben & $500 for Anna) on your tax return.  Im not positive about
the deduction but there is something you need to fill out Im sure.  I can
not make the contribution myself because my income is over the limit
allowed.  That is why I deposit cash so it looks like you and Mark have
done it!  If you get a chance look into this for me for your 2000 taxes.

Don't worry about $$$$$$.  Like I told Mom money is not something the
Schieger Family should have to worry about for a long time.  The FORCE has
been good.
You just need to communicate with me!

The boys and I are leaving for Colorado to go skiing this Friday.  We will
be there until Saturday March 17.   Brent & Chad Daniel are going with us
so Josh & Jarrod will have company and I can relax.

I would like you & Mark to start thinking about the fourth of July this
year.  I thought it would be nice to give Donna a break and have everyone
down here this July.
I realize the fourth is on a Wednesday which might take some maneuvering
for Mark.  One idea is to take the whole week off as vacation and you guys
could stay at the lake house the whole week.  It would be like Minnesota
just alot warmer.  There would be a ski boat, two wave runners, fishing
etc.  If you are interested let me know as soon as possible.  I will pay
for the airfare for the four of you so the sooner you decide the more time
the travel agent has to find good deals.

Ya quite bitching about me paying for the airfare.  Get over it!

     Love Ya,   Swig

Just wanted to say thanks for all you do for us.  I think about it a lot, I
just don't tell you enough.

I really appreciate our van, knowing we paid so little for it.

I am very thankful for our windows, siding and roof, and knowing what a
deal
you have given us makes it even better.

It is comforting to know we will have some money for the kids education.

Etc. Etc. Etc.

Love and Hugs,

Linda
