Jim,
I got a notice from the dentist yesterday that Jarrod has a dental cleaning 
scheduled for February 28 at 4:30.  I have a doctors appointment that day at 
3:30 and cannot take him - can you?  If not, let me know and I'll reschedule 
his appointment.

Also, I am scheduled to have the boys the weekend of April 21-22, and would 
like to switch with you if possible.  Let me know what would work for you.  
Thanks,
Joan
