Gentlemen, I was hoping you could take just a few minutes of your time to 
input some information on Jody Crook.

I spoke with Jody recently about the possibility of doing his next rotation 
within Enron Global Markets, specifically in the LNG group.  Jody came across 
as a very energetic guy with the right disposition for the type of deals we 
are currently working on (mostly long term origination type work with a good 
dose of assett based development) and based on that I feel there is a good 
chance we could make him an offer.

Before doing so though, I was hoping you could give me some feedback on 
Jody's performance in your group;  what is he responsible for, what are his 
strengths/ weaknesses etc.  I don't need extreme detail, just enough that I 
can get a feel for what you think I can expect out of him.

I appreciate your help.  E--mail is fine but if you just want to give me a 
call I'm at ext. 56249.

Thank you


Doug Arnell
