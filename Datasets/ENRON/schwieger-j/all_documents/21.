To all:

Please find a draft of the strategy presentation requested by Dave and John 
at our meeting on Tuesday.  I have also attached an email describing a 
potential tax liability on the Cushion Gas.  Lets discuss these at our 
meeting planned for 1:00 Wednesday.  We can meet in my office 3566.

Jim, the cost/volume numbers in the presentation need some work and the 
accounting treatment may be off as well - can you revise and bring to the 
meeting?

Tim/Tom/Jim, FYI, Comments?  You are welcome to attend or can get updated 
afterwards.

Regards,
Brian

All,

The huge tax hit relates to Cushion gas only.  For working gas (non cushion), 
the tax liability is normal course of business (ie Sales Price - Inventory 
Cost).  Due to the age of the cushion gas the TRRC is allowing us to only 
deduct our original basis which was $0.33/mmbtu per our tax records.  There 
is a possiblity of reducing this slighty if the write-up of the cushion gas 
occurred after Dec 1989, but we will have to find documentation of such and I 
do not believe this will provide substantial savings.  For our purposes we 
are looking at being charged interest and penalites on the tax due from $2.90 
- $0.33.  This will be slightly less than the $1.1 million which was 
calculated from the full value of $2.90, but not significantly less.

I return from Chicago tomorrow and should be back in by lunch.  Call if you 
have any questions.

Currently from what I understand the tax hit would be a little over $1million 
and is accruing interest.

Brian, I'm sure that you are aware of the disappointing result that appears 
to be the outcome of the TXRRC Tax  Audit...I think we need to converse about 
the tax ramifications of the sale of the non-cushion gas to AEP and the 
unwind from the Banks..........If the strict approach currently being 
employed is applied to 1. the unwind (with the conveyance  to LEASECO) and 
also 2. the sale of this non-cushion gas by Leaseco to HPL, IT SEEMS TO ME 
THAT ENRON WILL HAVE A HUGE TAX HIT. Maybe we can slightly change the 
mechanics to avoid this result. Let me have your thoughts. 

regards bng
