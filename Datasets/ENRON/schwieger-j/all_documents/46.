Jim,
David and I wanted to let you know that Phillip has broken his arm over the
weekend and he will be out of sports for a while.  He has an appt with an
orthopedic surgeon on Friday and we should know more after that with regards 
to
exactly how long he has to be in a cast.  Needless to say, Phillip is very
disappointed.  We will keep you posted.

Thanks,
David and Carolyn Warnick
