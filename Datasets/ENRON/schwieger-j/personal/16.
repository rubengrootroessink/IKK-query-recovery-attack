OK Coaches and other concerned  people,
 
Here is the latest update on  reschedules.  But first, I apologize for trying to reschedule 4 games at  one field on one night.  This is the correction of that mess and most of  the other messes in the reschedule.  There are two games on the list that  have not been rescheduled yet but they are on the list to let you know that I  know that it needs to be done.
 
Now, what I need from you is scores that  have not been called in and I need future scores called in on time.  It's  getting late in the season I need information on a timely basis.  I don't  want to enforce the 24 hour rule, but some of you are waiting a week or  more.  After tomorrow, if you wait a week or more to call in a score you  will forfeit the game.  Please help me get this stuff done on time as we  come to the close of the season.  I am working hard to make it so we can  end on time, but I can't do it without some help.  Currently I am missing  scores for games 1212, 1229, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238 and from teh Gray Div. 1067,  1070, 1100, 1136, 1141.  Thanks.
