Hi Jim. Here are some picture of the Daytona and the Daytona 2.  Also here
is a picture of a new Gauntlet legends game that I think your kids would
really enjoy.  It's a 4-player showcase cabinet that looks great.  We have
them at a special price of 2195.00 They were over 3500 when they first came
out.  I am assuming you want them all set on "free play".  You can email me
back.

Thanks,

Lutz
