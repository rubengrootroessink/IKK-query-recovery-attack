> SPRING 2001 POST SEASON
>
> Cy-Fair Sports Association is affiliated with two sanctioning
> organizations for the 2001 Spring Baseball Season. Our affiliation with
> Pony Baseball has been longstanding and affords the most competitive
> players in all age groups a chance to participate in post season
> tournaments.
> Our new affiliation with USSSA also offers post season play with a tiered
> format, and to some extent eliminates the various stages of competition
> required by Pony Baseball.
> The following is a brief description of the post season opportunities that
> all participants in CFSA Baseball may enjoy:
> POST SEASON PONY BASEBALL
> *	Divisions/Teams/Players that CFSA registered with Pony and that are
> eligible to participate
> 		Bronco Maroon Division
> 		CFSA Bronco Co-Op Teams

> 		Pony Maroon Division
> 		CFSA Pony Co-Op Teams
> 		Pre-High Division
> *	All-Star teams selected from league players using CFSA guidelines
> *	Maroon, Co-Op, and Triple A Teams were registered by CFSA and
> eligible
> *	Graduated advancement to higher levels of competition; District,
> Section, Regional, State, Zone, Nationals on a weekly basis (Similar to
> Little League)

> Baseball Commissioner.
> CFSA Triple A and Sunday Co-op Teams are automatically qualified for Pony
> tournaments. These teams must submit a roster by 2/24/01 that will remain
> frozen (for Pony purposes) until all division All-Star teams have been
> chosen. These teams may also play in the division Round Robin, but will
> not participate for seeding, nor are their players at risk in the draft.
> These teams must notify their Division Commissioners if they want to play
> in the Round Robin.
> Any situation not specifically addressed in the rules above may be ruled
> on by the Baseball Committee, whose decision will be final.

> POST SEASON USSSA BASEBALL
> This affiliation is offered so that every CFSA player (Age 9-16) might
> have an opportunity to play post season events. This association is
> primarily recognized as a tournament venue, and offers 3 distinct tiers of
> competition ( CFSA participates in 2; Double & Triple A).
> USSSA is different from Pony in that it provides tournaments during the
> season for teams to qualify for its World Series. Following are the
> methods a team can qualify.
> Win a World Series qualifying tournament (Typically there are 2 of these
> events during the spring season)
> Finish in the top 4 of the South Zone State tournament (Teams once
> qualified do not re-qualify, so more than 4 teams from the South Zone may
> advance to the World Series)
> CFSA/USSSA Post Season
> *	Double A: This level of competition is for teams who participate in
> the CFSA league and who are not on a Triple A League team. A player may be
> on a Sunday Co-op team and still be eligible to play on a Double A
> tournament team. USSSA will allow 1 berth to the State tournament for
> every 6 teams in a division. CFSA will award these berths to the top teams
> from the CFSA Playoffs. (Upper Bracket only).
> *	Triple A; This level of competition is for teams that participate in
> the CFSA Triple A league, or the Sunday Co-op league. USSSA will allow 1
> berth to the State tournament for each 4-6 teams in a division. CFSA will
> award these berths to the winner of the post season playoff.
> Once a team qualifies the roster is considered frozen, and players who
> wish to continue may not be cut from the team. USSSA recognizes that teams
> may lose players who choose not to continue playing and will allow teams
> to replace any lost player plus add an additional 3 players from any team
> within that CFSA league. Teams that do not get a CFSA sanctioned berth are
> still able to play in the USSSA tournaments, however they must register
> their own team.
