Coaches,

As you can see we are still in need of the volunteers for this years
tournament.  Please respond to me ASAP with the three names choices of your
volunteers.  Thanks,

Louis Martinez


Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.
