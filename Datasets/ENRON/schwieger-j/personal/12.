<FW: [Fwd: Fwd: The importance of typing your email
addresses correctly]>>
           
It seems there was this couple from Minneapolis who decided
to go to Florida for a few days to thaw out during this particularly
cold winter.
Since both spouses worked, they had difficulty coordinating their
schedules, so the decision was made to have the husband leave
for Florida on a certain day, with the wife following him one day
later.
The man made it down to Florida and arrived at his hotel.
Upon getting to his room, he decided to open his laptop and
send his wife back in Minneapolis an email. However, he left off one
letter in typing his wife's email address and sent the email off without
realizing his error.  
In another part of the country, a widow had just returned from the
funeral of her husband, a Methodist pastor of many years, who had
been called to glory just a few days earlier. She decided to check her
email because she was expecting to hear from her husband's relatives
and friends. Upon reading the first email, she let out a loud scream,
fainted and fell to the floor. 
The woman's son rushed into the room and found his
mother on the floor. He glanced up at the computer screen and saw
the following email message:

To My Loving Wife:
I've just been checked in. Everything has been prepared for your
arrival here tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then.

Your Devoted Husband.

P.S. Sure is hot down here.
