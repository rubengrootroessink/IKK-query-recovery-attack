We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College
Savings Plan.  We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad
it sounds.  Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on
YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you
give if you make big bucks).  The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus
.6% of earnings.  Anyway, we will look it over in more detail.  They do not
restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a
Nebraska resident to open up an account.   Josh and Jarrod could each have
an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and
when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate.

Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA.  It is similar to a
Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to
putting it into the account.  I don't list it anywhere on my income tax
forms until we start taking the money out.  In essence it is as if we are
putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right?

There is no school again today.  Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to
come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed.  They
have to make it up at the end of the school year.

Mom said your house on the lake is all done being remodeled.  Bet it looks
nice.

Have a great day!

Love,
Linda

Linda and Mark:
I would like you guys to decide what to do and let me know.  Ben and Anna
will more than likely go to Nebraska so it make sense.  We still have to
make the 2001 contribution so if you want me to send it to the Nebraska
fund let me know.

     Love,  Jim

Jim,

This was just passed by the Nebraska legislature, and thought it might be a
better plan than the educational IRA.

Let us know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

P.S. I worked on the Ameritrade "stuff" (Schedule D) some more.  Hopefully
I
plugged in the right #'s.  I might mail a copy to you just to be sure.  Too
bad we don't have a scanner here at home.
