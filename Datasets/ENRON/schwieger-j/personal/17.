Good Morning!
Hope your teeth aren't too sore today.  :)

Mark and I talked about when to come to Houston.

The ideal would be for the 3 of us (Mark, Linda, Anna) to fly down late
morning on Sat. the 30th.  Ben would need a late afternoon flight on Monday
July 2nd,(he is suppose to pull in from the bus at noon, so late afternoon
would give him some buffer time).  All 4 of us could fly back on Sunday July
8th, late morning or what ever is available.  We are flexible.

Thanks a bunch!!!!
We are looking forward to a great visit.

Love and Hugs,
Linda
