Hi Jim,

The dimensions for the game are 68lx81Hx75.5w The Daytona twin is $4,999 for
both units and 4295 for the Daytona 2 single seat. I originally quoted you
44-4500 for the Daytona and was reading off the wrong line, I apologize for
that.  To ship the Galaga/Ms Pacman is 275 to your door.  Keep in mind that
the units breakdown and should fit through a 34 - 36 door.

Thanks,

Lutz
