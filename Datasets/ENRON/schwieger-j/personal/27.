Hey gang, just wanted to drop everyone a note and wish you a happy memorial day - summer is here and Grenada is
just around the corner.  I suggest we all try to pick a day in June to get together.  We need to decide if we want to
sign up for a tour with Mandoo and on what day (not you Jim since you are coming in Saturday night!).

Anyway, email me back and let me know what day would be good for you for happy hour and if you want to sign up
for a tour on Friday or Saturday in Grenada or just wing it on our own!

Later,
Kim
