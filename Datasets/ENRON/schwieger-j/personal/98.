Hi Jim,
Here's another thought on games.  If you get our Ultracade system you'll get
24 games installed and a new cabinet for 3599.99.  Any word on the Galaga or
Daytona?  Here's a link to it:
http://www.arcadeequipmentwarehouse.com/Ultracade/ultracade.html also look
through our used video list, it hasn't been updated recently but most of
what's on there is still available.  It shows we have 3 sets of Daytona's
available but we only have one and one Daytona 2 set.  Also we currently
have 2 of the Galaga/Pacman games in stock.
Let me know,
Lutz
