Thank you for confirming to me your Email address.  Here is the 2nd attempt - 
I am sorry you did not receive this info the first time.  I will send the 
physical backup to your home address per our phone conversation today.

Thanks again!

Per your conversation with Pat Dowd, please find attached two versions of the 
performance figures for your accounts.  We ran the return numbers two ways; 
Sheet 1 was calculated by subracting the ending balance from the beginning 
balance, (less deposits and withdrawals) then divided by the beginning 
balance.  Sheet 2 was calculated by dividing the earnings by the total 
investment.  You'll also find the historical performance of the indices that 
you requested at the end of each sheet.

Feel free to modify the sheets to fit your needs - let us know if you require 
any further information.  I will forward you the physical backup (statements, 
etc) to follow.

Happy Thanksgiving!
