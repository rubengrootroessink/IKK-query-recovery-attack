Jim,

Sorry I didn't get this back to you sooner.  These are the scenarios that are in the spreadsheet:  Consistent Volume in the ground,  Withdraw in December instead of January, and Withdraw in January instead of December.  Let me know if you need anything else, or if you want to go over it.  

Bryan
