All,

The working gas that was sold to AEP on June 1, 2001  was Enron / HPLC's working gas only.  This did NOT include any amounts of gas owned by any other third parties that had storage in the Bammel facility.  This volume of gas was an estimate based upon the best available information.  What will happen is that when the actual meter statment information is received we will either refund or request payment for the difference between the estimate and actual volumes.

Any claims that we billed AEP for volume that belonged to third parties is erroneous.  Call with any questions.
