Greg:
Sorry, I did not get back with you earlier but I was on vacation.
This looks fine to me!
Hopefully you sent this out and were not waiting for me to get back to you!

Jim,
From our discussions and the follow up work by John Griffith, attached please find a draft proposal for an exchange of gas with MidCon Texas.

Please let me have your comments.  

Thanks,
