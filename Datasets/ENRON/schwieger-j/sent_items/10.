Jim, I believe you forgot to attach your revised document.  Thanks for your kind comments.

Sarah:
I think you have done a great job on the article.  I know the Weather Group will appreciate the comments.  I did make a few changes and saved them as the same document with a "_Schwieger" behind it.  I have no pride of ownership and Im not a writer so do with it as you see fit!

	Thanks,   Jim Schwieger

OK, here's an initial draft of your Enron Business article.  Please review and return your comments to me as soon as possible.  The deadline for changes is noon on Wednesday.

Mike: please be sure that everyone quoted has a chance to review their quote.  Also, one more question: who is the female in the photo shoot -- you just told me there were no female meteorologists!

 

Thanks, guys, for taking the time to meet with me.  I enjoyed writing this one.

Warm regards,
Sarah.
