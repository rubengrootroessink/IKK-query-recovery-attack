Hi There!

I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
I went to New Orleans last weekend.
It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
It was a nice feeling!

Are we still on for Wednesday night?
It still works for me!

I hope all is well!
	Swig

Thanks !  I knew it was short notice.
The big ol 35 -- but you can say 28.
Next Wednesday sounds good to me - let's plan on it.
What do you think of all this Enron stuff ?

Happy Birthday!
Sounds like a fun time.
I have a dentist appt out by the house at 4:00 pm so I will have to opt for dinner next week!
Hope you have a fun night celebrating your ah? 28 birthday, right?
Call when you figure out what's good for you.  Wednesday looks best for me right now.

	Swig

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?
