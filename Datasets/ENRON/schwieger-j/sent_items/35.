Subject:	Bammel Gas Compressor Cost Projection

The attached schedule is my projection of Bammel Injection activity through the remainder of 2000.  This is an estimate as of today March 5, and will change as the futures curve changes.  The schedule also includes a Fuel Percentage Table that I would recommend using in the future to determine the fuel percentage to be utilized at different Gas In Place levels.  

It is my understanding that all Electric Compressor Cost will be charged to a separate location each month and the Storage Book will credit that location with the calculated gas compressor costs on a monthly basis.   Please let me know if this is your understanding and if the Fuel Percentage Table recommended above is OK with you!
