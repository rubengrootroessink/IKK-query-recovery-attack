Vin:

The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know!
Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years.
Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.  I believe Pat should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001)

I hope this is what you were looking for?
