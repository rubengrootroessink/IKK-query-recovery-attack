Yes, all withdrawals for Centana should be in the same month (May).  If we don't have a deal ticket for the additional April injections Kenny please prepare one for my signature.

	Thanks,  Jim

Your deals are correct.  We need to write a new deal ticket for March 2001 since we injected an additonal 21,640 mmbtus.  The total was 193,050 according to scheduling.  We need to find out if Tom wants us book the withdrawal of this additional gas in May like the rest of the withdrawals.  We are still injecting in April.  We also need to find out if he wants us to write another assumption for April's injections.

I have a different # for Spindletop.  I have two deals.  One at 26590 mmbtus and the other at -198000 for a total of 171410 injection.  Is the 26590 fuel?  They are on the same ticket.

Please send me the detail for March storage assumptions.  The assumptions should equal 7,863,146 mmbtu.  You should also have ProductionTax deals.  The Prod. Tx should net to zero.
Thanks,
Kenny
