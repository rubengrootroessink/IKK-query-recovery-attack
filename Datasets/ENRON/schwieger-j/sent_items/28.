Nick & Brad:

What is the status of the MidCon Flagstaff Meter Station?  As contemplated HPL is having a difficult time delivering Entex volumes into MidCon during the cold weather Houston has been experiencing.  Given changes in MidCon's system this situation will probably continue to be a challenge throughout the winter.  This problem is compounded by the start up of the Nov. - Feb. deliveries to MidCon of 83,334 MMBtu/d.  All of our eggs seem to be collecting in the Flagstaff Meter Station so its imperative that this station be operational ASAP.  Please provide me with an update!
