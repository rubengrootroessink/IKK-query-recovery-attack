Irene / Tom:

All of the contracts below can be terminated except for:
	Texas General Land Office
	Cannon Interest - Houston
	Enron North America  (I assume this will terminate with the sale.
There has not been any activity on the rest for a couple of years.
Kenny would you please check to see if any of the contracts to be terminated have any residual balances and get with the appropriate individuals to clear up ASAP.

	Jim
