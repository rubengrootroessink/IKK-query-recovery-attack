Thanks for the way you wrote this letter!  It gets to the point, yet does not imply anything other than a search for an explanation.

If measurement is correct, this will cause the texas desk to inject 235,182 mmbtu's more in March than they expected.  Is there any way we can come up with a better explanation than the field estimates were wrong?  We need to assure commercial that the cause for the discrepancy is explanable and correctable.
Let me know if the cause for the incorrect field estimates can be determined.
Thanks,
Kenny

As you know, Commercial's expectations are derived from estimates.  I have rechecked the data with Measurement and it has been determined that the EFM data is correct and no adjustments will be made.  It is believed the estimates were entered wrong from the field.

It seems the variance between commercial's expectation and measurement has not been resolved.  Please let me know what caused this variance.  The variance needs to be resolved ASAP since accounting has to close its books for March.
Thanks,
Kenny

Check it out.  This is a very high variance.  I will need an explanation before I tell commercial.
Thanks,
Kenny

Earl, here is the schedule.

 

Kenny, there is a variance of 178,259 this month.  Earl will review the schedule to verify my info.  Please let me know if I need to do anything to bring this variance down.  Thanks
