The sky is falling! The sky is falling! 
Oh, never mind that's just Enron stock price!
It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!
