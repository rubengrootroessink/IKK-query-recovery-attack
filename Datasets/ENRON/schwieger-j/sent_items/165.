John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss=
ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o=
f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution=
.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t=
ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str=
uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations =
of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=
f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr=
on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde=
d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h=
ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa=
irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan=
 so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s=
olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny =
an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un=
der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of =
the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!
