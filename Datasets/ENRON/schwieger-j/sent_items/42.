MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Have you reached an agreement within your shop about the location of the
second
interconnect between the two companies?
