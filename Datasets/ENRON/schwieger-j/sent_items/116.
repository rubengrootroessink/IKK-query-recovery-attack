I'm in a really sour mood.
I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time!
I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
It's the "pits"
I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.
I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things.
My excuse is that I'm always exhausted
I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this.
I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!
 
ENE is down $1.42 right now!
No news that I know of?
The DOW is down (113) right now.
It appears that things may be escalating in Afghanistan.
I think the Special Forces are close.
 
Have fun at Jackson Hole!
Miss Ya!
