Please let me know if you are interested in getting a flu shot this Wednesday (see below).  I'll compile the info of who is/is not interested, and then forward it to Ina.

Thanks,
Laura

I have scheduled the Health Center to come and administer flu shots to our floor on Wednesday.  I need to have an approximate number of how many vaccines we will need.  Please ask within your groups today and see who will be interested and let me know.

Thank You,
