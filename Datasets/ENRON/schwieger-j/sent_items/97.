Sorry about not returning your call this morning!
I was trying to finish my questions for the All Employee meeting!  
Like it made any difference!
They would not address any of my questions.
What made it worst is I can not believe how STUPID the general Enron employee population is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind!
I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!!
I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone!  Except you of course!

lets talk tonight.
Jarrod has a 6:00 pm ball game, but I do not think we are going!

Thanks, for calling!

How are you this morning?
Are you listening to the investor conference call?
Are you going to the employee meeting?

You need to let me know when you have regular scheduled meetings so i'm not calling at those times.
When does nymex open and close?

I could tell you were in a meeting when i called this morning. It also sounded like you are sick. Are you???

Not too much going on up here, just the usual pissed off customers yelling at me!

Hope all is well.

Mike
