Hi Jim,

The shipping quote to your door is 269.00/game. There was know price break
on two or more because they had to be but on individual pallets.  Here are
some pictures of what I have available in the classic games. I almost forgot
to tell you.  We have a brand new gauntlet Legends 4 player in a dedicated
Cabinet available for only 2,195.00 this game was 3995 new a year ago.  It
is brand new and never been used.  It's a great buy if you like action
adventures games.  I think your kids will like it.  Also 4 players can play
at the same time.  It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret
doors.  We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League
City, TX is going to get one.  Also would you want us to set them on free
play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.  It's your
choice.  It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg

Let me know if you have made any decisions

Thanks,

Lutz
