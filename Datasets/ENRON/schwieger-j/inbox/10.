Jim, how far back would you like to make adjustments?  Here is a spreadsheet that compares what we booked vs. what is on Sch 6.  The net of this analysis is that we have withdrawn more on our schedule vs. Sch 6.  In the end, if we make all of these adjustments, it would result in 21,259 adjustment.

Dave
