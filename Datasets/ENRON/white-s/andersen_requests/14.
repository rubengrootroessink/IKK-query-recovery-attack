calculation
of correlation factors, off-peak trading, liquidity of portfolio, etc.

performance,
results of inadequate performance, bonus determination process.

3.   Organizational Structure

4.   Overall Market/ Newly Traded Markets
?    Traders? assessment of the overall market, including most active regions,
liquidity of peak versus off-peak positions, new markets, etc.

monthly or quarterly basis.

surrounding deal capture, valuation, management reporting, and financial

not
change for ancillary     services.
