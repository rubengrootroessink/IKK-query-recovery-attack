Stacey,

Per my voicemail, in reviewing the documentation provided by Marilyn she
noted that for three deals the trade date was before the deal entry date.
Please provide an explanation as to why the trade date is prior to the deal
entry date for the following deals:

      514141.2
      536771.2
      568025.1

Please provide the following:

   Forwards detail for NSTAR
   Liquidations report for NSTAR
   Query for longest dated deals

In addition, in reviewing the leg count of total deals by type provided  by
Casey, we noted that no transmission deals were included.  Do we have a
complete listing of deal types?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.

Thank you,

Jennifer
