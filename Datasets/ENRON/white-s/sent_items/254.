Dear Stacey,

	We can have Min take a look at how much work it takes and then go from there.

	Regards,


Norman.

I'm anticipating a request for trader stats very shortly here. Problem is that we laid off my excel wiz ?. Any chance one of you would have an excel wiz sitting around that would like to get cranking on perf reports?
