Parameters!!!

Three aspiring psychiatrists were attending their first
class on emotional extremes.  "Just to establish some
parameters," said the professor, to the student from
Arkansas, "What is the opposite of joy?"
"Sadness,"  said the student.
"and the opposite of depression?"  he asked of the young
lady from Oklahoma.
"Elation,"  she said.
"And you sir," he said to the young man from Texas,
"How about the opposite of woe?"
The Texan replied, "Sir, I believe that would be  giddy up."
