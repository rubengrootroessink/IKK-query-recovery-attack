Have them go through accounting.  This is non-trading expenses.  Not our area unless it runs through the DPR.

Subject: more questions from AA


Stacey:

Jennifer from AA is inquiring about the $7.5 MM she saw on ENA 3rd Quarter 2001 Detail of Expenses.  She noticed that these expenses are related to trading (Belden)- legal & bank fees.  

Tim is in Houston for the rest of the week and will be back next Monday.  Should I suggest AA to check with Accounting (Tracy Greene) on this item or should I try to contact Tim directly?

Please advise.  

Thank you,
Fran

Fran,

The $7.5 million is depicted on the ENA 3rd Quarter 2001 Detail of
Expenses.  We received this schedule in conjunction with the Management

Thanks for your help.

Jennifer:

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L
of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book)
agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore
essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deal in our
LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me
know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.

Thanks,

Fran

Fran,

In reviewing the Management Summary, we had the following questions:

1.  We noted that $14.8 million P&L related to Middle Market
Originations
(Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals?
2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading
(Belden)-
legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings
release
is quickly approaching, we would appreciate your prompt assistance.

Thank you,
Jennifer
