Hi Dave, 

Yes, you are right, I just changed that intentionally in the second request, just to hope that the request doesn't go to you before it got approved by her. It seems like this still went to you even before she approved it.

Stacey, 

So should I have put you or Dave as the primary approver for my request? 

Thanks, 
Samantha

Samantha, 

Looks like this one went to Stacey, with me as her backup. 
You might want to ask Stacey who should be primary/secondary approver for your requests. 

Thanks, d.n.
