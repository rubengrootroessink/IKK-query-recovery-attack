Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties.  If you want me to add comments, send them to me and I will incorporate.

Thanks,

David,
Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

Thanks,
Stacey
