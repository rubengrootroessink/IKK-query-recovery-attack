John,

Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

Thanks,
Stacey
