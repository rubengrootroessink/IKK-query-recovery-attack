Wasn't sure if you had heard anything about Donnie testing for EES and EnPower.  I am not sure there is anything we need to do, just wanted to keep you in the loop.

I have put the following test deals in the PWRTESTP environment.  Everything on my side looks good.  The secondary legal entity is populating in all cases and the entry is correct.

666068.01  Deal Blotter 
666069.01  Deal Blotter 
666070.01  Deal Blotter 
666153.01  Deal Entry 
666154.01  Deal Entry Swap   This is also a case where EES is the primary and EPMI is the secondary.  This should not occur but I wanted to test whether it would work if a deal were entered.

666156.01  Deal Entry 
666157.01  Deal Entry 


Please test the effects on your downstream systems, as well as forward this e-mail to anyone I have forgot.  Also e-mail me back at your earliest convenience to give me a status report from your area.
