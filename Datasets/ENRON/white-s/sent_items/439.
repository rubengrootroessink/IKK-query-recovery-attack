Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  

I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.

I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.

Subject:	update on a couple of things

Just wanted to give you an FYI on a couple of things. I am planning to meet with everybody on a one on one basis in the next week to do a quarterly review. I was planning to revisit their mid year reviews and talk about how they have progressed or not, projects they have worked on and how they went,  long term plans, etc. I think it is even more pressing for Heather because of the way the Renewables was handled. I figured since I went through the process with Emissions, I had a pretty good insight on what I wanted her to do, so I laid out the groundwork for her. Didn't go as I had planned so I wanted to use the opportunity to get her back on track.


Regarding coming to Houston a little more often, I would like to try and come maybe every 4 - 6 weeks if that doesn't blow your budget up. Obviously it depends on ticket prices, but I am learning that while it is ok to communicate over the phone with various groups, it doesn't beat being face to face and looking at the same reports and interacting a little more efficiently. As I said, I was only in the office for 2 days but I could have spent a week there getting work done and meeting with people. It would also give me a chance to meet with Jill Vogelfang a little more. I met with her, last Thursday and it was a good meeting.

By the way, have you heard any more about the PC video conferencing?

John
