meone out on Friday, please make sure they pack before they leave or you ha=
ve someone pack their stuff for them.  Please make sure that everyone clean=
s out their desk completely.  I know that boxes are hard to find right now.=
  If any of you know that you will need quite a few boxes for your groups, =
please let me know ASAP so I can have them delivered by Thursday .  I know =
that there are some boxes on floor 4 in the South building, so you might wa=
nt to just go grab some.  Labels hopefully will be here Friday morning.  On=
ce I get them I will immediately pass them out.  I have attached the floor =
plan for the 6 th floor for those of you that want to know where your group=
