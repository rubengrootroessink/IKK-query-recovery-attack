Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Thanks,
Stacey
