Subject:	RE: EPMI List of Non-terminated parties: East Power
Importance:	High

The attachment reflects updates reviewed this afternoon arising out of additional credit war room files. Please note that the following counterparties should now be considered to have terminated their wholesale power enabling agreements with EPMI, and performance under any transactions with such parties, if any, should cease: 

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC, 
CP&L, 
OG&E, and 
Southern Illinois Power Cooperative.    

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

Please contact me with any questions, or additional information you may obtain.  David Portz (ext 39239)
