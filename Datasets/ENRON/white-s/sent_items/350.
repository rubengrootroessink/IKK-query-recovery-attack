Sorry I haven't responded very timely.  Things have been hectic at work.  I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Russell said you would be in around 6-7, is this right?  What kind of food do you want to eat, Russell suggested a Mexican food place, is this o.k. with you?

Stacey

Hey!  Just wanted to say thanks for the  Birthday Card.  Also, sorry we didn't get to see each other over the  weekend.  I was so excited because I was actually going to be able to give  you Fortune's Rocks back!  Can you believe I finished it?  It only  took me 3 months!  Now I am reading your To Tame a Texan's Heart.  So  maybe I will have it finished by the next time we see each other.
 
Have y'all seen any good movies  lately?  We went for my birthday and saw Don't Say a Word.  Couldn't  decide between that or Training Day.  Should have seen Training Day.   I was disappointed in the other one.  Of course Lamar said "I told you  so".
 
Well, I will let you go.  Take  care.
 
Love,
Karyn
