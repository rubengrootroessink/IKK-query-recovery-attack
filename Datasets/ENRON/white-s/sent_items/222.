Thanks for the offer, I have a Dr's appt.  Maybe later this week.

Mid C is R9, but WSCC-N is R8.  A 'B' indicates a basis curve which WSCC-N is not.

Have you talked to Bruce from Chase re: these files?

I thought Mid C was R9 and WSCC-N was B8?
Thank you for your help.
Evidently they are looking at removing BPA deal, and we wanted to understand the changes in VAR because of it.

Attached is the file you are trying to reconcile, which I've already reconciled.  Reconciled is New file.1,  Old file is EnronVarcurveshift II

Care to grab lunch?

Yes, I can get BPA volumes.  What is it for?

What is the curve code for WSCC-N

Also, do you have the breakdown for BPA volumes by peak and non-peak and reference date?


Thanks
