Eric/Jim:

	I am trying to answer the question below as it relates to certain receivables purchased by Sequoia. 

	I am having someone identify the Sequoia receivables from a rather large database [HOUPOW and HOUGAS] of gas/power receivables; however, I need to be able to identify exactly when the receivable was paid by our counterparty. If you are not the correct person to speak with, could you tell me who is?  Thanks.  JNE

The first question is, as of the relevant dates (November 29, December 2,
December 11, and for completeness, all intervening dates) did Sequoia,
Cherokee or EFP have assets other than Enron receivables? If so what were
they, down to particular receivables, and what was done with any proceeds
thereof?  For the purpose of this question and the proposed stipulation,
ignore EFP assets that have nothing to do with Sequoia.  If the answer is,
"on November 29 there were receivables in ______ (identify entity) that
resulted in subsequent collections of $_____ (amount) on _____ (date),
where were the proceeds deposited?  If in an Enron account commingled with
other funds, segregation may not apply.  If segregation applies, then the
DIP lenders may or may not need to consent.

Also, please look at the description in the stipulation of information to
be provided and advise if it accurately describes what we have already
delivered.  If not, please advise regarding any discrepancies.

Thanks.

Travis/Martin: can we agree to segregate and hold cash in trust, given the
DIP financing document?

Julia:  do we need approval of the cash committee internally before
executing? The creditors committee?

NOTE: amount at issue here is about $14,000,000.

True to form, Kelley Drye sent the form of stipulation and order last night
and want to submit it today.  Don't worry about the timing request, but I
would like your comments, particularly as to the paragraphs regarding what
we have or will deliver.  As for the segregation paragraph, all we agreed
to segregate were Sequoia assets.  I need to understand what is in the
other entities, if anything, before I tell them to stick it or agree
because we don't care.
