I am waiting for an answer back from Elizabeth, but was wondering if you or any of your contacts might know the answer to the following.
 
Thanks,
Stacey

One question:  I had Melissa Murphy put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me.  If a termination date is 12/4/2001, do I move 12/4 forward to the bankrupt book or do I move 12/5 forward to the bankrupt book?
 
Thanks,
Stacey

Thanks Stacey for all the hard work in putting this together- this list is great.  I  met with the East group today and the West group on Tuesday to review.  We may have questions but  .... thanks again.

The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.  If there are other counterparties that you know of that have not appeared on these lists, let me know and we will move them to the 'Bankruptcy Portfolio' we have set up.

<<Non-Terminated Counterparties as of 12-7-2001.xls>> <<Financial Power Terminated.xls>> <<Physical Power Terminated.xls>> 

Please let me know what other details you need and we will be happy to provide. 

Thanks,
