Subject:	RE: "Best Practices" Meeting - Tuesday, Feb. 5

 I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:

1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) . 

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of "Unify" for instance, will be too broad.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally
