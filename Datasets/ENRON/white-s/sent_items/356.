I was incorrect about Alberta ENA, it should be zero but where is Alberta?  It should have a big position.

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom
