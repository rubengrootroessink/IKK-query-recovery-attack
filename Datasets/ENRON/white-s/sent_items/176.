As of now I should have no employees on the Estate list.  Israel Estrada was on the list previously, but we have moved him to Power Global Rates in Netco.

I know we have all been worring about the Netco list.  

Can you please send me who you think is still here and on the estate list.

I just want to check my lists.  (Maybe I can get a job as Santa next year check lists).

thanks
