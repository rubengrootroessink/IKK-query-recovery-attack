I really am in the dark re: Hanson.  If you could make the rounds then we might have a better idea if Donnie should be there.  If Scotty does not know all the particulars (and Jeff does) I am not sure that the 9:30 PST meeting will be effective.  I basically just want some answers!

I believe Jeff cannot make the meeting tomorrow at 9:30 local. I know we meet at 8:30 local should we have jeff and Scott sit in at 8:30 and just meet separately after? Did you want Donnie at the meeting? Of course I am speculating not knowing anything about whether Scott can make it or not.
