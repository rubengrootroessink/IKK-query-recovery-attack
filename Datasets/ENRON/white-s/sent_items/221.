Just wanted to make sure you had the latest files of terminated counterparties.

Subject:	west bankruptcy deals

John:

So far I know we have three lists going around associated with moving west deals to the bankruptcy portfolios:
   
The first list is what I got from you => we added the deal comments together.
The second list is from Casey => Sam and I changed the deal termination dates in each deal 
The third list is from Will Smith => Will Smith changed the deals listed from the original desk to the bankruptcy desk

However, I am not sure if these three lists together provide the whole picture of what we have done so far.  Per Stacey's instructions, after we changed the termination dates, I exported ad hoc for the bankruptcy and west portfolios and found below issues:
 
a. some counterparties showing up in the bankruptcy portfolio are listed in any one of the above three files.  Please see this attachment and look at those not highlighted in yellow.
 
b. for some counterparties we still have deals in the days after the termination date.  Please see this attachment and look at those highlighted in orange and red.
 
* AQUILA: please check out deal # 656568 and # 569156.  According to Will Smith's list, the termination date for AQUILA should be 11/30/01.  However these two deals are not changed accordingly.
* ELPASOMERLP: according to the termiation dates list (from Casey), are we terminating all deals with this cp on 12/3/01?  If yes there are a bunch of deals left unchanged in the west portfolio for the rest of the month.  For example, #883630 has volumes for 12/4/01-12/31/01 under STNW desk.  There are many more deals like this.  Please search in deal entry to see all.
* Same case for MORGAN.  Example # 884431.1 in which we have volumes for all December 01' but according to the termination dates list, the termination date for this counterparty should be 12/7/01
* SMUD: please check deal# 647957.  This financial swap is still as it has been, i.e. under LTCA book for Q2 02'.  But according to Will Smith's list, the termination date for the counterparty should be 11/30/01?

If you could please help me look at this I will appreciate it very much.

Thanks,
Fran

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.
