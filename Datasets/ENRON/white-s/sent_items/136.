Dear All,

	Due to the migration of the EnPower database this coming Friday, we will have to create new database connection settings on each of your PC, could you please send me a list of the Windows Network User ID and Password, so that Min and I will be able to work on those PCs over the weekend.

	Thanks,


Norman.
