Jason,

I am aware of the risk being taken regarding the old Sun machines moving to the new building.  Specifically, they may not work once taken out of commission.  I am also willing to take this risk and request that the current machines the power risk group operates on should accompany them to the new building.

Thanks,
Stacey
