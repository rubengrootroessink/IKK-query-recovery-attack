Below is an updated list of recent contract terminations.  I believe we need to review our internal notification system to make sure this information gets distributed in a more timely fashion.

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Call David Portz at 3-9239 with questions.
