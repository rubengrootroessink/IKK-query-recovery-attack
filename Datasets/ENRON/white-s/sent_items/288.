Attached is a template we will be using to identify all pre-petition creditors that are critical to our operations.  This will allow these creditors to be paid.  Payment to such creditors must meet the following criteria in order to be considered "critical":  (1) payments must make sound business and operational sense; (2) payments must be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor.

The "critical" status of these vendors will need to be approved by Kerry and George Wasaff (head of the cash committee).

Jenny, we already have your list. 

Thanks, 
Mike
