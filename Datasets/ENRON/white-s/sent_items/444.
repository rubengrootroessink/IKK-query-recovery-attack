Hello all,
This notice is specifically for our Houston based EnPower Day to Day users.  The Day to Day team will be testing apps on the Power Trading Floor (6th Floor) in Enron Center South on Thursday, October 19, 2001.  Our current plans are to begin testing at 10:00 AM culminating at 12 Noon.  If any of you who have a desire to do any testing in the new building, please send an email to either me, or Bill Crooks.  Your coordination efforts should be finalized with Julie Hacker, X5-7895.

Thank you,
Karen Y. Martin
