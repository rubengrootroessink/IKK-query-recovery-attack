Subject:	risk books for December

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa
