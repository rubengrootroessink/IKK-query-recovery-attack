Cost Center 103823 should have 6% allocated to West Power (not 13%) and 94% allocated to East Power.

Thanks,
Stacey

Is this the Energy Ops schedule you are referring to?

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we can provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at the cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lower level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a further allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later we can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is preliminary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaking it out.

Thanks,

Kevin
