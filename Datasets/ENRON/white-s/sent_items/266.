Subject:	reports need to be restored

Dear Stacey and Fran:

  Both of you have asked me to restore some portcalc reports, some of the request was due back to even early this year.  I submitted all those request to the Unix team, but due to what happened to the company recently, apparently things are not kept in track very well and some people who used to work on the restoration has left without leaving a clear status notification.  

  I was asked by the Unix group to put together all the reports that still need to be restored and submit it to them again.  I'm wondering if you can provide me with a current list.   

  I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to do this, but I think by putting together a complete list and getting rid of those we no longer need, we can get things done in the shortest time.

  Thanks a lot.
