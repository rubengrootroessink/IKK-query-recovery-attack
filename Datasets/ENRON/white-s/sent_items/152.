Here is the latest results from our valuation engine.  Please let me know if you see any mistakes.  We will update with your newest changes tomorrow, so you can exclude those from your evaluation.  I also noticed that their is a financial UI transaction.  I believe this was just an oversite and have asked Casey to look into it.

Thanks,
Stacey
