Please start the following task in the morning:

Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk:
Constellation 
Energy Authority
Sempra Energy Trading
Public Service of Colorado

I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.

Thanks,
Stacey
