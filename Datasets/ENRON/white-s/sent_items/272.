Norman & Zhiyun,

Please see the bottom of this e-mail for the original values given to Andrea for this exercise.  At the time, we had not broken out East & West and only had a total value.  My issue is that the original values do not tie to the values were are seeing today.  Just to be sure, the calcs we are running should include all Sempra deals killed on or after Saturday, Dec. 1.  Can you please advise as to which numbers are correct.

Thanks,
Stacey

Is this including east and west? Is there a way to recalc the value of all the Sempra deals killed since Friday as of close of business Friday, and as of close of business Monday?

Give me a call if you want to talk before we do this.

ThankS,

Debbie

Debbie,

Are you comfortable with these numbers, and if you plug them in, what is our final mark?

Dave
