Go ahead and decline. She is in San Fran but another guy I talked to said she wanted to pull prices from a database source. That is nothing to do with the M drive.

Can you or someone else ask her why she requested m:\common\power Read/Write?

I know she is the fundamentals group here, but none of the folders in the path below would be used by her.

Why would this person need Read/Write to m:\common\power  I typically only grant access for Write capabilities to Risk.
