Melissa,

I was told that Grant County was also terminated and is on Kim's list, but I have not seen it on our updated master power list.  Can you let me know the status of this counterparty.

Thanks,
Stacey

Stacey/Casey,

There is only one new counterparty on the attachment above.  Please note all trades with TXU Electric have been terminated except for the three deals listed on the spreadsheet.

Thanks,
Melissa
