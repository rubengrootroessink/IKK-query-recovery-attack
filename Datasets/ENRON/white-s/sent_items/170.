That would be fine. 503-287-0052 or I can come in. Either way works.  Earlier the better for me.

They are rotating one person out a day starting Monday.  We will not be setting up the West books.  I would like to meet with you and Casey Monday morning if possible.  You can still be at home as long as we can call you.

When did you want to meet with Casey and I regarding how we will proceed going forward, i.e. new books, system set up, etc?

I believe two of you is fine.  We have stopped our rotation in the East and will have lots of work to do re: setting up books, continuing with terminations etc.  Until it becomes evident, continue on.

Heather and I will both be out Monday as part of the schedule rotation. Fran and Sam will be here. We will be alternating days off unless something comes up.
