Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

Thank you
