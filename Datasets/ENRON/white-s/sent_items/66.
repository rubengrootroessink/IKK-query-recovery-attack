Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss, who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.
