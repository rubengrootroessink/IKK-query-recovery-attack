The option query that we ran this morning does not tie back to AdHoc.  I first realized it when I was trying to clean up deals that had many strips.  There were instances where the P&L and delta were not consistent for every strip so I looked in AdHoc to see which number was right and that is when I started noticing inconsistencies.  Could you please query the P&L and Delta for the following deal numbers in spreadsheet.  The only way I have to do this is to query each deal separately in AdHoc.  Your help would be greatly appreciated.
