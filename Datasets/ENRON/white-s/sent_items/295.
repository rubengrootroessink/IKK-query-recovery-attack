Elsie, 

I put the 11/30 strip back in the deal.  The "884449 in bankruptcy" does refer to another deal that we created due to Aquila terminating transactions with us.  The reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio.

Stacey,
	On deal 321581.1, there were adjustments made 12/10-12/11.   Appears to have deleted 11/30/01 strip.  In deal comments, what does "884449 in bankruptcy" mean?  I tried looking up this deal, but it did not exist.  

Thanks,
Elsie
