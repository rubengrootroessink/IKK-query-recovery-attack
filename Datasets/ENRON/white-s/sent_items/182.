Now that Will has been cleaning out scheduling tables, will you ensure that the prepays in the document below are still in the scheduling system.  If they are not, we can autoschedule them.  

Thanks,
Stacey

In answer to your question, it is a prepay. I am sure there are more deals than what is showing on this list.

John, this details the agreed upon prepaid transactions to satisfy STSW in the money positions.  If you have any questions please contact myself or Tom Alonso.
