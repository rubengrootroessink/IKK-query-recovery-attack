We will be having a staff meeting today.  If we can start at 12:15 rather than 12:00 that would be great because I have an 11:00 meeting.

John,
What is the phone number where we can reach you?

Sorry I do not have an itinerary.  I would like to go over Doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while.

Stacey
