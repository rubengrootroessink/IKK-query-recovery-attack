Jeremy,

We will need no additional curves.  Only those designated by the gas group will need to be moved.  Thanks for the heads-up.

Stacey

Stacey:

The Gas Risk group is requesting that we preserve only a specified list of curves/pub codes for 
NetCo/UBS, and to delete the rest of the curves from TAGG/ERMS.

Please provide a list of Natural Gas curves/pub. codes that you would like to preserve in NetCo/UBS.

I am attaching the list of Natural Gas curves to preserve that Kam provided, for your reference:

 << File: Netco Curves.xls >> 

Thanks,
Jeremy
