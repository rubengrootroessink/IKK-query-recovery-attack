We are advised that we should wait for further instructions from Stacey White on this.  Will let you know as soon as we know the codes.

Thanks,

Haven't heard back from you on the book codes.  Let me know if you get the book codes assigned and I'll create the books here.

Jon,

I have completed the request for book setups and attached the completed sheet with ID's.  I have a few contacts to complete within the next 10 minutes.

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

J.P.
