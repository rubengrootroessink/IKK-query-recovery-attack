Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.
