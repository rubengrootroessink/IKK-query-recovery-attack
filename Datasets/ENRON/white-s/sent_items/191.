1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

Stephanie and Susan -- This remains a priority.  Please e-mail those persons identified above when a termination letter comes in from any of the below-listed East Power counterparties, and give a copy of the letter received to one of the listed power trading attorneys for immediate review.  Following a meeting this afternoon we will have a moire fully defined procedure and distribution list of names for communicating regarding the listed counterparties.  I will visit with you this morning so that we work out any questions you may have about this.  Thanks. --David

Stephanie -- Please keep watch for termination letters coming in from any of these counterparties and make me aware immediately of anything received --also Elizabeth Sager, Marcus, Harlan and Leslie.  We may be resuming the scheduling of power with these counterparties but will not do so with a party that has terminated its enabling agreement(s) with EPMI.  Thanks.
