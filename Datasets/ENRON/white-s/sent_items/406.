That is fine.  She doesn't really care about the Schedule C stuff, she just wants to know that is going to come off of LTD.

Agreed. I told Chris that we aren't doing anything until Tim talks to John. So do I just let Tracy know that we are taking the money and that we are taking it to Sch C?

As long as Tim has conversations with Lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting, we should be fine.

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a "?" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is "wait 60 days on PX"..."annuity 4 sale back to them".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

Can both of you give me some background on the 4 annuity deals listed below. Mark, these deals have never shown up on a desk analysis report and were entered on Mar 30 for jan business. Are they supposed to? Murray, are we supposed to be taking these annuities as PMA adjustments or are we still waiting for something more information?
 
 
Thanks for your help on this.
 
John

Stacey
 
Do you remember what was going to happen to these deals with the cap of 150.00? Will they be clearing anytime soon? 
 
Thanks
Tracy
