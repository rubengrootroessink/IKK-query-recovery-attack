Stacey, I believe the below email comes from AA.  I would like to run through you my planned answers to them.  Please review and let me know if it's appropriate.  (John is in Houston for training and I am not sure if he will check email today)

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book) agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deals in our LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.  (Stacey, I am thinking maybe accounting will hold the answer for this question?)

Thanks, 

Fran

Subject: 3rd Quarter Earnings Release Questions 


Fran, 

In reviewing the Management Summary, we had the following questions: 

1.  We noted that $14.8 million P&L related to Middle Market Originations 
(Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals? 
2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading (Belden)- 
legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to? 

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings release 
is quickly approaching, we would appreciate your prompt assistance. 

Thank you, 
Jennifer
