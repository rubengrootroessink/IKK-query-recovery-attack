Steven Luong and Nick are working on a better list with more specific names.  I'll keep you informed.

I could not find anything for Georgia Pacific or somebody called WAMP. There was also an SPPC which I really think is SPP(in Enpower) which is Sierra Pacific Power Company.

What is the exact name for Georgia Pacific?  We do not see any transactions with them in the system.
