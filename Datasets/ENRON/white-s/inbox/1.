Did you know?
     The prefix "prot-," or "proto-," comes from Greek and has
the basic meaning "first in time" or "first formed." A
"prototype" is someone or something that serves as a model or
inspiration for those that come later. A successful fund-raising
campaign can serve as a prototype for future campaigns. The
legendary Robin Hood, the "prototypical" kindhearted and honorable
outlaw, has been the inspiration for countless other romantic
heroes. And for over a century, Vincent van Gogh has been the
prototype of the brilliant, tortured artist who is unappreciated
in his own time.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
