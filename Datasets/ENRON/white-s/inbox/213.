The Word of the Day for December 17 is:

conglobate   \kahn-GLOH-bayt or kun-GLOH-bayt\   (verb)
     : to form into a round compact mass

Example sentence:
     Jack alternately conglobated and flattened the bit of clay
as he talked.

Did you know?
     Sharp-eyed readers may have noticed the "globe" in
"conglobate." The "globe" connection goes all the way back to
Latin -- "conglobate" descends from the Latin verb "conglobare,"
which in turn comes from the prefix "con-" (meaning "with,
together") and "globus" (meaning "globe"). "Conglobare" also
means "to form into a ball," and in the 16th century it gave us
the word "conglobe," of the same meaning. A century after
"conglobe" first appeared in print, its cousin "conglobate"
arrived on the scene. You may be wondering if the word "glob" is
a relative too. "Glob" isn't linked directly to "conglobate," but
it does have a possible link to "globe." Etymologists think that
"glob" might have originated as a blend of "globe" and "blob."
