The Word of the Day for October 30 is:

virtuoso   \ver-choo-OH-so or ver-choo-OH-zoh\   (noun)
     1 : one skilled in or having a taste for the fine arts
     2 : one who excels in the technique of an art; especially
: a highly skilled musical performer (as on the violin)
    *3 : a person who has great skill at some endeavor

Example sentence:
     Agatha Christie fans love her Belgian sleuth, Hercule
Poirot, a virtuoso whose "little gray cells" never fail to
unravel the most difficult murder cases.

Did you know?
     English speakers borrowed the Italian noun "virtuoso" in
the 1600s. It comes in turn from the Italian adjective
"virtuoso," which means both "virtuous" and "skilled." In
English, "virtuoso" can be pluralized as either "virtuosos" or
"virtuosi," and it is often used attributively ("a virtuoso
performer"). The first virtuosos were men of substantial
knowledge and learning ("great wits," to quote one 17th
century clergyman). The word was then transferred to those
skilled in the arts, and by the 18th century it had acquired
its specific sense applied to musicians. In the 20th century,
English speakers broadened "virtuoso" again to apply to a
person skilled in any pursuit.
