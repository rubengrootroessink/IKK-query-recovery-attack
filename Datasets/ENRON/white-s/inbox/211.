Andrea:

Thanks for doing that for us.  I also did a check by looking at ad hoc exported after the bankruptcy calc is done.  I believe there might be some deals that were missing in the process of changing the deals and moving them from west portfolio to bankruptcy portfolio.  I will be out starting from 12/17 on vacation.  I will ask John to confirm if there are more changes needed for the cleanup.

Thanks again,
Fran

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

Debbie-

I have attached two Excel files representing the P&L by counterparty for all deals in the East and West Bankruptcy portfolios.  Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

Thanks!
