Hi Stacey,

Thanks for taking a few minutes to speak with me regarding Warrick.  This is
a little information on our group.  Please feel free to call me if there is
anything I can help you with in the future.  Also, please do not hesitate to
forward my name and contact information to others in the industry that may
be able to benefit from speaking with a recruiter.  Our clients are located
here in Houston as well as across the country.  I specialize in commercial
and commercial support roles.  I am currently working on a senior level
power risk analyst role here in Houston.  If you happen to know anyone that
would be interested, please pass along my information.

I wish you the best with UBS.  Have a great weekend.

Thanks,

Tricia Womack
