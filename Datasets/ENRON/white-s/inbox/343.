I went to Dr. Goffman and would definitely recommend him.  As you remember, my eyes took longer to settle than most people, but after a few weeks my vision was 20/20.  Clark and Killian also used him and their eyes were perfect right away.  He's a nice guy and is great about follow-up.  I paid $2500 total, but his costs sometimes fluctuate depending on the cost of the laser center they use.  I'd call him now to schedule a consultation before you create a spending account.  There's always a chance your cornea isn't thick enough for the surgery.  The offices are located off the Katy freeway close to Voss.  Mention me as a reference!  He gives out eyeglass vouchers.  I can always use more shades here in sunny London.  Looking forward to seeing you this weekend.  Jenny.

*We decided to name the new puppy Spike.  I can't wait to see him over Christmas!  On Sunday I saw a woman walking five tiny yorkies and carrying another.  It looked like a parody of the Budweiser Clydesdales.  Very cute.

Who was your surgeon for lasik surgery?  Would you recommend?  I am planning on getting surgery next year and have to make my benefit elections to cover.

Thanks,
Stacey
