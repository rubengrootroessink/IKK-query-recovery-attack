Will,

I am attaching a list of the deals (both physical and financial) which simply need a desk name change to East or West Bankrupt, whichever is relevant.  My list details the deal #, counterparty full name and the termination date.  Let me know if this makes sense, and as always, thank you so much for your help!

Casey
