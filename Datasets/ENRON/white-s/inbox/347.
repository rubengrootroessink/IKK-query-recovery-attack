The Word of the Day for October 28 is:

veritable   \VAIR-uh-tuh-bul\   (adjective)
     : being in fact the thing named and not false, unreal, or
imaginary

Example sentence:
     Todd is a veritable wellspring of information on local
history and folklore.

Did you know?
     "Veritable," like its close relative "verity" ("truth"),
came to English through Middle French from Latin. It is
ultimately derived from "verus," the Latin word for "true,"
which also gave us "verify," "aver," and "verdict." "Veritable"
is often used as a synonym of "genuine" or "authentic" ("a
veritable masterpiece"), but it is also used to stress the
aptness of a metaphor, often in a humorous tone ("a veritable
swarm of lawyers"). In the past, usage commentators have objected
to the latter use, but today it doesn't draw much criticism.
