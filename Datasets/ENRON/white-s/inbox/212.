The Word of the Day for December 15 is:

gibe   \JYBE\   (verb)
    *1 : to utter taunting words
     2 : to deride or tease with taunting words

Example sentence:
     When the crowd began to hoot and gibe at him, Chris decided
to cut his speech short.

Did you know?
     Confused about "jibe" and "gibe"? The distinction actually
isn't as clear-cut as some commentators would like it to be.
"Jibe" is used both for the verb meaning "to be in accord, agree"
("jibe with") and for the verb and noun of nautical parlance
("jibe the mainsail," "a risky jibe in heavy seas"). "Gibe" is
used for the verb "to deride or tease" and the noun "a taunting
remark." But "jibe" is a recognized variant of "gibe," so it,
too, has taunting or teasing uses. "Gibe" has been used
occasionally as a variant of "jibe," but this use is very rare,
and many would consider it to be an error.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
