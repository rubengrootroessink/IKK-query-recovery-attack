Weather Alert (WRA Services Corp) is a sub of Enron North America Corp.  For Weather Alert to get money they would have to receive a deposit from company 446, the non dip cash services company.(ENE Adminstrative Services Corp)  The transfer would have to be approved by the cash committee and forecasted.  I left a message for Angie Wingo (last week) to find out what is going on with Weather Alert.  She must be on vacation.  Let me know if you want to try to get the money transferred.  To my knowledge company 446 has money from the Sithe deposits a couple of weeks ago.

Let's talk about Weather Alert on Weds.  It seems that checks sent out pre-petition are being presented to be bank and there are no funds in the account.  Who is the parent of Weather Alert?  Do we know of any reason that we need to honor these checks?
