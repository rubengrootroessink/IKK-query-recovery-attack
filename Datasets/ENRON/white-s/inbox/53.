     Sally/Jeff/Stacey:

     Not sure if you've already seen this-did not see you on the e-mail
     dist list so apologies if duplicative.

     Attached is the document from Gabriel/Wes outlining the split of
     responsibilities per the meeting we had.

     I've taken a quick look and seems OK. He did list cash reconciliations
     as Operations which is correct for the UBSW model, but I don't think
     we've discussed yet who does this or resourcing....I think its done by
     someone in Greg Whiting's group. Vito Sabatelli had sent an e-mail to
     Per on the topic but no update....not sure if you want to take up with
     Wes as well?

     If you have any issues, plse go back to Wes or Gabriel.

     thanks
     Liliana

     All,

     Please review the attached and come back to Wes or myself ASAP in case
