Files were to big to attach so my mail came back undeliverable.

There are two files in O:\_Dropbox\gramesh divided alphabetically by counterparty.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject:	Positions at 11.30.01

The attached files contain positions and values by counterparty by curve as reported to RAC for cob 11.30.01. 
This file was run yesterday so should contain any adjustments made to closing positions on that date.

Please review for accuracy of reporting and respond if you see material differences in your internal reporting.
