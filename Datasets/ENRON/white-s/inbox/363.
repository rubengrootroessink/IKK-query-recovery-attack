So far I have talked to everyone but Heather. As I mentioned Nick was much =
better than I anticipated. He said things were a little slower than he was =
expecting but nothing else. The point I wanted to get across to him was to =
take the initiative in working with Jeff and getting more involved within o=
ur group.

Fran was a little unusual. She was concerned about having to wait each morn=
ing before running liquidations because we are not flat and she felt that i=
t was a bad reflection on the group if we reported late. She was also conce=
rned about the Enpower QandA meeting and why none of the West issues had be=
en taken care of that have been sitting there for a couple of months. She a=
lso couldn't understand why it mentioning your name before they would take =
the index option out of the PCS. She just wished that if Bill Crooks requir=
ed your approval then he should say so. Finally, while she has seen some im=
provement with Heather, she is still a little unhappy with her. She feels t=
hat Heather is not doing her part in helping with the day to day routines e=
nough, disappears for a while,etc. I told her that I would talk to Bill abo=
ut the status of our projects, that we need to run liquidations by 9 each m=
orning no matter what and I will address the issue with Bill Williams and T=
im only if necessary. Heather's issues I was going to address anyway, so we=
 will see how that goes. I did tell Fran that she has really stepped up and=
 become a "lead" in this group and that she is doing an outstanding job. I =
also mentioned to her that I talked to you about the work status thing and =
she was very grateful for that. I asked what her long term goals were and s=
he thought at some point about getting into structuring and maybe doing tha=
t in Houston! I was surprised by that comment.


Sam's went fairly well. Her only concern was regarding team spirit. Not wha=
t I thought it meant thought. She really means interaction between people, =
so I have suggested that we go more regular meeting depending on what proje=
cts are going on within the group. She also is comparing herself to Fran an=
d the learning curve. She wanted to know how she could learn more like what=
 Fran has done. The only thing that I see as different between the two is t=
hat Fran has been heavily involved with the index and Asian options. I reco=
mmended that Sam take on some of these "testing duties" and she was happy a=
bout that.
