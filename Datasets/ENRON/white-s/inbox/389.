Everything imbalance related is located at M\EServices\Ercot\Risk\Ercot Imbalance.  Let me know what I can do to help!

Can you send me (or tell me what directory) the spreadsheet provided to you by Michael for ERCOT Imbalances.  I have a meeting Friday to go over how the volume management group and risk groups interface and what data is shared between the two.  So anything you can tell me would be helpful.
