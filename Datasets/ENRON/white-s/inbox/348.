The Word of the Day for October 27 is:

nyctalopia   \nik-tuh-LOH-pee-uh\   (noun)
     : night blindness

Example sentence:
     George's nyctalopia gives him a tendency to walk into
furniture unless he turns on all the lights.

Did you know?
     "Nyctalopia" comes to us from the Latin word "nyctalops,"
which means "suffering from night blindness." It is ultimately
derived from the Greek word "nyktalops," which was formed by
combining the word for "night" ("nyx") with the words for
"blind" and "eye" ("alaos" and "ops," respectively). English
speakers have been using "nyctalopia" to refer to reduced
vision in faint light or at night since the 17th century. We
added the somewhat more pedestrian "night blindness" to the
lexicon in the 18th century.
