Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

Thanks
