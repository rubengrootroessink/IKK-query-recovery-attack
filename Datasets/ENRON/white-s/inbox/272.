So I am sure you heard about last Friday and that they told everyone who was
with NEWCO and who wasn't. I talked to Bob and I was surprised that Sam is
part of the new company. Wanted to confirm that with you. I have not talked
to her yet since she was on vacation but was planning to do so today. Let me
know if anything has changed on this front.

How was Xmas?

John
