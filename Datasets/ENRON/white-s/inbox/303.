The Word of the Day for December 31 is:

syllabub   \SIH-luh-bub\    (noun)
     1 : a drink made by curdling milk or cream with an acid
beverage (as wine or cider)
     *2 : a sweetened drink or topping made of milk or cream
beaten with wine or liquor and sometimes further thickened with
gelatin and served as a dessert

Example sentence:
      "There will be Champagne and wine for the adults as well
as eggnog [and] syllabub, a frothy cream and wine concoction."
(Marian Burros, _Chicago Tribune_, December 23, 1993)

Did you know?
     Syllabub's a concoction whose name once had almost as many
variations as there are versions of how to make it -- "solybubbe,"
"sullabub," "sullibib," "sellibub," "sallibube," "sillie bube,"
"sillybob," even "sillibuck" and "sillybauk." Unfortunately, no
one's figured out where the name came from (there's no connection
to "silly," as far as we know, though imbibing it might make one
act that way). Both the name "syllabub" and the concoction itself
go back to at least the 16th century. Today, we're more likely to
encounter "syllabub" in a historical novel than on the menu at a
local drinking spot, but the drink/dessert does get made
occasionally -- and those fortunate enough to taste it often give
it rave reviews.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
