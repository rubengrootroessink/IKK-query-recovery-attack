Folks-

Kori asked us to kill all the deals between her portfolio and other portfolio due to the bankruptcy.  For this reason, I used Casey's ID (because I did not have access) to access about 20 deals, and I killed these deals.  I have created a spreadsheet with each of these deals listed.

Thanks.

Tom
