Dear Casey, Donnie,

	We have made some final changes to the Financial curves UNIX file generation, and finished the testings for today.  

	The curves for region Into AEP ( R2A), basis point Ameren (B10), Michigan ( B12) and Illinois ( B37) have some differences between the Excel files and the New Curve Manager due to data-entry. Apart from that, the tests went well with no other problems.

	We are ready for Production on Monday, and Arun, Siva and Anand will help the traders like the last rollout. 

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.
