I have been asked by legal to pull together the MTM value going forward plus the A/R and A/P balances.

Also, anything els that may relate to the counterparties we are still serving.

I know that Dec A/R and A/P are not correct at the moment.  Any estimate of cleaning up.

Let's talk today.

thanks

bob
