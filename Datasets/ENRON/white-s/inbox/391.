Stacey,

Not sure if you want to call Lloyd or not, but in addition to Bloomberg, Amerex and Truequote, you can get viewing rights to EOL through e-request.  I'll keep looking and let you know if I get any others.

Bloomberg.com gives hourly quotes for the hourly market for 3 curves.  If you need more information, I suggest you talk to Lloyd Will.  He is the Director of the power fundamentals group.

Lucretia,

I work in global risk and am looking for a listing of online quote sites for power. I was hoping you may have some sites (Xotchil thought you may).  Could you forward me the addresses of sites you use.

Thanks

Keith
