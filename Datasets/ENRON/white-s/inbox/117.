I see you two ( or your delegates) being the approvers of users for RisktRAC, outside of Credit and Market risk requirements.  Please take a look at what Ramesh put together...I foresee a few changes but would like your input as well.
 
We also need to talk about plans for book/portfolio set ups. Do you have time tomorrow morning to get together?

Debbie,
This is a list of users I think we should start out with in the NETCO databases and our applications. This list of users connect directly to the Oracle database and have access to RisktRAC(VB). Web users need not have an account on the Oracle databases. I have not considered that list at this point in time.
 
Please take a look at this list and let me know whether anyone else should be added/deleted.
 
Andrew,
I will be in tomorrow very early. I will leave between 10:45 and 11:00AM. I have to attend a Jeff Johnson meeting.
 
Regards,
Ramesh
