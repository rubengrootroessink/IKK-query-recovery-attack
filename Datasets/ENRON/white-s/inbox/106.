Casey,

Currently we have the following books set up in ERMTP, and only PWR-GAS-SE has been set up from your list and the others are not found.  Also we do not inactivate books on our side.  But I think they can be inactivated on Risktrac side.

166969	PWR-GAS-CALI
166965	PWR-GAS-ERCOT
166973	PWR-GAS-MGMT
166963	PWR-GAS-MW
166962	PWR-GAS-NE
166967	PWR-GAS-NW
166961	PWR-GAS-OPTION
166964	PWR-GAS-SE
166968	PWR-GAS-SW
166966	PWR-GAS-WMGMT


John,
Please advise if the books are already set up in Global and I'll set them up in Erms.

Thanks,
Cecilia

As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!  

Thanks!
