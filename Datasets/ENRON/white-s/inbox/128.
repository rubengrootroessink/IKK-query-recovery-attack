CHILI COOK-OFFS
> >  NOTE: Please take  time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how True this is!  They actually have a chili cook-off about the time the  rodeo comes to town. It takes up a major portion  of the parking lot at the Astrodome! You will
likely want to read this behind closed doors because, if you are like me,  you'll laugh out loud.
