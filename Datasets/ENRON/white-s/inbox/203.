All,

I have modified Deal Liquidation as follows (new version in stage).

1.)  You can now query based on counterparty and phys/fin in addition to specifying a deal number
2.)  You no longer need to provide the leg of the deal.  Specifying the peer will grab all of the legs.
3.)  The new splitting process will work as follows.
If the entire deal is prior to the termination date (inclusive), then nothing is done to the deal.
If the entire deal is after the termination date (exclusive), then the desk is simply changed to East Bank or West Bank.
If the deal crosses the termination date boundary, the deal is copied as follows:
For the original deal:
All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not changed.
All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are killed.
All legs crossing over the termination date are truncated.  This includes deleting strips starting after the date and truncating strips that cross over the date.

For the new deal:  This deal will be in one of the Bankruptcy books
All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not copied.
All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are copied as is - no strips are changed.
Any legs crossing over the termination date are copied and modified to reside solely after the date.  This includes deleting strips that end prior to the date and modifying strips that cross over the date.

These changes should allow you to perform all of the tasks necessary to close out deals with any counterparty.

Please test and let me know if there are any problems.

Regards,
Will
