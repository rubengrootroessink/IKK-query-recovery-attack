Sorry I haven't called, it's been crazy. I am actually sitting on a plane
about to leave for Cancun on our mgmt trip.

I need to call and catch up with you$... See how the baby's doing, check on
your status with Enron, etc.

If I ca find a stamp in Cancun, I'll mail yor b-day card

Take care-
Chris
