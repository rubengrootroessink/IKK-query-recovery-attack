       You know you're from Texas if:
1.  You measure distance in hours.
2.  You've ever had to switch from "heat to "a/c" in the same day.
3.  Stores don't have bags; they have sacks.
4.  Stores don't have shopping carts: they have buggies.
5.  You see a car running in the parking lot at the store with no one in it, no matter   what time of the year.
6.  You use "fix" as a verb. Example: "It's fixin to rain".
7.  All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, grain or animal.
8. You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked.
9. You carry jumper cables in your car - for your OWN car.
10. You know what "cow tipping" and "snipe hunting" are.
11. You only own four spices: salt, pepper, ketchup and Tabasco.
12. You think everyone from a bigger city has an accent.
13. You think sexy lingerie is a tee shirt and boxer shorts. -- OH YEAH!!   :-)
14. The local paper covers national and international news on one page but requires 6 pages for sports.
15. You think that the first day of deer season is a national holiday.
16. You know which leaves make good toilet paper.
17. You find 90 degrees F "a little warm".
18. You know all four seasons: Almost summer, Summer, Still summer, and Christmas.
19. You know whether another Texan is from southern, middle or northern Texas as soon as they open their mouth.
20. There is a Dairy Queen in every town with a population of 1000 or more.
21. Going to Wal Mart is a favorite past time known a "goin' Wal Martin" or off to "Wally World".
22. You describe the first cool snap (below 70) as "good chili weather".
23. A Carbonated soft drink isn't a soda, cola or pop - it's a Coke, regardless of brand or flavor.
24. You understand these jokes and forward them to your friends from Texas.
