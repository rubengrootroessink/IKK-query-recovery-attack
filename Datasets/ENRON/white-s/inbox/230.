The Word of the Day for December 20 is:

flippant   \FLIH-punt\   (adjective)
     : lacking proper respect or seriousness

Example sentence:
     When Candice asked her nephew where he'd been, he replied
with a flippant "Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies."

Did you know?
     "Flippant" did something of a flip-flop shortly after it
appeared in English in the 17th century. "Flippant" was probably
created from the verb "flip," which in turn likely originated as
an imitation of the sound of something flipping. The earliest
senses of the adjective were "nimble" and "limber." One could be
flippant not only on one's feet, but also in speech -- that is,
someone "flippant" might have a capacity for easy, flowing
speech. Such "flippancy" was considered a good thing at first.
But people who speak freely and easily can sometimes seem too
talkative, even impertinent. By the end of the 18th century, the
positive sense of "flippant" had slipped from use, and the
"disrespectful" sense had taken its place.
