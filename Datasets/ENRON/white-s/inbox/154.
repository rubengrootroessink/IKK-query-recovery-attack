I'm attaching 2 book request forms for Netco East Power.  One form is for 6 TAGG gas books and the other form is for approximately 25 Enpower power books.

Bill and Torrey - A list will be following immediately of old book names and associated new Netco book names for each power trader.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Casey
