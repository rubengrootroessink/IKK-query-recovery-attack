Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you
have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than
likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we
are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as
setting up details of the new business.

Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with
you?

Stacey

If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.
713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this
e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang.
