I sent this to John Valdes.  He will check the book codes and get back with Cecilia to have her set them up today.

We are advised that we should wait for further instructions from Stacey White on this.  Will let you know as soon as we know the codes.

Thanks,

Haven't heard back from you on the book codes.  Let me know if you get the book codes assigned and I'll create the books here.

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

J.P.
