Mexican is good w/me.  I know Lamar will like that too.  We are going to le=
ave as soon as he gets off work, which should be 4:00, so 6 or 7 is probabl=
y right.  We decided that after this weekend, we are going to get strict ba=
ck on our diet.  We have both done so well...I have lost 17 pounds and Lama=
r has lost about twenty (I think).  That thirty days was hard, but worth it=
.  Now we are eating on the diet at home, but eating what we want when we g=
o out.  In fact, I have not had Mexican food since before September!  We to=
ok Sandy out to Johnny Carino's for her birthday last night.  We had kept S=
hotzie (sp?)  since last Thursday, and I think Sandy missed her more than s=
he missed Sandy!  I think she was just glad to have Winston as a playmate. =
 I finished To Tame a Texan's Heart last night.  It was pretty good.  I can=
't wait for the semester to be over so I can get in some reading during the=
 holidays.  I had promised myself I would read all of the books on Oprah's =
book club list.  So far I have read only one!  Well, enough rambling...see =
you guys tomorrow.
