Make sure all price and volatility curves have been final posted in Curve Manager.

Contact Min Zheng (or whomever will be handling this for the estate) to run the script which writes the curves into the m:\power2\region Excel files (these are used by Structuring, EES and East Price if we were to run it again)

Calculate "East Bankruptcy Calc xx/xx/xx vs yy/yy/yy" 
-  Run it on 'Official Adhoc Full Book' and do not officialize upon completion
-  Use '/prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new' as your executable
-  email Debbie Brackett, Stephanie McGinnis and John Powell daily with the post-id for the calc

Calculate "Official East Non-Terminated Transactions xx/xx/xx vs yy/yy/yy" 
-  Run it on 'Official Adhoc Full Book' and officialize upon completion
-  Use 'default' as your executable

To run the rolls for Terminated and Non-Terminated books:
-  run DPR Automation (m:\common\power\estate\2002\0102\NEW) on both the East and EastBank portfolios separately
-  for the EAST-PERF book you'll need to also run DPR Automation on PCS/PID in the morning to pull in the liquidations.
-  link EAST-PERF, EAST-NPERF and EPMI-EAST-BANK into the Consolidated Report file
-  each day, copy the 'NEW' folder into the 'DATE SPECIFIC' folder and run the 'PRIOR-ESTATE' file located in the 'NEW'
	folder to run each roll's daily change macro
