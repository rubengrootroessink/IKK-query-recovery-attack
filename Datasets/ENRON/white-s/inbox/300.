The Word of the Day for December 30 is:

balneology   \bal-nee-AH-luh-jee\   (noun)
     : the science of the therapeutic use of baths

Example sentence:
     Dori studied balneology in Europe and now applies her
knowledge at a spa in the U.S.

Did you know?
     "Sure, the hot water feels good. Sure, the massage is nice.
But it goes beyond that, advocates say." So wrote Ellen Creager
in an article published on February 18, 2001 in the _Detroit
Free Press_. The healing powers of mineral baths have long been
touted by advocates like those mentioned by Creager. Though
we've had the word "balneology" for just over 120 years, this
method of treating aching muscles, joint pain, and skin ailments
goes back to ancient times. Proponents of the science of bath
therapy created the name "balneology" from Latin "balneum"
("bath") and "-logy" ("science"). Today, some medical institutes
in Europe have departments of balneology. Modern "balneologists"
impart their knowledge to, or themselves serve as,
"balneotherapists," who apply their "balneotherapy" to grateful
clients.
