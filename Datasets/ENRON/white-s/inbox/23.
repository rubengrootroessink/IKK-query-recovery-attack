meone out on Friday, please make sure they pack before they leave or you ha=
ve someone pack their stuff for them.  Please make sure that everyone clean=
s out their desk completely.  I know that boxes are hard to find right now.=
  If any of you know that you will need quite a few boxes for your groups, =
please let me know ASAP so I can have them delivered by Thursday .  I know =
