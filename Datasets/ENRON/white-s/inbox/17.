Hey You Guys,
 
Below are the calendars for February and  March.
 
Other News Letter Items:
 
Spring  Festival
This has been moved back to the Mom's Group to  organize and do it.  Any volunteers will be greatly appreciated, contact  Karen Roush.  Please respond quickly, as the date of the Spring Festival is  March 30th!!
 
Garage Sale
The garage sale date has yet to be determined, but  will hopefully be decided on this week.  If anyone knows the  date of the Winchester Trails' Garage Sale this year, please let me  know, that's when we want to schedule ours.
 
 
Cookbook Sale
We still have quite a few cookbooks to sell.   If each Mom would take 3-5 cookbooks and ask neighbors/friends/etc we could sell  them quickly.  Please help out - call or email Rania Combs 281-807-3944 or  raniacombs@houston.rr.com   
 
If I have dates/times/etc incorrect below, please  let me know.  I plan on sending this in to the newsletter next  week.
 
Thanks!
Michelle
