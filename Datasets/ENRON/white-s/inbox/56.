Stacey,  We need to make sure at a minimum we get the sheet that Fletch brought into the meeting as an example.  I'm sure he will know which one it is...

Thanks,  Steve

Since we talked about a lot of different spreadsheets, can you give me some more guidance on what was included in the spreadsheet I talked about so I will send you the correct one.

Stacey,

Would you please send us trader's position sheet that you mention in our meeting few days ago
Currently, we work on building a prototype for traders.
