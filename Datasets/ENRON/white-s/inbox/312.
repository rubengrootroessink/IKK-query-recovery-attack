The Word of the Day for January 1 is:

neoteric   \nee-uh-TARE-ik\   (adjective)
     : recent in origin : modern

Example sentence:
     "I find neoteric fiction dreadful as a rule, so I
concentrate my reading on the works of the masters of
yesteryear," declared Anthony.

Did you know?
     An odd thing about "neoteric" is that this word for things
that are modern and new is itself very old. It's been part of
English since at least 1596, and its roots go back even further
-- to ancient Greek. We adapted the word from Late Latin
"neotericus," which also means "recent"; "neotericus" comes from
Greek "neoterikos" and ultimately from "neos," meaning "new" or
"young." As old as its roots are, however, "neoteric" itself
entered English later than its synonyms "modern" (which appeared
earlier in the 16th century) and "newfangled" (which has been
with us since the 14th century).
