syncretic   \sin-KREH-tik or sing-KREH-tik\   (adjective)

Did you know?
     "Syncretic" has its roots in an ancient alliance. It's a
descendant of the Greek word "synkretismos," meaning
"federation of Cretan cities" -- "syn-" means "together, with,"
and "Kret-" means "Cretan." The English word "syncretic"
retains the idea of coalition, and appears in such contexts as
"syncretic religions," "syncretic societies," and even
"syncretic music." "Syncretic" also has a specific application
in linguistics, where it refers to a fusion of grammatical forms.
