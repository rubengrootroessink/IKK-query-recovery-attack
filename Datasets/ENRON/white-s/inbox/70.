In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was  busily working when a new voice came over the intercom asking for a carry out at  check register 4. Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air,  and decided to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a  distantsmile caught his eye, the new  check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only  22) and he immediately fell in love.
 
Later that day, after his shift was over, he  waited by the punch out clock to find out her name. She came into the break room  and smiled softly at him and took her card and punched out and left. He looked  at her card - BRENDA. He walked out only to see her start walking up the  road.
 
The next day, he waited outside as she left  the supermarket, and offered her a ride home. He looked harmless enough, and she  accepted. When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again,  outside of work. She simply said it wasn't possible. He pressed and then she  explained she had two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter. So he  offered to pay for the baby-sitter. She reluctantly accepted his offer for a  date for the following Saturday.
 
That Saturday night he arrived at her door  only to have her tell him that she was unable to go out with him. The  baby-sitter had called and canceled. To which Kurtis simply said, "Well,  lets take the kids with us."
 
She tried to explain that taking the children  was not an option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed. Finally  Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who  was very cute, Kurtis thought. Then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.  He was born a paraplegic with Down's syndrome. Kurtis asked Brenda, "I  still don't understand why the kids can't come with us?"
 
Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away  from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her  first husband and father of the children did.
 
That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the  kids, went to dinner and the movies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would  take care of him. When he needed to use the restroom, he picked him up out of  his wheel-chair and took him. The kids loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening,  Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her  life with.
 
A year later, they were married and Kurtis  adopted both of her children and since then have added two more children to the  family.
 
So what happened to the stock boy and the  check out girl? Well, Mr. And Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he  is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays  quarterback.
