John,

Currently, there is no way we can meet this need.  The information we get from EOL does not include a desk id and we must determine the id based on the criteria given below.  

There are two possible solutions
1)  Add one or more other fields as criteria for determining the desk.
2)  Have EOL send the desk id in the bridge message.

Although I cannot speak for EOL IT, I suspect that solution 2 would be very involved.  I doubt that traders are even able to select a desk when creating a product in EOL.  Melba, can you verify this fact?

If option 1 is doable from a business perspective, we will need to discuss further the changes and timeline involved for IT.  This issues should be raise in the meeting with Steve Nat tomorrow.

Regards,
Will

Will, due to the changing circumstances, the West and Canada have traders using multiple books, multiple regions for phys and Fin. Can we work around this or make a change that would not be too complicated?

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Will

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of "NETCO Long Term Southwest" after I have added him as the trader for "NETCO Long Term California",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise. 

Thanks,

Fran
