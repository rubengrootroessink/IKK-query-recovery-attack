For those of you I have not told, my brother Eric was recently laid off
from Siemens out of Atlanta.  He is looking for a sales position,
especially in the field of medical devices.  He is leaving open the option
of  moving back to Texas if he is able to find employment here.  I am
including a brief paragraph he wrote about his experience.

I would love to have my brother, sister 'n law, little niece, and unborn
child back in Texas.  If you know of any contacts in the medical device
field, please let me know and my brother will send them his resume.

Jason, my husband, is still looking for a job also!  He is looking for
pharmaceutical sales, but is also leaving his options open for other sales
opportunities in Dallas!

Thank you for your help during this difficult time!

Hope all is well with everyone!

Chris

From Eric:
I am an accomplished sales professional with 10 years experience developing
and implementing technology-based solutions.  I have direct sales
experience
with national accounts and have managed a sales force in the Southeastern
region of the U.S.

Over the years, I have had outstanding success building and maintaining
relationships with key corporate decision makers and I've established
large-volume, high-profit accounts with excellent levels of retention and
loyalty.

I've spent my entire career with Moore Products Co., which was recently
acquired by Siemens.  Due to the economic conditions and restructuring at
Siemens I am leaving the company and I'm seizing this opportunity to apply
my high-tech professional sales skills into the medical device industry.

Do you know anyone in this market that could provide me more information
about companies in this industry or any companies looking for people with
my
skills?
