The Word of the Day for October 29 is:

petulant   \PEH-chuh-lunt\   (adjective)
     1 : insolent or rude in speech or behavior
    *2 : characterized by temporary or capricious ill humor

Example sentence:
     "'What is it all about?' cried Dorian in his petulant way,
flinging himself down on the sofa." (Oscar Wilde, _The Picture
of Dorian Gray_)

Did you know?
     "Petulant" is one among many English words akin to or
derived from the Latin verb "petere," which means "to go to,"
"to attack," "to seek," or "to request." "Petere" is a relative
of the Latin adjective "petulans, petulantis" ("impudent"), from
which "petulant" was derived. Some other words that are related
to "petere" are "compete" and "appetite." "Competere," the Latin
precursor to "compete," is a joining of the prefix "com-" with
the verb "petere." The joining of "ad-" and "petere" led to
"appetere" ("to strive after"), and eventually to "appetitus,"
the source of our "appetite."  Additional descendants of "petere"
are "petition," "perpetual," and "impetus."
