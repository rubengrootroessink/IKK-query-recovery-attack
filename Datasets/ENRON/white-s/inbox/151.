Hi Mom's!  I hope everyone had a fun, relaxing  (yeah, right!) and safe holiday season!  Now it's back to reality, hee  hee!
 
Below are the notes from the January meeting we had  this past Tuesday.  Sorry they're getting out a bit late, trying to  check/confirm some items.  I may have missed some items, so let me know if  I did!
 
Anywho, a couple of notes from the  meeting:
 
Mom's With New  Babies
  -  Congratulations!!  We've had  several new additions this past month, and wanted to welcome all the wee little  ones to the group.
 
Mom's Night Out - Change Of  Venue
  -  Due to the circumstances surrounding  the bill for the Mom's Christmas party, it was decided to change the method of  payment for dinners.  We will now individually pay for our own  dinner/drinks, including tax and tip.  Appetizers will be handled the same  way - you "divvy" up the cost with those who ate it.  We will no  longer split the bill evenly among everyone.  We have had several instances  where people have ordered lesser valued meals or shared meals with someone, and  end up paying more then their share.  We hope this helps out the bill  situation, so we can all enjoy the entire evening!  We will have a  calculator handy (hopefully) so everyone can figure out tax and tip  accordingly.
 
Mom's Group Open  House
  -  We are going to host another Open  House inviting all Mom's and future Mom's to join our group.  This will be  scheduled for Tuesday, April 2nd.  I will reprint the newsletter  article.  I have shown Dianna Hadley as our wonderful hostess, so please  give her a call as we plan on having several people bring appetizers/drinks to  help.  It will be at the clubhouse, and we ask for Mom's to get there  around 6:30 or so to help "beautify" the place :)
 
Mom's Group Garage  Sale
  -  We are planning a spring garage sale  to coincide with the timing of the Winchester Trails bi-annual garage  sale.  I'm still trying to find out the date of their's (so if anyone  knows, let me know!) but we're hoping to have it sometime in March or  April.  Please stash your garage sale items in the meantime!  And if  you desperately need the space it's currently occuping, let me know and I will  try to find room for it.  We will also coordinate with a local charity to  pick up the remaining items after the sale.  We will ask that the charity  supply us with the necessary documentation for tax credit as well.  I will  be writing a brief article for the newsletter informing our subdivision of this  upcoming event.
 
Mom's Group Coobook  Sale
  -  We desperately need to sell the  remaining cookbooks.  We plan on having a booth at the Spring Festival and  the garage sale.  Also, ask your neighbors if they'd like one!  I've  tried a lot of the recipes and all I can say is YUM!
 
Mom's Group Food  Drive
  -  Thanks to Dianna and Laurel for  taking the time to store the food for the BMAC food drive we did for  Christmas.  I know Lacey Telge also took some food over, so thanks  Lacey!  And thanks to all the Mom's and neighbors who helped in making a  donation to the needy.  Dianna said the Bear Creek Ministry really  appreciated it.
