Melissa, Stacey,

Have you ever experienced the problem that Brad is describing below?  If so, how do we resolve it?  Is it a Global issue?

Thanks,
Will

Hi Will,
yes this is still a problem.  The affected deal numbers and appropriate contract numbers are as follows :

deal # 832456.3	contract # 96063178
deal # 832390.3	contract # 96063003
deal # 832413.3	contract # 96062843

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Brad

Brad,

My apologies for not responding sooner.  I have been on vacation for the last week and a half.  

Is this still a problem?  If so, can you give me a list of the affected deals and the contracts that should be assigned to them?

Thanks,
Will

Hi Will,
per my phone message, we are having difficulties now with 3 not 2 deals with respect to their contract numbers.  The recent deal is # 832413 for Vornweg Waterpower.  Again, contract number 96063077 appears under the deal clearing tab.  This is the incorrect contract number and I the correct one is not under the Global contract number dropdown box, which it usually is with our Ontario deals.  Can you please help me with this problem as soon as you have a minute.

Thanks,
Brad
