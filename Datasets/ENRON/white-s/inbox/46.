Please review and let me ASAP know if anyone should be removed from this list for dual access to UBS and Enron applications.   Christina will keep the master and will make adjustments as you let one of the two of us know.  Thanks.  --Sally

Jay,

Here are the dual-access IDs that were requested.  I told the IT Teams that they would be reviewed by legal and yourself.
