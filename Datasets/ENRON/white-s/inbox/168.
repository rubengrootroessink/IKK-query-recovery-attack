I know you may or may not remember me, but I went to school with you.  Never seemed to get your attention then, but I had the biggist freakin crush on you. That seems like a thousand years ago, now.  I hope you are well, and that life is great. I know everyone has grown up, but the memories are still there....the band trips, the football games, the gossip...oh, the gossip.
anyway, drop me a line and let me know where the road of life has taken you.
