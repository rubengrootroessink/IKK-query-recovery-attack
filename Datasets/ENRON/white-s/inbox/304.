President Bush, Visionary Leader
By Carol Devine-Molin

Since the aftermath of 9/11, President Bush has effectively dispelled
any lingering doubts regarding his ability to lead this great nation,
especially in light of his overall handling of the profound crisis
foisted upon us by the forces of terror. Clearly, Bush's actions on the
national security and war fronts have earned him significant backing
from the American people, as demonstrated by his approval ratings that
have remained in the high 80% bracket. He is well appreciated by the
American people, as is his wartime consiglieri, Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld.

But what sets Bush apart as an outstanding leader? Bush is a visionary,
a man with a remarkable plan that will significantly safeguard the
citizenry over the long haul. He is determined to strategically
orchestrate all that must be done in order to guarantee the safety and
security of the American people, not just for the immediate future, but
for several generations to come. Yes, President Bush and his resolute
team have set out to accomplish a monumental mission, which will
generate tremendous positive impact. Unlike Clinton, who was primarily
focused upon the short-term economy, his own public travails, and
excessive attempts to broker an all but impossible deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians, Bush understands that his primary
responsibility as president is to protect the American people, both at
home and abroad, plain and simple.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Two thousand and one has been a year that
Americans will always remember. We suffered great loss, and we found a
new unity. We were attacked, and we responded swiftly. We have seen the
strength of America in countless acts of kindness, compassion and
courage.

This year ends with progress on the battlefield and accomplishment at
home. The men and women of our military have successfully fought a new
kind of war. They applied new tactics and new technology to rout a new
kind of enemy. The lessons we learn in Afghanistan will guide our
military to the future, and make our country stronger and more secure.

On the home front, we're strengthening our defenses against terrorist
attack, while upholding our constitutional liberties. Our airways are
more secure, and we are standing on alert.

Teaching the Essentials
By Alan Keyes

According to the Washington Post, "The start of the war on terrorism
proved an unexpected tonic for education reform." The Post cites a White
House aide who said, "I think [congressional education negotiators] saw
it as a way they could demonstrate to the country that Congress had not
been immobilized." Apparently, the nation lives in fear that terrorists
will intimidate the people's representatives away from the now rapidly
resuming task of federal over-reaching executed in the name of reform.
Take heart, oh people! Our politicians will not be dissuaded from
expanding state power at the expense of liberty.

There are those, of course, who would rank a "mobilized Congress" high
on the list of terrorizing sights. Heaven help us when Ted Kennedy
partners with "compassionate conservatives" in issuing marching orders
for the education bureaucracy to "leave no child behind." War tends to
increase national governmental power -- not only in matters directly
related to the conflict, but also in vastly broader realms of our common
life. In a season of national pride and solidarity, advocates of
expanded government power tend to find rich fields offering "targets of
opportunity." Education is such a field, and in the legislation passed
last week, it has received a direct hit.

Beneath the News Lies the Real Problems
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Bombs on airplanes make sensational headlines.  The tanking economy
doesn't.  And that's exactly how we're going to enter the year 2002.
We'll be reading about isolated acts of terrorism that would probably
dwindle if so much media space weren't given to the whack jobs who try
to pull sensational, destructive acts for their own warped egos.

The plight of a million or so Americans who lost their jobs this past
year (and figures vary as to the exact number) isn't good news for
America or for the world.  It's the news in small print under the
stories about terrorism and the elusive bin Laden, who probably will
never be found.

Another New Year, Getting Better All The Time!
By SARTRE

The infinite capacity for delusion is the primary result of 'so called'
progress. During this holiday season we are constantly reminded about
good will to men and how nice the world is. We are told that the next
year will be better and that the promise for mankind is bright. Focus is
always directed towards the advancement of society. What sells in this
world of myth and mirage, is a fairy tale for the faint of heart, for
the ending must always lead to happy every after . . .

Ashoka
By Scott Gillette

Every holiday I write a column about charitable organizations with the
vision and capabilities to solve social and economic problems on a
global basis. Last year I wrote about Lifewater International. This year
I am pleased to write about Ashoka.

The events of 9-11 focused charitable giving on the victims and heroes
in the wake of those attacks, and that's the way it should have been. I
considered an organization like the September 11th Fund as being a good
subject for this column, but everyone is aware of that charity's
efforts, while only a few may know about Ashoka. It is important to
acknowledge groups like Ashoka that dedicate themselves to solving
problems on a permanent basis, with little fanfare.
