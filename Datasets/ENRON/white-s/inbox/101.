Kim,

I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the west.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks!
Casey
