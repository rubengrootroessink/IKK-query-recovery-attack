Bob,   I just need to ask a few questions and understand any data that is stored on the O:drive ( common data).  It should only take a few minutes.  I can come to the trading floors to gather the information and will do a majority of the work.  Im trying to insure I cover all the right areas.  Sorry I did not give the details of the O:drive.  

Take Care,
Mike

Mike,

can you give me a little more detail before we start assigning people
to another task force.

Please keep in mind that during the next two weeks, most people are
going to be out

thanks

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Mike Croucher
