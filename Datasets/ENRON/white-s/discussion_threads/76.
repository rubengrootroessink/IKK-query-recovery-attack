Subject: transmission valuation in portcalc

We have deals 470788, STSW
146517, LTNW
205218, LTWTRANS
426855 LTSW

which are transmission deals.  The correlation for these are contained in the 
West Correlation file in M/power2/region.  The correlation for these delivery 
points and basis points don't match what Houston's RAROC  office has. 

Please review the attached spread sheet and email me the correlation you want 
to use for valuing the tranny deals.  As soon as we agree on the correlation 
and change them in West Correlation and/or RAROC, I'll re-run the mini-books, 
and we can release the deals into mark to market as we want.

(Matt's correlation have already been reviewed but not yet changed, you're 
done Matt.)

Please let me know if you have any questions or points of discussion.  If you 
could respond by Monday, Feb 12, that'd be good.  Thanks!
