Stacey

I am showing physical swaps on the west desk with ENA-CALfor 7.1MM.  Is this 
same as the ENA-Cal that we had max exposure for last month?   Valarie 
mentioned that something about the Power Cross Commodity book?  Could you let 
me know what book these swaps belong with?  Also are there max exposure 
numbers for ENA CAL?

I appreciate your help in this matter.

Thanks
Tracy
