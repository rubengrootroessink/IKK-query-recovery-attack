Stacey:

Starting from May 2001, per Chris Foster and Tim Belden's agreement, Chris 
Foster is calculating the origination based on the entire book P&L for the 
month, therefore basically for every deal in certain books. 

For example, he got the origination for May by the formula below:
Mid-Market Origination for May = agreed percentage * (YTD P&L as of May 31, 
2001 - YTD P&L as of April 30, 2001) 

The agreed percentage varies for each book, and for the questioned books they 
are as below:
LT-NW 12%
LT-CA 8%
LT-WMGMT 12%

Please advise how we should proceed to respond to AA.

Thanks,
Fran

forward them the information they need, but make sure you only send what they 
ask for.  Also, please cc: me on the response to AA.
