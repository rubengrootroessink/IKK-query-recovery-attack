Stacey,

Per my voicemail please find below three additional questions regarding 
Schedule
C that we will discuss at our meeting on Friday.

   Was the booking of the $26 million Modesto option reversed?
   Does Schedule C still reflect the $11.4 million related to the BPA Federal
   Surplus Clause?  Is BPA delivering power under the contract?
   Have there been any subsequent changes in the values of power options since
   the first quarter?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  Thank you.

Jennifer
