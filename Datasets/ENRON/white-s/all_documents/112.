Hi,

As requested, here are the details of the hotel nearest the Oslo Enron office 
- it is a 5 to 7 minute walk away.

Scandic Hotel Sj>lyst
Sj>lyst plass 5
PO box 173, Sk>yen  phone +47 23 15 50 00
0212 Oslo, Norway  Fax: +47 23 15 50 01

The best way to get there from the airport is to use the Airport Express rail 
service and to SKOYEN.  It goes every 15 minutes and takes about 20 minutes.  
You can get tickets at the airport and everyone speaks English.

Any questions please ask James (as I am on maternity leave from tomorrow).

Thanks,
Teresa
