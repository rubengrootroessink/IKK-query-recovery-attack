In obtaining documentation for our power dealtest, we noticed that six of our
twenty chosen deals were desk-to-desk deals.  Therefore, we have selected six
additional deals in which to test.  If these additional deals are also
desk-to-desk deals, please let me know and I will select a replacement deal.
Please provide the applicable documentation (i.e., deal ticket, curve, global
counterparty, confirmation, DCAF printout, New Deals report, contract)
corresponding with your areas of responsibility for the attached deals.


(See attached file: Additional Deal Request.xls)

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  Thank you for your 
help.

Jennifer
