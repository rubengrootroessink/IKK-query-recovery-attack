Stacey,

Please find attached the monthly power questions that we will discuss in our
meeting on Friday.

(See attached file: 2nd Quarter 2001 Power Questions.doc)


Also, as Jennifer Stevenson had discussed with you in Tuesday's opening Power
Trading meeting, we need to obtain the population of deals executed from 
1/1/01-
4/30/01.  Please let me know when we can expect to receive this information.  
If
you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  Thank you for all your 
help.

Jennifer
