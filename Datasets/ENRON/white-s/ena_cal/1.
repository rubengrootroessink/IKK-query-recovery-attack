Question:  Where does the ENA-CAL desk roll to?  I was told that it now rolls 
up to the Cross Commodity book.  Please let me know if this is correct or 
not.  I have all the physical deals on the west book with ENA-CAL attached 
below.  I have not been able to get any deal detail from the Cross Commodity 
book.

I will be sifting through and sitting with Accounting next week to get to the 
bottom of this.  No one will be taking a hit, accounting just doesn't have 
all the information.

Do we know what's going on with this deal?  Jeff Gossett just asked where we 
are with this.  It is my understanding now that Greg Whiting is asking who is 
going to take the hit.  I don't know how  West power can report a gain when 
they booked the positive annuity over to my book.  

Tracy:  Talked to IT, they said my report was not picking up the curves, will 
try to rerun in the a.m.

Have you been able to find anything out about what happened with these 
deals?  I would like to have this fixed by quarter end.

Please let me know where we stand.

Thanks
Tracy
