The BIG day is almost here, less than a month away!!  I hope everyone is as
excited as I am!!  I wanted to give you a heads up on times and what is
going on for that weekend so you can begin making plans if you haven't
already.

Friday August 10
I think some of the guys are getting together to play golf.  My dad,
grandad, brother, Kevin Galloway, and whoever else will be playing at a
location to be decided.  If you are interested and will be in Dallas Friday
morning, let Kevin or myself know.

The girls will be relaxing and taking care of last minute details (nails,
facials, tea, etc...)

Friday night
Please be at the church between 5:45 and 6:00.  Traffic can be bad at this
time of the evening, so please allow plenty of time.  In order to be at
dinner by 7:30, rehearsal must start at 6:15.  Maggiano's is five minutes
from the church so as soon as the rehearsal is over you can start drinking
beer again.

Most of our family and Jason and I are staying at AmeriSuites on Friday so
if you are staying at a hotel, try to book it there.  You need to book by
July 27 to get the discounted rate.  All the hotel information is on the
back of the directions sent with the wedding invitations.

Saturday August 12
Guys:  You are on your own, but Jason is not to hang out at the bar all
day.  (Sorry Kevin, no paybacks!)

Girls:  Luncheon is at the Zodiac room at downtown Nieman's.  If anyone
needs help with transportation, please let me know.

Wedding Time

Guys:  Please be at the church by 6:15.  You need to come dressed, but
bring your tux coat on a hanger as it will be very hot!!  Pictures will be
taken with guys and Jason's family before the ceremony.

Girls:  Please be at the church by 5:30.  You can bring your dresses, but
have hair and make up already done. Pictures will be taken with girls and
my immediate family before the ceremony.

Vocalists should be there by 6:30 to practice with organist.

House party should be there by 6:45 guest will begin arriving around 7:00.

There will not be a mass (you non-Catholics are off the hook(except
Jason!), Catholics will have to go to mass on Sunday!!)

Reception
As soon as the ceremony is over, stay around for pictures.  We are only
allowed 20 minutes so we will need to be attentive to the photographer so
he can make sure he gets all the pictures in the allotted 20 minutes.
Everyone will then go to the Tower Club downtown for the reception.  We
should be there by 8:45, unless we take a detour in the limo!!

Last call will be at 12:30 and there are plenty of places to go out
afterwards if you would like.  West end and Deep Ellum are a short cab ride
away.

I think that is everything.  Please feel free to call or E-mail me if you
have any questions!  Thank you for everyone for being a part of this
special time with Jason and I.  We look forward to seeing everyone soon!!!

Chris and Jason
