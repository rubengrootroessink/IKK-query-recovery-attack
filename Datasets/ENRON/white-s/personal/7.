US military's alert status downgraded: Rumsfeld

WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (AFP) - The US military downgraded its alert status Wednesday as tensions heightened by terrorist attacks on major US buildings a day earlier began to subside, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said. 
"We've already moved from a force protection condition called Delta, the highest level, down to Charlie, which is the next highest," Rumsfeld told NBC News.
"But we are still at a reasonably high state of alert," Rumsfeld pointed out. 
US President George W. Bush ordered troops to be placed on Threat Condition Delta following the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon building just outside Washington. 
Under the alert, immediate restrictions were put on the movements of US troops overseas, military officials said. 
All leave was canceled, and soldiers overseas were barred from attending classes, bars and clubs outside their bases. 
Rumsfeld confirmed that despite the lowering of the alert status, the US military was carrying out missions which go beyond its normal peacetime operations. 
They include, for instance, sending jet fighters to provide protective air cover over an energy complex in Houston, Texas. 
"We have a number of so-called cap flights up, as well as some AWACS and some tankers to refuel the interceptors, as well as the other aircraft that are involved," he said. "They're over a number of areas in the country." 
The defense secretary said that military aircraft at a number of bases across the country were "on strip alert," ready to respond in the event it would be appropriate.
