Hi Stacey !

Thank You for the report and for visiting us !

The old office is still vacant and we are paying.
I proposed today for Neil Austin/London and Thorstein Jenssen/Oslo that we 
should take an other
property consultant to carry the task beside Healey&Baker.

Our landlord at the new premises is Regus  (www.regus.com).
This arrangement is fine and easy to leave.
We are staying here for 1-2 years, then apartment type or Oslo/London.

Some minor notes to Your very good draft.
Ms Heidi Sieppi moved to Oslo today June 6th 2001 to work there for 6 months.

Yes, Regus Offices.

Small cameras is a very good idea !   (< 100 $ each in Finland)

To office profile I would like to add: Helsinki office's one task is to 
recruit from Finland for Enron.

On the business control side: On our expense claims are travelling and minor 
marketing expenses

Sincerely, Juhani

Juhani,
Please see the attached Preliminary Finland Doorstep Review.  What is the 
status with the old office?  Let me know if anything does not read 
correctly.  I left the office pamphlet at my house, is it Remus?

Hope all is well in Finland.  Thank you again for all your help and 
information.

Thanks,
Stacey
