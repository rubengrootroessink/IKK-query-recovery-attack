Dear Stacey and Kristin-

We can discuss more later about the attached document when we meet this morning, but thought this could help faciliate your doorstep review of UK and Continental Power.  Thanks,

Christy

Hi Christy, 

Attached is the most recent version of the Power Trading CSA.  

 
This is pretty much the definitive version, and contains the key controls.  However it is in the process of being "Andersenised" to reflect their methodology - when this has been completed (31st October) I will forward a copy for your records.    

Regards
Christabel
