Dear Stacey-

What is your view point on this?  It appears to me that what Rod is saying =
is=20
that this is not a valid doorstep finding because of the other controls tha=
t=20
they have around the process.  However, I would think that commercial havin=
g=20
a credit watch report would be beneficial at the beginning of each trading=
=20
day (or at least a list of the CP's that are approaching their limits) so=
=20
they know what CP to focus on.  What are thoughts?  Does commercial here ge=
t=20
a credit watch report daily?  Do they use it?  Please call me to discuss wh=
en=20
you get a chance.  Thanks, Stacey.  I appreciate your input.

Let=01,s discuss when Minna returns (next Monday).  Simply providing the=20
exposure relative to credit lines does not indicate that the next transacti=
on=20
is credit approved =01) and I am concerned that this would be construed as=
=20
such.  Because positions are volatile, the tenor and size of the next=20
transaction also determine approval.  As well, contractual terms play a rol=
e=20
in the approval of the next transaction.  For example, with margining right=
s=20
above a contractual level, exposure can be actively managed.  Clearly, a re=
al=20
time approach which capture exposure and potential exposure against =01+sof=
t=01,=20
and contractual lines would be ideal.  Senior management in RAC is aware of=
=20
this objective and efforts are underway to improve systems towards this end=
. =20

Nevertheless, if you think that a CreditWatch list would assist the=20
commercial team in managing credit risk in this market, I am sure that some=
=20
report could be generated periodically. =20

Dear Rod/Minna-

Thank you for the response.  I apologize for the confusion.  I understand=
=20
what is being said about the allocation of resources, but how is commercial=
=20
informed when a counterparty is approaching their credit limit?  I think th=
e=20
finding is that a real-time credit system would be ideal, but that the=20
current IT environment does not support it.  I think that what is being sai=
d=20
is that commercial should understand where counterparties stand before the=
=20
trading day starts.  Or even if just the report lists those counterparties=
=20
which are approaching their limits.  Is that something that is easily pulle=
d=20
together on a daily basis?  Please advise.  Thanks,

Christy Lobusch

Christy, Orjan:

I apologize for not responding earlier.  To be perfectly honest, I had=20
assumed that Minna Taponen (who manages credit risk for Nordic) was copied =
on=20
the correspondence.  We should probably speak to clarify on issues, but bel=
ow=20
is my initial comment.

Currently, credit is managed on a pre-approval consent basis. No counterpar=
ty=20
is approved until the commercial team has made such a request and a review =
is=20
performed and lines set.  This is not say that the =01+rules=01, are not=20
occasionally violated, but the credit approval system is in place.  RAC/CRM=
=20
could generate a CreditWatch list, but this would not necessarily improve t=
he=20
process or reduce credit risk.  Minna could produce and maintain such a=20
report, but I would require to justify that this is a worthwhile allocation=
=20
of her resource.

Thanks,
Rod

Your name is all over this...how would you like me to handle? We can do thi=

Let me know.

Dear Debbie-

I don't know if you are the person that I need to talk to, but I was hoping=
=20
you could point me to who I need to talk to about getting a credit watch=20
report distributed to the Oslo commercial team.  Also, do you know if the=
=20
issue is really that the report is not prepared and distributed or is it ju=
st=20
that the report is not distributed.  Please advise.  Thanks, Debbie.

Thanks!

Observation
No Credit Watch Report is distributed for commercial personnel to reference=
.

Root cause
Credit support has been managed in London by a RAC resource which has=20
prevented a complete set of credit tools from being developed.   =20


Action step
Agree. Credit limit monitoring should be performed on a real time basis. Th=
is=20
is being restricted by the current IT environment. In the interim a daily=
=20
report should be prepared and distributed to traders showing counterparty=
=20
limits and current utilisation of those limits.
