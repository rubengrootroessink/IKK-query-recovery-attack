I don't know if you all received comments back by Friday, but could I please get the latest draft of the doorstep reports ASAP?  Shona and I would like it to discuss with Jeff and Stacey, respectively, and we are meeting with Jeff at 10 am Tuesday.  Please advise.  Thanks,

Christy

We are still awaiting replies from Steve Stock, Georgeanne Hodges and Andrew Parsons and have given them until Friday to reply.

I would therefore expect to be able to send this over on Monday.
