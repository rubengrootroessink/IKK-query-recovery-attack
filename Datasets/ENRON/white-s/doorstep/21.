Dear Tim,

I apologize for the delay in getting this to you.  By far, your office had 
the least amount of findings and, based on the work performed by the Doorstep 
team,  I am very comfortable with the processes and procedures in place in 
the Portland office.

 I look forward to discussing this with you.

Best regards

Shona
