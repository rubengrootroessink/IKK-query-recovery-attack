I have added the comments from Mike and Orjan plus the volumes traded graph 
supplied by Orjan (thank you!).  

Please review and make any final comments and return to me by early next week 
as we need to get this to Beth's team for distribution.  

Thank you for all of your assistance on this!   Cindy
