The positions and curves are loaded by London early in the morning.  
Yesterday there was a problem with Nordic power getting into RisktRAC.  The 
MTM data was not being valued correctly and therefore was not sent to 
RisktRAC in time for the Prelim DPR.  I believe that on the whole the Nordic 
info gets into RisktRAC on time.  

The P&L is sent to Johnny via the London Summary.  Nordic Power has its own 
line on the DPR for positions, maturity gap, var and p&l.

Johnny tells me that the positions and maturity gap, reported for Nordic 
Power by London, change from the preliminary DPR to the final DPR.  You might 
ask them if there is a reason for that.  

I hope the trip has been successful.  

Anything else, let me know.


Chris

Do you receive Oslo's official books on a consistent basis with no problems 
into RisktRAC?  Is there P&L reported separately on the consolidated DPR?
