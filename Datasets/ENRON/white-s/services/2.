Folks,

We are getting very close on an agreement with Intergen.  In the interest of having as many eyes on this as possible, can all of you please review this and we will meet next week to review any remaining concerns.

Thanks,

Tom

Here is my turn from Kay's draft transmitted this morning (clean and blackline).  In my estimation, this puts us very close.  Please fill in the blanks in 6.1 and 10.1.
This is still subject to InterGen and lender review and possible modification, but it looks like we are there.
