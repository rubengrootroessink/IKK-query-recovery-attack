Valentine and Jayant.  We can telecon you in.  

Thresa Allen and I would like to hold a weekly meeting to discuss ERCOT activities as a group.  For our first meeting, we would like ESCA to provide a review and status of the system development efforts thus far.  In addition we would like to cover the systems plan for volume mngt and settlements.  

On a weekly basis, we will only meet for 30 min to an hour to cover status of our progress for the week.  I'll send out a separate meeting notice for the weekly meeting.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.  

Thank you.  

Debra
