You have been scheduled to take a floor tour Tuesday, October 30, 2001 at 9am.  

This will be our last opportunity for a floor tour before the move and we are only 
allowed (9) attendees.  Therefore, if for any reason you will not be able to attend,
please let me know as soon as possible so that someone else may be able to
attend in your place.  

We will meet at 9am promptly in the sky ring just before the ECS Badge Access 
in front of the garage entrance. 

Many Thanks, 

Heather Choate, x33278
