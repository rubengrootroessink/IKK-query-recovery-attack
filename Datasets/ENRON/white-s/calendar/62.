Background
A few months ago, an operational risk forum luncheon was established to discuss potential and actual operational risk issues within Enron North America.  The forum met every two weeks to discuss items related to both internal and external factors of operational risk that impact Enron.

Change of focus
Based on discussions with a number of you it was decided that it would be advantageous to open this forum to all of Global Risk Management Operations, and this memo serves as your invitation.  

Meeting coordination & attendance
Going forward, I will be coordinating the topics for discussion and will send each of you an agenda before the meeting so you can determine whether or not you would like to attend the meeting.  I welcome all suggestions regarding topics for discussion.

The first meeting is planned for the 12th. Due to the all employee meeting from 10-12, this meeting will start at 12 and go to 1.  Lunch will be provided.

Agenda
The first meeting topics will be:

- update on task forces
- update on operational standards & exception reporting
- update on compliance with risk policy

Your requirements
Please let Pamela Sonnier know if you (or a rep from your group) will be attending the meeting so she knows how many people to order lunch for.
Calgary and London - Pam will coordinate phone line call ins for you.
