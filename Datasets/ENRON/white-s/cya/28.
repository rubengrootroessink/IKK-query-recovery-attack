I spoke with Stuart Zisman and he assured me that there are no deals being considered for assignment in relation to the sale of New Albany.

As you may or may not know, we are in the processing of selling New Albany.  Does the Capacity Payment that was marked in January $12.5MM need to be unwound with the sale?  If so, what is the impact if it is unwound at 9/30/01.  I am putting together a calculation on the gain or loss on sale and I need this information before it can be distributed.

Thanks!
