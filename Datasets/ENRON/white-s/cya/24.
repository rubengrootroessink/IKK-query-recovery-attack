It is okay with me.

Stacey, since I am coming to Houston on Oct 11 and 12, I was planning to stay over a Sat night to save some money. Without staying over the Sat the ticket is currently at about 1,600 but the ticket I purchased is at about 250. Since I would be in Houston for 5 days I would like Jess to come down at that time. Would Enron be willing to buy Jess' ticket as well since I would be staying over the Sat? Her ticket would be some where around 400 since prices have changed in the last few days. I would be paying for Brandon's ticket.
