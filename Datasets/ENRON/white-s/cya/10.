Where did she get this information?  Is it a below the line adjustment (not in the DPR)?

Per Louise, the $1.1MM loss on sale was flashed and booked to Presto.

Stacey,

Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 

Do we need to get together to discuss this?
