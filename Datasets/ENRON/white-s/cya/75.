Just wanted you to be aware that a couple of weeks ago we made many curve changes.  We have been in communication with EES, but there continue to be problems.  We may have not communicated with all the correct people.  I know Kenneth Lee, Preston Ochsner, and Jeff Jackson are in the loop, but it seems they are not passing off the communication within EES.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Stacey

Jennifer, 

Please see e-mail below which was sent to EES on 6/14 regarding the deactivation of the R4A curve.

Thanks.
Casey

Preston,

After today, two additional curves will be "inactivated".  They are:

R2 - Ecar
R4A - Mapp

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks.
Casey

Dear all,

Because the curve (R4A) for Ontario region was not loaded, I was not able to run portcalc to generate the Enpower report.  However, I will run portcalc again and officialize the report tomorrow morning as early as possible.  I apologize for any inconvenience this caused.

Regards,
