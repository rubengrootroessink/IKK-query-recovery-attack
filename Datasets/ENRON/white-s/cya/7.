We intend to reserve $5.5 million associated with PX Index-based deals with=
 third parties that we did in January.  The $5.5 million represents the amo=
unt by which we underpaid some of our services customers relative to the PX=
 index.  NO P&L IMPACT.  Amounts currently sitting as annuities in Enpower.=
  We should release this reserve when the California refund case is complet=
ed and new/final PX MCPs are published by FERC.

The story goes like this ... We typically buy power from our services custo=
mers at a PX Index price.  Throughout January we entered PX Index based pur=
chases from our services customers into Enpower.  At the same time, Foster =
was negotiating a certain $150/MWh payment to our customers given all of th=
e noise around the PX, the weird prices that it was printing, and the $150/=
MWh soft price cap that FERC had in place.  We settled with our customers b=
ased on the $150 value.  Most of our customers were fine with this.  To do =
this we entered annuities into Enpower for the difference between the PX pr=
ice and the $150 price.  These annuities have been "hanging out there" sinc=
e January.  We should have run those annuities through the books and reserv=
ed the amount when we settled with our customers (I am assured by Foster an=
d Postelthwaite that we have properly settled with our customers).  Somewhe=
re between our middle market team and our risk group in Portland the annuit=
ies were never run through the books (you may recall that we lost two of ou=
r three people on our risk desk at this same time).  Foster or Wolfe should=
 have caught this.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Just double checking that you have already talked to Lavo about these.

Thanks,

Dear all,

Just a heads-up to everyone, the Risk will reserve $5,518,289.90 on 10/31/0=
1 in the ST-CA books regarding the following four annuity deals:

#566310=09$1,885,593.81
#566307=09$1,383,042.10
#566313=09$1,539,749.09
#566377=09$   709,904.90
Total=09=09$5,518,289.90

As discussed earlier, since these deals have never come through to ST-CA bo=
ok, we will give this value back to ST-CA while reserving it at the same ti=
me. Therefore, there will be NO P&L impact for ST-CA.=20

Tracy,

We are treating this just like the way we discussed in the last email (10/2=
4). Therefore, you should be able to take them out from the LTD report in N=
ov.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
