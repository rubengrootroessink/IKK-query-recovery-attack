Regarding that BPA sch C. The James River deal was torn up when the Open access was taken away. That is why it is not in the system. Mike Swerzbin is expecting open access to return in April and they will put the deal in then and probably release the sch c against it.

I told Trey that we are still obligated to the deal and that we are anticipating the return of open access and the probable release of the sch c. I didn't mention the James River piece.
