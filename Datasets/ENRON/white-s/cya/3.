Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.
