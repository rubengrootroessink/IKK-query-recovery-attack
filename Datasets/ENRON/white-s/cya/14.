Zakiyyah - in response to your email below, please set this book up in RisktRAC as a power book.  Apparently this book has already been set up in GCP and you mentioned below that it is also set up in ERMS.  I don't know why it was set up in ERMS since it's a power book but make sure to mention this to the GCP team.  Also, make sure to place this book in the hierarchy under AGG-ACCRUALS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Susan

Susan,

This emails relates to your email of last Thursday asking us to create this accrual book.  When you have some time, let's discuss this one.  I looked in Risktrac and this one is not there, but it is in ERMS.  How does this happen?  Should this book be placed in the AGG Accruals hierarchy?  

Please advise. I will hold off on adding anything until we can discuss.

Thank you.

Zakiyyah

The book I requested is actually already set up in GCP.  I looked for it on the Active/Inactive website and could not find it, so I assumed it was not in RisktRAC.  This book just needs to be added to the Accrual Hierarchy in RisktRAC.

Stacey,

I did leave a message with someone at your desk.  Please complete the following information so that we will be able to set up your power book.  As well, when will you have positions in this book?

Thank you.
