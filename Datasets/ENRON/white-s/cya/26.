Subject:	Curve Changes

In conjunction with a new "curve layout" requested by Kevin Presto, we will be carrying out several curve changes for East Power.  I wanted to go ahead and send what curve requests I had available currently, but I will be sending additional ones as I complete them.  The new curve requests are as follows:


   


Also, we are requesting that several curves be made "inactive" and they are as follows:

R1H - NE Dispatch
R2B - Eastern Ecar
B11 - Wisconsin
B33 - NY Zone D


Please DO NOT hesitate to call me if you have any questions!  This is not a joyous project, I know, so I greatly appreciate your help!!
