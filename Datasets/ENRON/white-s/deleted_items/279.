Thanks,
Just to let you know.  We have moved everything terminated out of the alberta ena book into the albert ena bankruptcy book.  The only deal left in the alberta ena book is a deal with Nexen so when they terminate please let me know.
Thanks
Kathy

Stacey,
Would I also be able to get this calculation as of the 28th.  This would have been backed with deals between ECC and ENA and these deals were terminated Dec 28th.
