Stacey,
Yes, these numbers are in C$ but I think I can get a calc to work in US$.  I calc'd a book 15900.  The deal summary report looks right but adhoc doesn't - I think becuase I am still in the middle of changing deals and it didn't like the duplucate deals.  I'll test again with tonight's calc.  But if I get it to work you should be able to get US$ MTM numbers straight from the calc, without any additional conversion required.  Note though that the liquidations (in both the DPR automation - Schedule A and any liquidation reports will still by in C$).

Are the numbers in Canadian $'s?  If so, can you send me conversions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Thanks
I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

Would you be able to send me a list of ENA terminations.  I am going to start moving the deals to the Alberta ENA terminations book
