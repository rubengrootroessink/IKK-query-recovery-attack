Did you know?
     "Livid" has a colorful history. The Latin adjective
"lividus" means "dull, grayish, or leaden blue." From this came
the French "livide," and eventually the English "livid," which
originally was used to describe flesh discolored by a bruise.
By the end of the 18th century, a slight extension of meaning
had given it the sense "ashen or pallid," as in describing a
corpse. "Livid" eventually came to be used in this sense to
characterize the complexion of a person pale with anger ("livid
with rage"). From this meaning came two new senses in the 20th
century. One was "reddish," as one is as likely to become red
with anger as pale; the other was simply "angry" or "furious,"
the most common sense of the word today.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
