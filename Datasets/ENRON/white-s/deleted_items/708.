The Word of the Day for October 23 is:

omnibus   \AHM-nih-bus\   (adjective)
     1 : of, relating to, or providing for many things at once
    *2 : containing or including many items

Example sentence:
     The state legislature approved an omnibus amendment that
included an array of measures encompassing everything from
education to workplace safety.

Did you know?
     The adjective "omnibus" may not have much to do with public
transportation, but the noun "omnibus" certainly does -- it not
only means "bus," it's also the word we shorten to form "bus."
The noun "omnibus" originated in the 1820s as a French word for
long, horse-drawn vehicles that transported people along the
main thoroughfares of Paris. Shortly thereafter, omnibuses --
and the noun "omnibus" -- arrived in New York. But in Latin,
"omnibus" simply means "for all." Our adjective "omnibus,"
which arrived in the mid-1800s, seems to hark back to that
Latin "omnibus," though it may also have been at least
partially influenced by the English noun. An "omnibus bill"
containing numerous provisions, for example, could be likened
to a bus loaded with people.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
