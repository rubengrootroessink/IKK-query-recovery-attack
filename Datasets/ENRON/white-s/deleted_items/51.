The Word of the Day for February 4 is:

eccentric   \ik-SEN-trik or ek-SEN-trik\   (adjective)
     1 a : not of the usual or normal kind *b : acting or
thinking in an unusual way
     2 : deviating from a circular path; especially
: elliptical

Example sentence:
     "Joyce is a little eccentric, to say the least," said
Melvin, "but I actually find her quirky personality to be quite
refreshing."

Did you know?
     "Eccentric" comes to us through Middle English from the
Medieval Latin word "eccentricus," but it is ultimately derived
from a combination of the Greek words "ex," meaning "out of,"
and "kentron," meaning "center." The original meaning of
"eccentric" in English was "not having the same center" (as in
"eccentric spheres"). In this sense, it contrasts with
"concentric," meaning "having a common center" (as in
"concentric circles, one within another"). But since at least
1630, English speakers have also used "eccentric" to describe
individuals who are figuratively off-center. It can also be
used to describe something that doesn't follow a truly circular
path, as in "an eccentric orbit."

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
