I couldn't remember who he was dressed as. I just remember all of us having laughing pretty hard when they sent that to us.

I don't know where all those pictures are.  We received them online, so I am sure they are lost.  Donnie may have them.  Remember, he was dressed as Austin Powers.

This reminded me of the year we got the email picture from the West group when they were dressed up for halloween. Do you know if that is still floating around anywhere?
