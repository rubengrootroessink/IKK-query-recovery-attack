This is funny....

       FROM A LADY ONLINE.........
       I don't know who David is, but his response is
       hilarious!!!

       Ya know.......some people look for things like
       this...and it
       amazes me.
       At  first I rolled my eyes....then I read Dave's
       response and I
       couldn't
       have  said it better if I had all day to do it.

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Original Letter:

        The date of the attack: 9/11 -  9 + 1 + 1 = 11
        September 11th is the 254th day of the year: 2 + 5 + 4 = 11
        After September 11th there are 111 days left to the end of the
        year.
        119 is the area code to Iraq/Iran. 1 + 1 + 9 = 11
        Twin Towers - standing side by side, looks like the number 11
        The first plane to hit the towers was Flight 11

        I Have More.......

        State of New York - The 11th State added to the Union
        New York City - 11 Letters
        Afghanistan - 11 Letters
        The Pentagon - 11 Letters
        Ramzi Yousef - 11 Letters (convicted of orchestrating the attack
        at the WTC in 1993)
        Flight 11 - 92 on board - 9 + 2 = 11
        Flight 77 - 65 on board - 6 + 5 = 11


       Dave's response:

       Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11
       letters in the name "David Pawson!"
       I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a
       few weeks.

        Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also
        has 11 letters!
        What am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after
        me! ME! I can't believe it!

        Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet
        Earth I could hide!
        But no ..."PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!

        Maybe Nostradamus can help me. But dare I trust
        him? There are 11 letters in  "NOSTRADAMUS."

        I know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't...
        11 letters in "THE RED CROSS ," can't trust them.

        I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
        has 11 letters in it, too!
        Can someone help?

        Anyone? If so, send me email. No, don't... "SEND
        ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

        Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING
        INSANE???" Eleven letters!!

        Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even
        though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has 11 letters.....

        Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed!
        Our Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4=11!

       ~Dave

        PS. "IT'S BULLSHIT" has 11 letters also.
