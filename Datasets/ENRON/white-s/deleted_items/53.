The Word of the Day for February 2 is:

benefic   \buh-NEH-fik\   (adjective)
     : of, having, or exerting a favorable or beneficent
influence

Example sentence:
     Simone believes that her meditation practice is a benefic
force in her life, helping her to focus and to find inner peace.

Did you know?
     "Benefic" comes from Latin "bene facere," meaning "to do
good to." The word was originally used by astrologers to refer
to celestial bodies believed to have a favorable influence, and
it's still used in astrological contexts. "Benefic," "beneficent,"
and "beneficial" are all synonyms, but there are shades of
difference. "Beneficial" usually applies to things that promote
health or well-being (as "beneficial treatment"), or that
provide some benefit or advantage (as in "beneficial classes").
"Beneficent" means doing or effecting good (as "a beneficent
climate"), but in particular refers to the performance of acts
of kindness or charity (as "a beneficent organization").
"Benefic," the rarest of the three, tends to be a bit high-flown,
and it's mostly used to describe a favorable power or force.
