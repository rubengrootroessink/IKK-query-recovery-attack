Are you available?  If not give us 10 minutes this morning to discuss.

We think the best option is to balance the month with a sale/purchase at $R0 price and push the income and cash payment/receipt into the future.  Remi is giving us a Dec 2002 expected settlement date which is discounted at about 25%.

Other than Lavo's approval does there have to been sound rationale for a Schedule C for AA?

Please plan to attend a meeting in my office (ECno 2328) at 1:45 today.

Britaldo, Peccio & possibly Remi will be calling me @ 2:00 to discuss establishing an official policy for recording trades, receivables and related "reserves" for deals.

Martha, I think this will link back to our discussion last week and the decision to "schedule C" some amount for the liquidity issue.

Thanks,
Jody
