I've done the 12/31 adhoc queries for this and have saved it in the 'New' folder...12-31 AdHoc - Performing Counterparties.  Once we move the counterparties to the Perv (I mean Perf) book we can use this file to determine the prior days associated.

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.
