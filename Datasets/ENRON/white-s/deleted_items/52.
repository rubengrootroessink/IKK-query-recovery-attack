The Word of the Day for February 3 is:

conquian   \KONG-kee-un\   (noun)

games of rummy developed

Example sentence:

Did you know?
     "Conquian" is a very old card game, played more frequently
in the past than it is now. It is based upon the "draw and
discard" principle that forms the basis for all modern games of
rummy and is played with 40 cards, setting aside certain cards
of a 52-card deck. (The most common variations involve the
removal of either all face cards, or the tens, nines, and eights.)
The goal of the game is to form three or four of a kind, or
sequences. "Conquian" comes to us from Mexican Spanish, but the
word is ultimately derived from the Spanish "con quien," meaning
"with whom?"
