The Word of the Day for January 25 is:

corybantic   \kor-ee-BAN-tik or kahr-ee-BAN-tik\   (adjective)
     : like or in the spirit of a Corybant; especially : wild,
frenzied

Example sentence:
     Thousands of corybantic fans writhed and screamed in a
frenzied dance to the driving guitars and the pounding beat of
the rock band "Steel Sweat."

Did you know?
     The big name in goddesses in Phrygia (Asia Minor) in the
fifth century B.C. was Cybele (also called Cybebe or Agdistis),
the "Great Mother of the Gods." According to Oriental and Greco-
Roman mythology, she was the mother of it all -- gods, humans,
animals, plants, nature itself. The Corybants were Cybele's
mythical attendants, and they worshipped her with an unrestrained
frenzy of wildly emotional processions, rites, and dances.
"Corybantic," the adjective based on the name of Cybele's
attendants, can be used to describe anything characterized by a
similar unrestrained abandon.
