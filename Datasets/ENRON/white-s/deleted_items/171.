Kristin, the deal with ECC was moved from PWR-NG-WEST-GD to RISKMANTRA trading book. However the basis book is still showing as  PWR-NG-WEST-GD. I cannot choose RISKMANTRA as a basis book. If you think I should be using a different book let me know. The deal number is VF8830.

Amigos,
I was looking at our non-terminated financial deals and found these (in the spreadsheet).  Aside from the EES stuff, which I still don't know how to treat, do you think we could get rid of these intercompany trades.  I am happy to track down answers if there are questions about what we should be doing with them, but if it is a matter of just killing them or moving them to the Bankruptcy books, can you guys do that?
Thanks,
Kristin
