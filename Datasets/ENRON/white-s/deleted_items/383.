Thinking out loud, I think we need one more test for RAC and CAS.  We need to test a heterogeneous portfolio that has both gas and power books.  This way we can test curve shift pnl data, benchmark quantities, etc?
 
Since we know the above "fields" may potentially be wrong because of legacy code, this test would for sure let's us know what really is wrong, instead of suspicions.
 
Your ideas?

Frank

Everyone,
 
I have attached the preliminary schedule for tomorrow's test of the integration test scripts. For those individuals, who have been identified to participate in the test and are unable to attend at your scheduled time, please send me the name of your substitute as soon as possible. The current schedule allows plenty of time for each step. If the test is ahead of schedule, we may call you in at an earlier time.
 
Thank You,
 
Terry
