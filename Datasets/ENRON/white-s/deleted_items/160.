The Word of the Day for January 24 is:

ascetic   \uh-SEH-tik\   (adjective)
     1 : practicing strict self-denial as a measure of personal
and especially spiritual discipline
    *2 : austere in appearance, manner, or attitude

Example sentence:
     Ms. Walter's plain, dark clothing and tight bun give her
an ascetic appearance, but she is actually very warm and fun-
loving.

Did you know?
     "Ascetic" comes from "asketikos," a Greek adjective meaning
"laborious." Ultimately, it comes from the Greek verb "askein,"
which means "exercise" or "work." There aren't many other English
words from "askein," but there's no dearth of synonyms for
"ascetic." "Severe" and "austere," for example, are two words
that share with "ascetic" the basic meaning "given to or marked
by strict discipline and firm restraint." "Ascetic" implies
abstention from pleasure and comfort or self-indulgence as
spiritual discipline, whereas "severe" implies standards enforced
without indulgence or laxity and may suggest harshness (as in
"severe military discipline"). "Austere" stresses absence of
warmth, color, or feeling and may apply to rigorous restraint,
simplicity, or self-denial (as in "living an austere life in the
country").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
