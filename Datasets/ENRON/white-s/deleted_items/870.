Stacey:

	The first place to look is the Legal Entities Rules Table, in Table Edit.  Donnie is the most knowledgeable with regard to these rules.

Can you send me (or tell me where to access) the matrix put together which defines the legal entity for each desk.  Debbie Brackett informed me that the entities are not necessarily the 'legal' entity but something else and I need to help get to the bottom of this.

Thanks,
Stacey
