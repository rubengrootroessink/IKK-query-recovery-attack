We will be needing a tool modified in Port Calc.  In the Report drop-down menu, there is a report called "New Mark to Market Detail Report" which pulls the net asset and net liability value for each deal by counterparty.  Currently, the tool will query according to post id.  However, we will need to be able to extract this information by desk, also.  Can one of you help us out with this?!

Let me know if you have further questions!
Thanks!
Casey
