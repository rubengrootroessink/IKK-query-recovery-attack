The Word of the Day for January 13 is:

deem   \DEEM\   (verb)
    *transitive sense : to come to think or judge : consider
     intransitive sense : to have an opinion : believe

Example sentence:
     Upon discovering that they had collected a combined total
of more than one thousand dollars, the students deemed their
class fund-raiser a resounding success.

Did you know?
     In the Middle Ages, "demen" was a fateful word. Closely
related to "doom," this precursor of "deem" meant "to act as a
judge" or "to sentence, condemn, or decree." These meanings
passed to "deem" itself, but we haven't used "deem" to mean
"legally condemn" since the early 17th century. Though "deem"
is still frequently used in law contexts, today it means
"judge" only in a broader sense of "to decide (something
specified) regarding," as in "the act was deemed unlawful"
or "the defendant is deemed to have agreed to the contract."
Outside of the law, "deem" usually means simply "to consider."
Some usage commentators consider "deem" pretentious, but its
use is well established in both literary and journalistic
contexts. We deem it perfectly acceptable.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
