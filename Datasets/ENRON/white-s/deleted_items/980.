Hey!  Just wanted to say thanks for the  Birthday Card.  Also, sorry we didn't get to see each other over the  weekend.  I was so excited because I was actually going to be able to give  you Fortune's Rocks back!  Can you believe I finished it?  It only  took me 3 months!  Now I am reading your To Tame a Texan's Heart.  So  maybe I will have it finished by the next time we see each other.
 
Have y'all seen any good movies  lately?  We went for my birthday and saw Don't Say a Word.  Couldn't  decide between that or Training Day.  Should have seen Training Day.   I was disappointed in the other one.  Of course Lamar said "I told you  so".
 
Well, I will let you go.  Take  care.
 
Love,
Karyn
