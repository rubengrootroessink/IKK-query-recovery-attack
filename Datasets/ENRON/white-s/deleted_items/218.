From the same list of original 11/30 East and West post ids, can you obtain the total number of deals in all of the calcs?!  (i.e. one grand total of transactions for the East and West)

What we want is active transactions, hence, how many deals do we have in the book as of 11/30?

I thought I could answer this question.  Can you provide more clarity?

no, that can't be right, hence "clear as mud".  we can have an "open" position overall with a counterparty or overall with a region, but there is no such thing as an "open" transaction?!

define it as open positions.  if you have a long and a short offsetting with a counterparty, then there is not an open transaction.

clear as mud?

FYI- The request in the attachment for "Number of Active Transactions as of 11/30"  should actually read, "Number of Active Counterparties as of 11/30".  I hope this helps clarify the request.

Thanks,
Chris

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.
