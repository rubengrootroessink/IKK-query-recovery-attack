Folks:

We would like to invite you and yours to our house to watch the Nebraska and Oklahoma football game on Saturday.  To give you some context regarding this game, in Nebraska, this game is practically a religious event that inspires frightening amounts of fervor.  Plus, this year both teams are unbeaten, so be forewarned. . .this is serious business. Come and join us this Saturday at 11am, and find out for yourself.  There is an invite with directions, a map, and times in the Word document below.  If for some reason, you cannot open the document, please let us know and we'll give you the appropriate info through another route.

Tom, Cheryl, Mike, and Baby James
