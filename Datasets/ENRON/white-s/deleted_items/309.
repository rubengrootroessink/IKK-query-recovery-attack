FYI..if you have any shortcuts for Enpower applications on your desktop, you will need to change the path of the database from pwrprodn_ded to estpwrpn

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the "PWRPRODN" or "PWRPRODN_DED" database aliases to "ESTPWRPN".

Thanks,  David Poston
