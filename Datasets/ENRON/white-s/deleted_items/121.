The Word of the Day for January 29 is:

logy   \LOH-ghee\   (adjective)
     : marked by sluggishness and lack of vitality : groggy

Example sentence:
     The climbers began to feel logy and disoriented from the
combination of the high altitude and the energy they had
expended during the climb.

Did you know?
     Based on surface resemblance, you might guess that "logy"
(also sometimes spelled "loggy") is related to "groggy," but
that's not the case. "Groggy" comes from "Old Grog," the
nickname of an English admiral who was notorious for his cloak
made of a fabric called grogram, and for adding water to his
crew's rum. The sailors called the rum mixture "grog" after the
admiral. Because of the effect of grog, "groggy" came to mean
"weak and unsteady on the feet or in action." No one is really
sure about the origin of "logy", but experts speculate that it
comes from the Dutch word "log," meaning "heavy." Its first
recorded use in English, from an 1847 London newspaper, refers
to a "loggy stroke" in rowing.
