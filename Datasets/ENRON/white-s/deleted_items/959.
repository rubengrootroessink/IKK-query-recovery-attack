The Word of the Day for October 17 is:

circadian   \ser-KAY-dee-un\   (adjective)
      : being, having, characterized by, or occurring in
approximately 24-hour periods or cycles (as of biological
activity or function)

Example sentence:
     "Set regular times for going to bed and waking up to
promote predictable circadian rhythms." (_Washingtonian_,
June 2001)

Did you know?
     Fifty years ago, no one talked about "circadian rhythms" --
because "circadian" hadn't even been coined yet. In 1959, a
scientist formed the word from the Latin words "circa" ("about")
and "dies" ("day"), and it became popular pretty quickly.
"Circadian" appeared in periodicals throughout the sixties, and
appeared in a Merriam-Webster dictionary before the decade was
up. Most often, it's seen and heard in the term "circadian
rhythm," which refers to the inherent cycle of about 24 hours
that appears to control various biological processes, such as
sleep, wakefulness, and digestive activity. If you want to
impress your friends, you can also use the term "circadian
dysrhythmia," a fancy synonym of "jet lag."
