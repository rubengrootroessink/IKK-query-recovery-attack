Did you know?
     When you reach the zenith, you're at the top, the pinnacle,
the summit, the peak. "Zenith" developed from Arabic terms
meaning "the way over one's head." As long ago as the 1300s,
English speakers used "zenith" to name the highest point in the
celestial heavens, directly overhead. By the 1600s, "zenith" was
being used in English for other high points as well.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
