Shona,

Please let us know what information for Power you are not able to obtain from other sources, and we will proceed with pulling the information.  We are currently overloaded with requests from both the estate side and the netco side so we would not be able to fulfill the entire request immediately.

Thanks.
Casey

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.
