     Christina,

     Hello-
     I've asked Lisa Haughton to setup a dial in number for these daily
     calls since it might be easier - starting with Tues Feb. 5.

     Lisa will e-mail you with the details.

     thanks
     Liliana

Sally has a Dr.'s Appt. on Monday, Feb. 4, therefore she has asked that I move t
he meeting time (Mon. Feb. 4 only) to review the task list from 9:00am to "11:00
 am CST".  For those of you outside the office, please let me know if you would
like for me to conference you in by phone.

Unless you are scheduled to be on vacation, please make every effort to attend t
hese meetings daily so we can assure all tasks are updated.


Thank you,
