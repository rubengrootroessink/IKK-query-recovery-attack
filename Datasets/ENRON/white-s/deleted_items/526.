I found out where the retail number is coming from. You are picking up an EES West portfolio which is incorrect. That is our test env't only and not in production.

Please see the power export tab information to see the positions and maturity gap numbers being exported to the DPR.  In case you need to see further detail, I have saved the power bench report under O:Dropbox, PWRB_1025_PWR_V@R_NEW.xls.  I will save the power bench report under the dropbox on a daily basis.  Please contact me if you have any questions.  

Thank you,
Susan
