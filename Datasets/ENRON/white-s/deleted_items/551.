The Word of the Day for October 26 is:

magnanimous   \mag-NAN-uh-mus\   (adjective)
     1 : showing or suggesting a lofty and courageous spirit
    *2 : showing or suggesting nobility of feeling and
generosity of mind

Example sentence:
     Jane was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to
win and praising her opponent's skill.

Did you know?
     When you see "anima," "animus," or a similar formation in
a word, it's an indicator of something alive, lively, or
spirited. Something "animated" is full of life, for example,
and an "animal" is a living, breathing thing. The Latin word
"animus" means "soul" or "spirit." In "magnanimous," that
"animus" is joined by the Latin "magnus," meaning "great."
Basically meaning "greatness of spirit," "magnanimity" is the
opposite of pettiness. A truly magnanimous person can lose
without complaining and win without gloating. Angry disputes
can sometimes be resolved when one side makes a magnanimous
gesture toward another.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
