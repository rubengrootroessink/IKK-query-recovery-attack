I am now getting 4 official post ids from EnPower for the bankruptcy books.  We used to get only 2 (East and West).  Should we be getting four (4)?  For the 4th of January we got the following Post IDS


POST_ID
15616
15622
15623
15628

Were those correct ?  If let us know when we should be getting a larger count on a daily basis.

John
