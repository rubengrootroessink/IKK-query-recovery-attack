Subject:	Script Needed

There are additional counterparties which need to have their primary counterparty changed on all active deals....just as we've done previously...to East Performance or West Performance.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which lists the secondary counterparty codes for all of these entities, separated according to East or West portfolio.

We would like to be able to run the script tomorrow morning, if possible.

Please call if you have any questions. 
Thanks!
Casey
