The Word of the Day for January 11 is:

wherewithal   \WHAIR-with-awl\   (noun)
     : means, resources; specifically : money

Example sentence:
     It was obvious to Grace that her old car was on its last
legs, but she didn't have the wherewithal to replace it.

Did you know?
     "Wherewithal" has been with us in one form or another since
the 16th century. It comes from "where" and "withal" (meaning
"with"), and it has been used as a conjunction meaning "with or
by means of which" and as a pronoun meaning "that with or by
which." These days, however, it is almost always used as a noun
referring to the means or resources one has at one's disposal
-- especially financial resources, i.e., money.
