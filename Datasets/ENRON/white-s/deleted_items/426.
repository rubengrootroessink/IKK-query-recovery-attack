We would really like to try to have all of the information related to PSEG by the end of this week.  Please let me know if this is not possible.

Thanks,
Laurel

We are in the process of trying to reach a final settlement with PSEG for all remaining settlements and MTM value of the future contracts.  They would like to finalize this by tomorrow or early next week.  I have told them that could be very difficult.  They would like to know when you expect the final reconciled numbers to be available.  

Jeff/Stacey/Michelle, 
Could you send me the MTM value for all Jan '02 and forward emissions, gas and power deals.

Thanks,
Laurel

I am helping Ed Baughman negotiate a final settlement with PSEG, and was wondering if you could send me the final Nov and Dec numbers for Fin and Phy gas, Fin and Phy Power and Emissions.  Please let me know when you expect to have the numbers available.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Laurel Bolt
