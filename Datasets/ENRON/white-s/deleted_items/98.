Chris,
 
The Performing/Non-Performing separation for power was not even done until mid-Jan, so there is no way to provide p&l on the comparative positions back in Dec.  Basically, our MTD, QTD and YTD p&l is all the same amount.
 
Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks!
Casey

Several groups have asked about the "11/30 to date" column on the DPR and what should be included in that number.  The intent was to report the p&l activity since Enron filed for bankruptcy, therefore including December p&l and January to date p&l, for the current DPR.  However, the question of whether we have the ability to include December's p&l is open.  The report should not include active deals which we do not intend to perform on, but those deals may not have been removed by the end of December from everyone's p&l.  
 
Please let me know if this is the case for your books.
 
Thanks,
Chris

To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the attached spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
 
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.   
 
Thanks,
