Casey,
 
A plan to complete the "J9" issue has been reached.
 
Basically, the solution is based on the following key point:
The number that is used to correct "J9" is from "Swap Liq.xls".  
 
Swap Liq.xls procedures and functions are: 
1: manually Via PortCol to ftp two files to local PC 
2 gets a comparison result between a pare of swap liq under the same region/book based on the two files
 
The design for this project is:
1: to save time, AUTOMATICALLY/DIRECTLY AND  WITHOUT Via PortCol  to ftp all files to a M Folder. The files are belonged to a giving portfolio and date 
2. compare Swap Liq for all pair files (for every pair,  the comparison result  just is exact as current "Swap Liq.xls")
3. if a difference is found from a pair files,  then value in "J9" in the desk tab and the region roll file will be changhed to "J9 minus the number" and the number also will be put in the column based on the date
4. the partially or all of above procedures may with or separate from DprAutomation if there is necessary
 
I need confirm with you about EXACTLY PROCEDURE about HOW TO GET THE NUMBER FROM "Swap Liq.xls" to  correct "J9". One of the macros will basically functions the way you give to me.
 
Also what is the title for new column in roll file for Swap Liq. 
 
The short term goal for this project is to try to make J9 work at the correct way under acceptable time period (in 20 minutes for a portfolio) before Netco starts trading. Long term goal will be speed and better interface or even reach a solution to take care this once for all from AdHoc database table. 
 
Please let me know when you have chance to guide me through/or e-mail the procedure about how to get the number to correct J9.
 
Please let me know if there is any concern. 
 
Thank you very much!
