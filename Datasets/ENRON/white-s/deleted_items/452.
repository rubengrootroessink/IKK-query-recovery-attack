Melissa Allen and I are working on Ectric for Eric Shaw in London and are supposed to have a teleconference today with Barry Pearce on what is happening on Ectric.   When were you wanting this information back to you?  Thanks Cindy

after thinking about the schedule from Barry, I think that the following schedule is the one that should be completed.  I believe that this schedule will provide more information about what items may be more recoverable than others.  Also it will help ask questions as to what we really believe on recovery values. If you have any questions, please call.

Also who has information on ECTRIC?

Kent

Attached is a soft copy of the sheet we discussed earlier.

After chatting with Jim, I've removed EES and additionally added Canada.
