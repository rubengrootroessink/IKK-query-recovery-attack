The Word of the Day for January 16 is:

frigorific   \frih-guh-RIH-fik\   (adjective)
     : causing cold : chilling

Example sentence:
     Jamie shivered as she faced the frigorific blast of wind
blowing off the lake.

Did you know?
     The chill in "frigorific" comes from "frigus," the Latin
word for "frost" or "cold." ("Frigorific" is derived from the
Latin "frigorificus," the adjective form of "frigus.") "Frigus"
has provided us with other icy words as well. It is the source
of "refrigerate" ("to keep cold"), and also of the combining
form "frigo-" ("cold") and the noun "frigorimeter" ("a
thermometer designed for low temperatures"), both of which are
primarily scientific and somewhat rare. "Frigus" is also
related to the ancestors of "frigid" ("intensely cold").
"Frigorific" is a relatively unusual word and is used
considerably less often than its relatives "refrigerate" and
"frigid."
