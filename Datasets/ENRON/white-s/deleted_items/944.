All,

Move time is fast approaching!!!!  IT will be performing a workstation audit on everyone who will be moving to ECS.  This audit is a physical audit of all your IT equipment (computer, telephone, printers, etc.) to document the equipment for each individual.  They will not be accessing the workstation in any way, nor will we power off any workstation.  

IT will begin the workstation audit Wednesday, October 17th around 6:00 pm and will continue for up to 4 consecutive nights (and/or this weekend) to ensure that we identify all equipment.   They will perform these audits after hours so as not to interrupt any daily activities. 

Additionally, with the Churn Freeze already in place, it is important to note that once the audits are performed this week, the information gathered is what will be used to plan for the migration of your IT equipment to ECS.  If changes are made to ANY of the workstations (increase in monitors; CPU upgrades, laptop change, etc.), these will not be captured, and we cannot guarantee these changes will be in place with your move to ECS.  


Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.
