The Word of the Day for January 28 is:

aplomb   \uh-PLAHM or uh-PLUM\   (noun)

Did you know?
     Aplomb ultimately comes from the French phrase "a plomb,"
meaning "according to the plummet." A plummet is a lead weight
that is attached to a line and used to determine vertical
alignment. In French, the literal meaning of "aplomb" is
"perpendicularity," and the extended meaning is "composure."
English speakers borrowed "aplomb," in its extended sense, in
the 19th century. The French "plomb" is also the source of the
English word "plumb," meaning "to measure depth" and "to
explore critically and minutely."
