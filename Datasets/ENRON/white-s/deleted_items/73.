*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

You have been chosen to represent your group(s) at this meeting for an overview of the Roles and Responsibilities for Data and Email migration to UBSWE. Infrastructure will need your assistance in getting the "word" out to your teams, and ensuring that everyone complies with the legal and IT requirements. Every user will be required to ownership of their files and emails that meet compliance and need to migrate to our new company

IT will send out a communication to everyone, but I want to give you a "blow by blow" explanation before the communication goes out. If you are unable to attend this meeting, please send someone as your proxy.

Simon -- it would help if you were on hand to assist with any technical questions that may arise, for which I don't have an answer
