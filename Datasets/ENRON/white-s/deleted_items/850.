Tim,

Could you simply log into testp on Friday and just pull up a few of the deal type entry screens and just make sure things look "okay".  They made a change in the Australian database (see below), but they just want to make sure it doesn't affect East.

Thanks.
Casey

A new deal entry screen was added for Australia.  It's just like the Basis Option screen except that  there will be only 1 pub code entered.  I had to go to the Australian database to test the change.  I just want to insure that nothing was affected from your point of view.

Thanks Casey,
Karen

Ladies,
A new version of Deal Entry with a change for Australia has been moved to stage.  I have gotten concurrence from the West (Kate Symes) stating that it is ok.  I need to insure that on our side no changes have been made that impact you.  Will you please test version 3.0.0.210 at your earliest convenience to verify that.

Thank you,
Karen Y. Martin
