Please plan on attending this if you can.

As you can see the group is pretty large.  Sally had limited it to Senior Directors and above.

However, since you run large groups, I think you should be there also.  She agrees.

See you tomorrow.

thanks

bob

Let me know if you can't make it.

I will be at the Hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and I hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well.  Certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today, there will be many questions for Ken, Greg and Mark to address tomorrow.  It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.  

To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.  This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.  It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.  --Sally 

Please let Christina Valdez know today (x39106 or e-mail) if you will be at lunch on Tuesday so that we can place an order.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.
