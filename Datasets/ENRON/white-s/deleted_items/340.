Terry-
 
I have a small revision to make to our Power testing.  We will actually be testing the DPR macros for power because they will be using the application in the Estate world.  Has the specific database been determined that we will need to point the macros to for Estate?  I can have our IT support (Min Zheng) work on it today for me if we have all the information determined.
 
Thanks!
 
Andrea

Subject: Today's Integration Test


Today' s integration test went very well. During testing we identified the following:

additional system dependencies 
additional application steps 
problem areas related to being in a production environment

We accomplished a lot this week and could not have done it without everyone's cooperation and hard work.


 
Thank You!
 
We will update the scripts, schedule and contact list, by end of day, to reflect any changes identified during today's  'Dry Run'. The new versions will be located in \\O:\_Dropbox\IntegrationTestScripts <file://\\O:\_Dropbox\IntegrationTestScripts>
 
Tomorrow we will publish a contact number and tentative schedule for Sunday's Integration Test.
