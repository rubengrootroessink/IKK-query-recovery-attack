The Word of the Day for January 21 is:

aggress  \uh-GRESS\   (verb)
     : to commit aggression : to act aggressively

Example sentence:
     Certain indicators, such as irritability, can indicate an
animal's likelihood to aggress.

Did you know?
     "Aggress" and its more familiar relatives "aggression" and
"aggressive" derive from the Latin verb "aggredi," meaning "to
approach, attack, undertake." When "aggress" was first used in
English in the 16th century, it meant "to approach," but that
use is now obsolete. The current meaning of the word has been
with us since the early 18th century. Back then, the noun
"aggress" ("an attack") appeared occasionally as well, but time
has relegated that use to obsolescence, too.
