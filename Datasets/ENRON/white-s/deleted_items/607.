The Word of the Day for October 25 is:

Valhalla   \val-HAL-uh or vahl-HAHL-uh\   (noun)
      : the great hall in Norse mythology where the souls of
heroes slain in battle are received

Example sentence:
     The great war god Odin, with flowing beard and only one
eye, presided over the meals in Valhalla.

Did you know?
     In Norse mythology, the souls of warriors who died nobly
in battle were brought to a magnificent palace, where they spent
their days fighting for diversion, immune from lasting injury,
and their evenings lustily feasting on freshly killed boar and
quaffing freely-flowing mead. In Old Norse, the word for this
warrior heaven is "Valholl" (literally, "hall of the slain");
in German, it is "Walhalla." English speakers picked up the name
as "Valhalla" in the 18th century. Nowadays, we can use the word
figuratively, and induction or admission into a modern-day
Valhalla doesn't require passing from this life. It can be a
place of honor (a hall of fame, for example) or a place of bliss
(as in "an ice cream lover's Valhalla").
