The Word of the Day for January 30 is:

impromptu   \im-PRAHMP-too or im-PRAHMP-tyoo\   (adjective)
    *1 : made, done, or formed on the spur of the moment
: improvised
     2 : composed or uttered without previous preparation
: extemporaneous

Example sentence:
     When we dropped by unexpectedly, Aunt Louise threw together
an impromptu dinner from the odds and ends in her refrigerator.

Did you know?
     If you think that "impromptu" looks like a relative of
"prompt," you're right; both are ultimately derived from the
Latin "promere," meaning "to bring forth, take out." "Impromptu"
was borrowed from French, where it meant "extemporaneously,"
but French speakers picked it up from the Latin phrase "in
promptu," a "promere" descendant meaning "in readiness" or "at
hand." There is also another, much rarer descendant of "promere"
in English -- the noun "promptuary," meaning "a book of ready
reference."

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
