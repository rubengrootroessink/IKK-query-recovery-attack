The Word of the Day for January 18 is:

constellate   \KAHN-stuh-layt\   (verb)
     transitive senses 1 : to unite in a cluster
     2 : to set or adorn with or as if with constellations
     *intransitive sense : cluster

Example sentence:
     "[Fireflies] constellate and then, for a moment, they all
go dark at once." (_The New York Times_, July 5, 1997)

Did you know?
     It's plain that "constellate" is related to "constellation,"
and indeed, things that "constellate" (or "are constellated")
cluster together like stars in a constellation. Both words
derive ultimately from the Latin word for "star," which is
"stella." "Constellation" (which came to us by way of Middle
French from Late Latin "constellation-, constellatio") entered
the language first -- it dates to at least the 14th century.
"Constellate" appeared on the scene a few centuries later, in
the mid-17th century.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
