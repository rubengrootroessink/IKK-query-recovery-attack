The Word of the Day for October 19 is:

jitney   \JIT-nee\   (noun)
     : a small bus that serves a regular route on a flexible
schedule

Example sentence:
     Guests at the hotel could ride from its parking lot to the
beach in a battered jitney that seated 15 comfortably, but that
held 20 or more on most trips.

Did you know?
     Jitneys weren't worth a dime -- just a nickel. In the early
1900s, "jitney" was slang for "nickel," but it wasn't long before
the term was applied to a new mode of public transportation that
only cost a nickel. When they were introduced in American cities
at the beginning of the century, vehicular jitneys could be any
automobiles that carried passengers over a set route for a cheap
fare, but eventually the term was applied specifically to small
buses that charged a nickel for a ride.
