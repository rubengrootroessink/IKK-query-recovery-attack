Fran,

For the new Tagg book request, please provide the book codes (you can check with Susan Trevino) and the commodity/UOM/Curr (NG/MMBTU/USD?).  Also please confirm whether the same region code (NYMEX) should be used for all books or not.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Cecilia:

I believe John has sent out the associated book requests for west desk on 1/10 or 1/11.  Are west netco books also set up and ready to go as well?

For your convenient reference, I am attaching the west book requests again.
 << File: New Book Request EnPower.xls >>  << File: new BOOK REQUEST TAGG.xls >> 

Please let me know if I can provide anything else.

Thanks,
