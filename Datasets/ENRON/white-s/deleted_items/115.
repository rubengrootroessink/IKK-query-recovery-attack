What do you guys think about this.....assuming we can put a fix in port calc that will allow us to true-up the current day (correctly), we could simply recalc the books the following morning (after last day of month) after indeces have been posted, then adjust the financial numbers in the vlookup according to the new top pages?!

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.
