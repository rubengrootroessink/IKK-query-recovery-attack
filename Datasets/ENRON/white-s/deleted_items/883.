What kind of change?  Was that change not worked into the Spreadsheet Model?

Regards,

Nancy,

The ($3,384,713) difference was due to a change to the Modesto Maranzana power plant.

Martha:

We are in the process of trying to resolve the differences in values reported by the various units on Schedule B as compared to the values our automated process generated.  The EI-ARG-PWR-PRC book had such a difference.   Attached is a file downloaded from RisktRAC with all the dealleg information.  Can you please review these values to you file and reconcile the difference between your report ($1559137) and ours $1825575.80.

Thanks for you help. Please let me know if I can provide you any addition information.


Regards,


Nancy
