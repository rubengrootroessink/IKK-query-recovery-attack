I don't know about this, buttttttt you never know.  The women who wrote the
original email did leave her name and telephone.  I tried to call this
morning just to see who would answer the phone but I have been getting a
fast busy signal--which could be from our weather????  Anyway, I guess
better safe than sorry.
