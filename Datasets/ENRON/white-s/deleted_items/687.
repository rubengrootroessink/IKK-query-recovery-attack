Stacey-

I have a lunch meeting for DHA on Thursday that I committed to be at (and have a report to give).  I definitely do not want to cause problems by not being at this staff meeting that was called for Thursday though.  Would you like me to find someone to take my place at the DHA meeting?

Thanks!

Andrea
