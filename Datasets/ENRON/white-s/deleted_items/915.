Thanks for discussing the FPL structure today.

After talking to several of you, I think it is safe to say that the plant portion of the deal (non-firm) would have to be physical.  However, it does not have to be a separate entity (e.g. plantco).  It is possible that FPL could do the trade in their non-firm book, while the contingent call option part could be done in their derivative book.  This would simplify settling since ENA would only invoice the FPL non-firm book for mwh actually delivered.  

However, the contingent call would be financially settled easily.  If it is exercised, FPL would pay us index less $27.  Since this is not to be modeled or marketed as a swap, there is no fixed for float issue like that discussed this morning.  In other words, Enron has no downside if the plant is down AND mkt prices are below $27, except for the $3 it paid in premium.

I talked to the client and they are noodling on some other structures, so I will wait until I talk to them before I trouble you guys too much more about firming up this structure.

Thanks for your assistance so far.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Regards,

Pete
