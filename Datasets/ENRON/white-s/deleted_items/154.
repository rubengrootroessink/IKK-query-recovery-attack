Which deals/counterparties are they?  The reason I ask is I had gotten comfortable with what was in there.  I'm sure it should fine, since anything done after 1/1/02 we should peforming on. 
Thanks.
Kristin

Kristin, any new deals for Jan 1 forward which were entered under the old trading books have been moved to the West Performance trading book.
