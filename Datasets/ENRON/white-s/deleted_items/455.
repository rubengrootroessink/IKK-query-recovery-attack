Stacey,

The topic at tomorrow's 3:00 pm meeting is "do we have all the correct and required power curves from December 2 forward such that we can correctly MTM our contracts on specific termination dates".  Please bring any and all information that you believe will be relevant, and identify any additional information that we are missing.

Thanks,

Don
