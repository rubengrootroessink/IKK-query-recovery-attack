Sorry-I read part 1 of this question and talked to dgs, but didn't see part 2.  I talked to Anita Luong who said that she doesn't have any information on the Green Mtn deal.  Is there anyone else that I should talk to?

Can you get with Doug and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain?  Also, have you requested from Anita Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C.

Thanks,
Stacey

stacey,

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

PS Also wondering about the green mountain one...

I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.

Thanks,
Stacey

I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Thanks,

Doug
