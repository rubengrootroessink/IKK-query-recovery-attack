Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

Maria,

What information are you trying to obtain through m:\common\power?  Sorry for all the questions, but everyone requesting this directory gets them as this directory contains extremely sensitive information.

Thanks,
Stacey
