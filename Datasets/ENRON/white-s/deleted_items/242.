Wow, it's so weird reading these types of articles and seeing names of
people you knew very closely.  I can just imagine the nightmare that
everyone there is going through.  Has anyone heard how Jennifer, Kate, etc
are doing?  Hopefully, they are hanging in there.

By the way, I have some good news.  I have two offers to stay and work here
in London.  One is from BP and the other one is from a company called Trade
Capture.  The role is very similar at both except one if a well established
old company while the other one is very young.  Advantages to both so just
need to decide which route I want to take.  I will keep you posted.

Miss you guys.

Imelda
