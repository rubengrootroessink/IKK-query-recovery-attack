FYI-

As part of our testing of the new Enpower estate database we have created threee deals in the East portfolio under Kevin Presto's book that will be deleted before we calc this afternoon (hopefully):

#896012-financial swap
#896014-physical index forward
#896015-physical forward

Let me know if there are any issues that arise from us doing this.

Thanks!

Andrea
