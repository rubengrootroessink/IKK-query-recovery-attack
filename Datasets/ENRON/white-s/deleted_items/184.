I think I can make the 12th, but can't promise I'll have the book read.  But it sounds short.

Kelly had Luke, we no longer havea excuse not to see eachother.  O.K. Kelly,
we might make a small exception for you.  I think we should start off with a
small novella, written by Steve Martin.  Yes, Steve Martin, the comedian.
He has a short book in the stores; he has written.  It is called Shopgirl.
The reviews in Amazon are fairly good.  Does anyone else have a good
suggestion?  I think meeting in the beginning of February would be a good
idea. -Christina
P.S. We miised you, Kelly and Anna at my fine party(oh yeah it was for Kelly
Kampe too!).  Ya'll will just have to hear all about it.
