The Word of the Day for February 5 is:

affluent   \AF-loo-unt\   (adjective)
     1 : flowing in abundance
    *2 : having a generously sufficient and typically
increasing supply of material possessions

Example sentence:
     The affluent families of Tropic City head for their
mountain getaways on sultry summer weekends; the less well-
heeled seek respite in the river that flows through town.

Did you know?
     Are you overflowing with possessions? Does the money
flow in? Are your assets fluid? If so, you can consider
yourself "affluent." Today's word is really all about "flow"
-- that is to say, it's based on the Latin word for "flow,"
which is "fluere." (Some other "fluere" descendants are
"confluence," "fluctuate," "fluid," "influence," "mellifluous,"
and "superfluous.") The older use of "affluent" refers, both
literally and figuratively, to an abundant flow, as in "an
affluent fountain" or "affluent joy." In fact, it was probably
the tendency to use "affluent fortune" for an abundant flow of
money that led to our using "affluent" as a synonym of "well-
to-do."

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
