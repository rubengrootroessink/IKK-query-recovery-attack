Do you know anything about a Hanson deal that Edith has been involved with in EES? Evidently she did a test calc on it in Enpower and it took 12 hours, so they are now trying it through sequel server. What is the proper procedure for setting this up outside of Enpower, notifying all appropriate groups that would be affected, how do we set up, etc.
