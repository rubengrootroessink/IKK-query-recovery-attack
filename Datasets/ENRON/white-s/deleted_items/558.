Michael,

Can you please clear out the values from the last contingent call spreadsheet (PP-SSR3B) you uploaded, upload it once again into RiskTrac, and then make it inactive....(just like you did for PP-SSR3C)?!  It expired at the end of August, so we stopped uploading it, of course, but RiskTrac still has that last day's position in it.

Thanks!
Casey
