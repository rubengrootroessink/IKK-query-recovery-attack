The Word of the Day for January 20 is:

blithesome   \BLYTHE-sum\   (adjective)
     : gay, merry

Example sentence:
     The celebration was a blithesome scene: men and women
dancing to the lively tunes of an impromptu band, children
running and playing, the air filled with joyous shouts and
laughter.

Did you know?
     "Blithesome" comes from "blithe," a word that has been a
part of English since before the 12th century. "Blithe" can mean
"casual" and "heedless" as well as "joyful" and "lighthearted,"
but "blithesome" obviously makes use of only the "joyful,
lighthearted" sense. "Blithesome" didn't show up in print in
English until 1724, and is now relatively uncommon, but you'll
find it in the works of such authors as Charles Dickens, Sir
Walter Scott, Mark Twain, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
