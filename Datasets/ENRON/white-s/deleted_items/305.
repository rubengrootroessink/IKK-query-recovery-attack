Kathy,

Does this mean that the 3 gas trades between East Power and Alberta can be terminated, as well?!

Thanks,
Casey

Whenever we asked to give terminated information for the Estate we should include the 'Alberta ENA Bankruptcy' portfolio.  The transactions in this portfolio are transactions entered into by Canada using a ENA contract that has now been terminated.

If you have specific questions, please contact Kathy Reeves.
