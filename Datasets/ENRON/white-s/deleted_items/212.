Due to urgent estate requests from the Credit Committee, we need to maintain the 11-30 data that is currently in our AdHoc tables.  As a result, we will not be calc'ing for 1/16 tomorrow morning as originally planned.  As a result, please use the post id's from 1/15 for the 1/16 data.  The post ids are as follows:

15998 (East)
15999 (East Bankruptcy)
16007 (West)
16006 (West Bankruptcy)

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Casey
