Stacey - Bring your transponder back to the parking and transpotation office, located on the third (3) floor - ECN 305. Once we have your transponder, we will activate your EZ tag.

Martin,

I have both a toll tag and a parking transponder.  My toll tag # is 00136756.  Please let me know what else I need to do.

Thanks,
Stacey White
