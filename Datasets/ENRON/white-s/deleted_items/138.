The Word of the Day for January 26 is:

cognizable   \KAHG-nuh-zuh-bul or kahg-NYE-zuh-bul\   (adjective)
     1 : capable of being known
    *2 : capable of being judicially heard and determined

Example sentence:
     The court determined that the plaintiff's claim of having
received an unfair grade was not a legally cognizable action.

Did you know?
     It's easy to recognize the "cogni-" in "cognizable" as the
root in other English words that have to do with knowing:
"precognition," "incognito," "recognition," and "cognitive,"
for example. They're all from Latin "cognoscere" ("to know").
"Cognizable" was formed in the 17th century from the root of
"cognizance," which means "knowledge." "Cognizance" in turn
traces to "cognoscere" by way of Middle French "conoissance."
"Cognizable" was used in the legal sense almost from its
introduction, and that's the sense that is far and away the
most common use today.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
