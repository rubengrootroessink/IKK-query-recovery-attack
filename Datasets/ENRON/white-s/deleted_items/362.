Sterphanie -- Following your having brought me the termination letters for the above-referenced wholesale power counterparties, I confirm the following:

Montana Power's 12-21-99 master should be consiedered terminated as of the dates of stated in their termination letter, Jan. 8, 2002

The Energy Company's attempt to terminate the 9-17-97 master effective Nov 29, 2001 was ineffective, because the master had a five day advance notice provision, but the master's automatic termination provision operates to have terminated it Dec. 2, 2001.

Please contact me with any questions.  David
