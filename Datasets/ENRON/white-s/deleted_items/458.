     1 a : easily accomplished, handled, or attained

     3 : ready, fluent

     The book is well-organized, but the conclusions and

Did you know?
     Would you have guessed that "facile" and "difficult" are
related? They are! "Facile" comes to us through Middle French,
from the Latin word "facilis," meaning "easy," and ultimately
from "facere," meaning "to make or do." "Difficult" traces to
"facilis" as well, but its history also involves the negative
prefix "dis-," meaning "not." "Facile" can mean "easy" or
"easily done," as befits its Latin roots, but it now often adds
the connotation of undue haste, shallowness, or oversimplifi-
cation, as in "facile answers to complex questions."

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.
