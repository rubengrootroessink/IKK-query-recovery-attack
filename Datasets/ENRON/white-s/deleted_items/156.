 << File: NETCO 1-3-02.ppt >> 
This org. chart head count totals 135, with an additional 34 that should be included from Peggy Hedstrom's org. chart sent from the Canada office which totals 169 for NETCO Energy Operations.

If you have any questions please contact Leslie Reeves @ X37962.

Thank you,
Leslie Reeves
