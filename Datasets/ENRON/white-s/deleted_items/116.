I believe so.  Basically, the true-up flag will need to be set from previous day through current day and the current day (e.g. 1/31 for the 1/31 vs. 1/30 calc) will need to be true-up.  Currently, even if we set the true-up parameters to true-up through the current day, port calc still will not true it up.  However, with the high volume of financial transactions the traders will be doing, we will have to find a way to true up the last day before we close the books for the month.

Dear Casey,

	Is this the same question we had before on Option True Up? Let me give you a call in the morning.

	Regards,


Norman.

wonderful point!!!  

Norman, looks like your next task has just arrived!!!  Let me know if you have questions regarding this, but we do need to be able to true up through the current day of calc when necessary.

Thanks.
Casey

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.
