Subject:	information for the creditors committee

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.
