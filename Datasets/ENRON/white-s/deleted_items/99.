Thanks for the reminder.  Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids.  (Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's.)

I am not sure if I said or not that I would be out Tues. Jess has a series of doctor appointments (due to family history) tomorrow so I will be babysitting. Don't think I will be missing anything with it being so slow.
