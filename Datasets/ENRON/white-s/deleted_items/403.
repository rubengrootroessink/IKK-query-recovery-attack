It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John
