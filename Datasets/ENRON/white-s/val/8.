Hi Min Zheng and Norman:

In the past couple of weeks you have been working on adding three new books 
(Short-term west rockies, Short-term west services, and Long-term west 
options) for the west.  Yesterday we entered/moved our exotic deal (deal # 
13982.3, which was originally in Short-term Southwest book) into the new 
Short-term west rockies book and we are seeing a couple of problems:

(1) It seems that in DprAutomation the Short-term west rockies book was named 
as "ST-WROCK", rather than "ST-WR" (i.e. the book's/roll's name in 
M:\common\power\Postion\Dpr\2001\0102).  Therefore, last night and this 
morning we had to temparily changed the roll's name to ST-WROCK in order to 
allow DprAutomation to run through the roll to bring in P&L/PCS/PID data.  
(After DprAutomation was done running, we then changed it back to ST-WR so we 
can link the roll to the "pwrdpr" file).  

=> We need DprAutomation to use "ST-WR" for Short-term west rockies book so 
we won't have to change the file name everytime we run DprAutomation.

(2) As mentioned earlier, yeterday deal #13982.3 's desk was changed from 
ST-SW to Short-term west rockies in the Exotic book.  Although we officialize 
the Exotic book (post id 14061), Nancy Hernandez in Risk Management (Houston) 
found that they could not see the Short-term west rockies book officialized 
in Exotic.  

=> I am not sure if this is due to the same problem as in (1) or something 
else.  We need the new Short-term west rockies book set up right so it can be 
officialized in the Exotic book in order for the Risk Control Group in 
Houston to see/monitor it.

Please help us look at the above issues.  Let me know if I can provide more 
useful information.

(For Nancy:  I spoke with Valarie and there is nothing we know of other than 
deal #13982.3 that was in the ST-SW book in Exotic book.  Since we moved the 
deal to Short-term west rockies book last night, it should be normal to see 
nothing remaining in the ST-SW book.)

Thanks,
Fran

Hi guys:  

I just wanted to touch base with you on how we are doing on the IT side 
regarding the 3 new books that West Power is establishing (* please refer to 
the email attached from Val sent on 2/5/2001).  

Today, we will be creating the three new desks/books (ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options).  Would you please help us set up these 
three new desks/books in "West tot belden2".  The path to the file is 
M:\power2\Curve\New_sys\Data.  Specifically, when you open the file and go to 
"Peak", "Off-Peak", "Peak-By Region", and "Off-Peak-By Region" tabs, you will 
see pivot tables/columns which can be manupulated to get positions in our 
existing desks/books (eg. LT-NW, LT-SW, etc).  We need ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options to be included in these tabs under seperate 
columns, too.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Hello all.   I'm not sure if I've included too few people or too many, but 
you can let me know if I've left someone off the list or have included 
someone unnecessarily.  

We're busy up here in Portland adding new desks...these new desks  will need 
to mapped through all of the Enpower reports/calcs, DPR, adhoc, MTM97, etc.

There are several of you that I will need to work with after the books are 
set up, but I think this gets us through the initial push.  Attached is the 
primary information on the new books.  Please email me or call if there are 
any questions.

I'd like to have the setup completed by Wednesday, Feb. 07, if possible.

Thanks!
