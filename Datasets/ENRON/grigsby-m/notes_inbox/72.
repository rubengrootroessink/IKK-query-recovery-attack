		Dear Mike,
		
		Today in Washington, D.C., the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee 
voted against a proposal to force the FERC to impose price caps in the West.  
D.C. bureau correspondent Peter Cook says tomorrow the bureau is following up 
on the fallout from today's failed effort by Democrats to force the price 
caps issue.  Peter also says tomorrow they'll bring us the latest leaks from 
next week's scheduled White House Energy Task Force recommendations.    
		
		From the Houston bureau tomorrow, ENL's Gale Smith says AES New Energy's 
Corby Whitaker is scheduled to be in studio.  He'll update us on how AES is 
doing so far in the Texas electricity deregulation pilot program.  Gale says 
Whitaker will also give us details as to how many retail businesses have 
signed up, and what the future holds for AES New Energy.  Houston 
correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to give us an update on crude 
storage in the Gulf of Mexico.  Kim says the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal 
Minerals Management Services are close to approving rules allowing ships to 
store crude while anchored in the Gulf.  We'll bring you all the details on 
these and other stories from Houston tomorrow.        
		
		As promised, I have information on ENL's trip to Alaska.  The Houston 
bureau's Gale Smith is frantically digging out warmer clothes as she prepares 
to go to Anchorage Monday and Tuesday to cover the Interstate Oil and Gas 
Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  The IOGCC represents 37 governors from 
states that produce most of the domestic oil and natural gas in the U.S.  
Gale says the agenda for the Midyear Meeting includes oil and gas production 
in Alaska, the National Energy Policy, petroleum production and environmental 
issues.  Some guest speakers include Alaska Governor and IOGCC Chairman Tony 
Knowles, former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, and Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation 
Commission representatives from Phillips Alaska, OMEGA Oil Company, and BP 
Amoco. 
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.
