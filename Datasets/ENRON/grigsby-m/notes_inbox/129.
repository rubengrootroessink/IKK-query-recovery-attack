		Dear Mike,
		
		Two large mergers are done deals.  Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in  
debt today.  The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum 
products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed  
a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.  The deal more  
than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a  
producer and distributor of natural gas.  Today ENL brought you interviews  
with the CEOs from all four companies.  If you happened to miss it, log onto 
the ENL website and click on "video library" to see the interviews in full.  
		
		ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early  
tomorrow.  Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov.  
Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.  The agenda of the meeting will include  
discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California.  
Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford.  
		
		Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.  Kim 
Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other  
companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.  Be sure  
to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.  Later in the week, Kim will  
take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua  
Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.  Kim says  
TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar  
panels for use all over the world.  Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light  
on the solar panel issue.  
		
		Coming up tomorrow, Cook Inlet's Gregory Craig is scheduled to join us  from 
our Houston bureau.  Craig will be in to discuss Cook Inlet's joint  venture 
with Mirant.  We'll bring you all the details in the 10:00 a.m. EST  
broadcast.  
		
		This is a dynamic industry and things are subject to change at a moment's 
notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to 
do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
