Mike,

I am not sure what role you might have played on the below Sitara deals since 
they are EOL deals so bare with me.

It looks as though all of Calpine's physical gas deals have been moved over 
to Calpine Energy Services (CES).  In other words, they have billed all gas 
under the CES entity for Apr-01 production.  However, it looks as though 
these deals were booked in EOL.  If that is the case, can you confirm that a 
Clapine trader actually entered these deals?  If so, do you know who that 
trader is?  If not, what can be done to change the counterparty name on these 
deals to Calpine Energy Services?  Any help would be appreciated.
