		Dear Mike,
		
		Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford is back in Washington, D.C. today.  He 
says next week will be a whirlwind with the unveiling of the White House 
Energy Task Force's National Energy Policy recommendations. President Bush 
will be in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday announcing the recommendations, 
and D.C. bureau's Peter Cook is getting ready to cover the event.  Peter will 
bring us reports next week. 
		
		Also from Washington, D.C. next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee is holding a much-anticipated confirmation hearing for the two 
newest FERC nominees.  If the committee clears Pat Wood and Nora Mead 
Brownell, the full Senate could consider the nominations soon after.  We'll 
have more information on the hearing next week.   
		
		Houston bureau's Kim Benestante tells us the Panda Corporation is bringing a  
1,000-megawatt power plant online in June in Odessa, TX.  The new plant will 
accompany their Guadalupe County plant near San Antonio that's already 
online.  Kim says she'll also bring us details on a Los Angeles investor that 
is buying majority interest in Plains Pipeline.  Log on all next week for 
stories from ENL's Houston bureau.    
		
		Also next week, Houston bureau's Gale Smith is in Anchorage, Alaska covering 
the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  We'll bring 
you reports from Gale in Alaska next week. 
		
		We have plenty more energy news coming up on ENL.  On Monday from our D.C. 
bureau, Editor of Downstream Energy Group Carol Cole is scheduled to join 
us.  She'll be live in D.C. to discuss the fallout from the Valero-Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock merger.  You can catch Cole's comments in the 4:00 p.m. ET 
broadcast.  
		
		In the 9:00 a.m. ET broadcast on Wednesday, President and COO of Unit 
Corporation John Nikkel is scheduled to be in studio to discuss drilling.  
Log on all week to catch these and other interviews.   
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.   
		
		Keep it on energynewslive.com for all your energy news. 
		Have a great weekend! 	?
