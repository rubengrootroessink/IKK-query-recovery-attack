ENERGY COMMISSION SCHEDULES HEARING, TOUR OF PROPOSED POWER PLANT SITE IN 
CHINO

Sacramento -- The California Energy Commission has scheduled a hearing and 
site tour for members of the public and other parties interested in learning 
about a 180-megawatt summer reliability generation facility proposed for 
construction this summer on the grounds of the California Institution for Men 
in Chino.

The Pegasus Project in San Bernardino County is being proposed by Pegasus 
Power Partners, LLC, part of Delta Power Company LLC. The simple cycle 
peaking facility would consist of four 45-megawatt natural gas-fired turbines 
equipped with state-of-the-art air pollution control features. Three of the 
four units would be producing power by September 30, 2001, with the fourth 
unit coming on-line by March 31, 2002. All four units are being considered 
under the Energy Commission's emergency process, which should take 
approximately 21 days to complete.

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Wednesday, 
May 16, 2001.

Site Visit
Assemble at 5:30 p.m.
Chino City Hall

(Wheelchair Accessible)

Landowners, members of the general public and interested agencies are 
encouraged to participate in the site visit and the informational hearing on 
the licensing of the proposed Pegasus project.

Since this site visit will be conducted inside the California Institute for 
Men, waivers and special restrictions on dress may be required of those 
taking the tour. Please consult the Energy Commission's Public Advisor, 
Roberta Mendonca, no later than May 14, 2001, for details before signing up. 
Her office can be contacted by e-mail at . Her office can also assist 
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on 
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. For information 
about proposed projects in Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Typically, peakers are simple-cycle power plants that can be constructed in a 
relatively small area and can be readily connected to existing transmission 
and natural-gas systems. For the Pegasus Project, these systems already exist 
nearby because of a 27-megawatt cogeneration power plant that operates at the 
California Institution for Men.

The Pegasus Project applied to the Energy Commission's emergency siting 
process to meet this summer'selectricity needs. The goal of the emergency 
process is to license power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, 
without sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist interested 
individuals and organizations and provide information on participating in the 
Commission's emergency siting process. Persons may contact Ms. Mendonca by 
e-mail at . For information regarding proposed projects in Northern 
California, call (877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in 
Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Commission's Web Site at:
