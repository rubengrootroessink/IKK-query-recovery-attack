Ina:

Reuters has not permissioned the Inside Ferc this is how you can get to the 
page once it is permissioned.  I have called them several times to have it 
turned on and they assure me that they are working on it.  


The following is how to launch Inside F.E.R.C'S Natural Gas Alert:

1.  Launch Telerate 
2.  Click on Pages application  
3.  click on Data 
4.  click on Sources 
5.  verify RSFPages has a check by it, if it doesn't click on it.
6.  type PGNINDEX this will bring you to the Inside FERC Natural Gas Alert 
Speed Guide
