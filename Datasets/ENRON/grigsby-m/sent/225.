Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another 
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in 
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and 
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in 
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a 
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets 
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas Trading
