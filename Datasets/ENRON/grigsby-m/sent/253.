Paige & Mark,

I went to Mike Grigsby's house to setup the DSL and Nortel connection but was 
unsuccessful.  When I tried to log in to CORP I got an error that no domain 
server was able to validate my password.  I went in and released the IP but 
got an error when trying to renew.  I verified that the card was installed 
correctly and that network properties were correct.  I then plugged straight 
into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that 
to work and then VPN into Enron.  That also did not work.  I spoke to SWB 
tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was 
unsuccessful in those as well.  I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.

I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me 
to believe that there was something wrong with the line.  SWB said they were 
going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.  
At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team 
that is more familiar with these setups than I am.  I do think it would be a 
good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange 
a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.  

Regards,
KG
