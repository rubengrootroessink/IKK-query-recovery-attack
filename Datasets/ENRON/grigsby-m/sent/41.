Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions 
to IM denver.  I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and 
buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.  Also, run a report of all my term 
index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these 
to Jay as well.

Thanks,
Mike
