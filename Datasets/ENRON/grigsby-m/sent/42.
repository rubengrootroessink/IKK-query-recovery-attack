The Rockies index language looks good.  We need to separate the southern 
border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.  All 
Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and 
southern border - socal wacogs, while the PG&E topock/southern border - PG&E 
trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.  Please make the change to 
the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.

Thanks,
Mike
