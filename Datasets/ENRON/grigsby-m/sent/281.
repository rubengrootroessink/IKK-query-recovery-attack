I think the Proxim solution is the way to go.  Compaq has partnered with
these guys.

You need: an ISA card for your desktop and a PC card for your notebook


Here is the link that gives an overview of the product:

Here is the best deal I found where they were in stock.  I believe you need
the last two items listed on the page.
