Site is on temporary string lighting, Aux Boiler, with Diesels running.
Investigation into trubine bearing damage and possible Unit Auxiliary
Transformer problems.

V.P. Russ Krieger came over the PA to say "Yahoo San Onofre!" for a job
well done in getting the outage done in 32 days (breaker to breaker, so to
speak). He went on to say that it is not known if the fault was related to
outage work, or if there will be an effect on our outage bonus. He said
we'll be of line for several weeks. I'd say at least that since our turbine
ground to a halt with no DC lube oil, and is still cooling with no jacking.
