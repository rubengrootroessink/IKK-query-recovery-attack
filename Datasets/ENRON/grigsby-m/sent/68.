Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen 
outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days 
gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from 
the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on 
Thursday.

Thanks,
Mike
