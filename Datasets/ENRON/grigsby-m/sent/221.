Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this 
product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus 
nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled 
out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going 
forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, 
as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be 
out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.  

We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to 
market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be 
considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to 
participate until their numbers are audited.

Thanks,
Mike
