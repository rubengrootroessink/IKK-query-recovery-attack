That was the main factor.  The cash market also had a difficult time trading 
higher than 14.50.  The basis curve was on its way to contango, when it has 
lived in backwardation for some time.  This created resistance on the basis 
curve.  The PG&E announcement pushed it over the edge.  Market is back up 
today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement.
