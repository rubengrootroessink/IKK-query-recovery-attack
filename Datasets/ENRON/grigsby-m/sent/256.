Directions to my house.


We will see between 5:15 and 5:30 Monday.

West of the Galleria, take San Felipe down to Fountainview and take a left.  
You will pass the Rice Epicurean store on your right.  Go straight to the 
first light, take a right on Burgoyne.  You will pass through Potomac and 
Nantucket, continue into Briar Grove neighborhood.  When you come to the stop 
sign, take a right on Briar Ridge.  My house is on the southwest corner of 
the next intersection, Meadow Lake and Briar Ridge.  My ophone number is 
713-780-1022.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
