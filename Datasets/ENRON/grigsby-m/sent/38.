We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.
