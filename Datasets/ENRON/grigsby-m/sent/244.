Mike --

I have asked David Wile to research and get back with you on the issues 
you've documented below.  Any time you are having an issue in the evenings, 
the quickest method of response is to call 34888, and choose option 5. Leave 
a vmail and a technician will respond within 20 mintues

Thanks
Paige

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
Network Neighborhood?

Thanks,
Mike
