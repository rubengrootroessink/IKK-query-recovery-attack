Bruce, 

I work with Phillip Allen in West Gas Trading and he talked to Greg Piper 
about the letter attached below, and Greg told us to forward it to you.    
Mr. Chase Belew and Mr. Carleson, with E*Steel, would like to meet with you 
to discuss market opportunities in the global steel market.   I would like to 
have Mr. Belew call you to set up a time to meet with you.  Would this be a 
problem?  Please call me to discuss.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,


Chase Belew
