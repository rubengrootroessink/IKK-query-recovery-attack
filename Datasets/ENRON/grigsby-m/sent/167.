Hello JJ.  The Clark family will have me traveling to Abilene on this day.  I 
hate to miss the highlight of the X-MAS holiday.  Let me know what the plans 
are for New Year's Eve this year.  Will you guys be in Houston?  I hope 
Dallas is treating you well.  We can't wait to see Michael.  Clark and Jake 
are doing great.
