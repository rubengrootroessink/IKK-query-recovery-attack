I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with 
restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West 
physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two 
months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am 
managing all physical positions.
