Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in 
sitara?  I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San 
Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in 
April).  The Baja transport is through March 2002.  80000/d to Citygate and 
20,000 to KRS off-system.

This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.  
Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.

Thanks,
Mike
