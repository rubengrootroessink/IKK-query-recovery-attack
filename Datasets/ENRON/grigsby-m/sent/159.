The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.  

Thanks,
Mike
