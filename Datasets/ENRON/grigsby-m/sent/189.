Hello.  The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers 
regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.  
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid 
physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and 
greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now 
accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.  This will allow us to 
trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.

Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?  
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.  We would 
like it to be very upbeat and funny.  

Thank you for your assistance.  I can be reached at x37031.


Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas trading

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

Kal
