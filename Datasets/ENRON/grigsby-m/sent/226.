Greg,

I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of 
mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with 
Enron.  If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to 
possibly set up a meeting.

I work on the west gas trading desk.  You can reach me at x37031.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,


Chase Belew
