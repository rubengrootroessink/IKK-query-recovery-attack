Frank,

The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get 
the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am 
pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis 
market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal 
through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the 
future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the 
same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know 
in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.

Thanks,
Mike
