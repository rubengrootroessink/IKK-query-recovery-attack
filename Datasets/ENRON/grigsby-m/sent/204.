Dear Tom,

I am glad you like the website.  When you go into the personalize myquotes 
filter, select the commodity, region, and products.  You will need to scroll 
down the products list and select the US GAS phys index points of interest to 
you.  Please call me if you have any problems.  Your filter can then be 
sorted by right clicking on the filter at the column heading.  You can sort 
by five different groupings.  

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
