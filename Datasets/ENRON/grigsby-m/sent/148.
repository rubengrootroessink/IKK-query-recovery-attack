I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.  Please 
refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these 
indices.  We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we 
currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the 
database.  I would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following 
points.  El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal 
Gas, large packages.  We will need to add electronic to the product title to 
differentiate between the two gd swaps.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby
