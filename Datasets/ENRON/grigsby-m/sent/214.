Thanks for the update.  Try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow.  Our 
length is good for now.  Let's stay flat for now in the oct index. I will be 
working from home in the morning.  Please have Matt email the ops reports to 
my lotus.  Also, please have Patti email her sheets also - the pipeline 
summary and flow reports.

Download the hearme.com software and login on my pc to use the mic, or the 
headset in one of the drawers on the right.  Tell Philip that I will be using 
hearme.com.

Mike
