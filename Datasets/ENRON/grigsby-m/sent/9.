Good morning.  I am going to unavailable for the interviews on Monday.  The 
continued Califonia energy crisis and Enron's gas positions will not allow me 
to leave the desk on Monday.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but my time 
must be spent in the office.  Please let me know how I may be able to assist 
the interview process in the future.  I am always willing to help out when I 
have the time.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
