We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Mike
