<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

The Dollar stood strong and Equities were boosted by a positive
consumer sentiment survey as trading slowed down ahead of the
Christmas holiday.  A late flurry in Cattle, Hogs and Bellies
featured commodity markets, with Cattle pushing to a two-week 
high.  Silver continued to shine as lease rates stayed firm, 
and Gold followed in symnpathy with the Argentina situation a
background factor.  Another rally attempt by Coffee on Thursday
was dashed, Cocoa ended quietly mixed, while Cotton ended with
small gains but a soft undertone.  Book squaring jimmied Energies.
Soybeans were flat, Wheat mixed and Corn down on export
uncertainties.
