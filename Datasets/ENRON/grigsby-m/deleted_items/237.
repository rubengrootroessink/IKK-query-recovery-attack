<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sorry to bother you, I know you are extremely busy, but I was emailing to ask you a few quick questions and get a bit of advice.&nbsp; I have seen in the news that Enron plans to sell at least a 51% stake in the trading operations in the January 10th auction, and I wasn't sure if you knew what that might mean for me.&nbsp; As you know, the market is quite flooded with ex-Enron employees and finding an entry-level job in the&nbsp;energy industry isn't a very easy task.&nbsp; I have sent my resume to many firms, with little luck besides a possible real-time position with Duke Energy.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I was just checking with you to see if there is any chance that I may have a job come&nbsp;January with your desk, or if&nbsp;my odds would be better with another&nbsp;company.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not know the answer to some of my questions, and I understand completely why you wouldn't quite know.&nbsp; Thanks so much for your help and advice,&nbsp; Scott Freeman</DIV>
