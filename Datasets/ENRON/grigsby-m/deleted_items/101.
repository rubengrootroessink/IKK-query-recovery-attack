Subject: Wedding Date



Leah and I have settled on April 13th as the wedding date and San Miguel
de
Allende, Mexico as the place. We will be sending out a "Save the Date"
notice and a website link with more information including the schedule,
travel options, accommodations and stuff to do in SM. I just wanted to
give
everyone a heads up. We look forward to seeing all of you there.
