Endorsement of the Kingwood Observer:

MAYOR - Chris Bell

The mayoral race has been a tough one to call. We have wrestled with this
difficult decision. During interviews and forums, how do we really know who
will be the best leader? The three who came to meet with us would probably
all make a good mayor. For the most part, they agree on the problems which
make up the challenges of the future: air pollution, ground to surface water
conversion, potholes, traffic, equal division of tax dollars, mass transit,
emergency services. They all care about the city.

But how to choose, without the influence of political affiliation? Past
behavior and character. On that basis, Chris Bell is the best candidate.

The Observer has endorsed Bell before, when he was running for council. He
is probably the most intelligent of the three major contenders. He has a
quick wit and readily quips that he has held the three least regarded
professions : journalist, lawyer and politician.

Most importantly, he does not make promises he cannot or will not keep. He
has never lied to the Kingwood voter. He did not vote for annexation - he
was not on council during that acrimonious time.

He supports a tax rebate at the end of the fiscal year, he has a
well-thought out traffic management plan and a three-point plan for
improving the Houston Fire Department resources. He supports a vote on any
expansion to Metro's light rail system, although he wisely does not support
stopping the seven-mile project that is already begun. His focus is the
taxpayer as the customer, and the customer drives the services.

He sees the big picture and has the intelligence to lead wisely. He is not
favored by either political party, a good thing in our opinion, and points
out that in this time of national crisis, leaders who can bring diverse
needs and people together will be the best leader.

Bell's major opponent did vote for annexation. He misled Kingwood citizens,
for nearly 18 months, by saying he had not decided on his annexation vote.
In his Observer interview, he admitted that he traded his yes vote on
annexation to then-mayor Bob Lanier in exchange for his "promise" to provide
equal services before he was ever elected!

This is fishy reasoning. First, equal services are guaranteed by state law,
not by mayoral promises. Second, the promise was more likely support for his
council bid.

He sold us out before we ever knew his name and then mislead us again and
again. Dishonesty is a character flaw, not a behavior.

Elect Chris Bell mayor. He is the breath of fresh air City Hall needs.
