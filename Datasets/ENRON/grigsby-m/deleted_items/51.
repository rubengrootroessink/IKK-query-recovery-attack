Latest NFL Player News 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1082&>, RB CAR - Tomaski Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1186&>, WR NE - McKay Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, WR DET - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1028&>, QB GB - The Rocks Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1151&>, RB SEA - McKay Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Grigsby Player News 

Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.

Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Marshall Faulk  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01 
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Tiki Barber  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Peyton Manning  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/18/01 
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Peerless Price  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Charlie Garner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01 
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Jaguars  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01 
Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. 

Chargers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01 
Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. 

Carl Pickens  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01 
Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. 

Troy Aikman  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01 
Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. 

Brett Conway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00 
Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.
