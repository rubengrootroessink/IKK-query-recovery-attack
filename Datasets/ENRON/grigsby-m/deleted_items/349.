I agree with everything in your summary except for of course the ridiculous=
 parenthesis part in #2. But, as for rooting on the horns come Friday I can=
not go along. From birth I have been conditioned to hate the Texas Longhorn=
s. When I moved to the state of Texas at the age of 4 this emotion became s=
o firmly ingrained in every fiber of my being that it is impossible for me =
to ever root for the horns. I can think of no circumstance in which I would=
 ever root, cheer, or applaud the Texas Longhorns in any sporting event. I =
was even rooting for those faggy Europeans to beat Longhorn Lance Armstrong=
 in that bicycle thingy-majig last year in France. So, yes, Friday morning =
I will be rooting that the horns embarrass themselves on national TV, that =
Chrissy is the laughing stock of the nation, and that the fake military and=
 their brainwashed fans party the night away in that one horse town of Coll=
ege Station. If that happens my left-over turkey will taste that much bette=
r and if not the Sooners gain valuable bonus points. Either way, I win.
