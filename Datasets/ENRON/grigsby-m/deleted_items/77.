How is the last revision that you sent me of the position report different than the version you revised earlier yesterday?

Attached are the reports for today.  I neglected to realize that I hadn't yet created formulas for the change columns, so today they aren't working.  By tomorrow, they will be.

I have hard copies printed out if you want them; I'll bring them down in a second.
