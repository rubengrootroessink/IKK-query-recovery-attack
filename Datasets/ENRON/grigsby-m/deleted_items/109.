 	  	 Dear Mike,

It's been one year since ENL began broadcasting - log on Tuesday and join the Energy News Live celebration. We've scheduled a full day of coverage and special guests to commemorate our anniversary. 

At the top of the list is our continuing live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us an interview with European Union Energy Commissioner Loyola De Palacio. Join us on Tuesday as De Palacio discusses the reliability of energy supplies for Europe. 

The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax situation and how it's impacting Congress. At noon ET Tuesday, the bureau is expected to talk with Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman about the chance the Senate will consider energy legislation before Congress adjourns for the year. 

Also from the Washington bureau on Tuesday, Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King will give us his thoughts on where energy legislation stands in Congress. King will drop by during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. 

Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker will also speak with us from Washington on Tuesday. Hoecker will discuss the newest FERC nominee, Joe Kelliher, and what the Commission accomplished with its recently concluded RTO week during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

The Houston bureau also has some great guests scheduled on Tuesday. Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey will join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast. He'll discuss the crisis in risk management over the last year. 

We'll also hear from Merrill Lynch Lead Energy Analyst Donato Eassey. He'll drop by the Houston bureau to discuss the difficulties of this year, and where the energy industry goes from here. Eassey is penciled in during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more on the California Department of Water Resources from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday. The CDWR is holding a workshop in Sacramento to explain new revenue requirements and how the factors involved will bring down costs. 

Kym says we'll also have more from former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and his thoughts on deregulation. We'll have details from these stories and more on Tuesday from the West Coast bureau. 

From Columbus, Ohio, AEP Spokesperson Pat Hemlepp will discuss AEP's earnings report due out Tuesday. Hemlepp will also bring us an update on changes at AEP's payment processing center in the wake of the anthrax scares, and the importance of electronic payments, during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
