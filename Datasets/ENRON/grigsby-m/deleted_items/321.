      <p>Dear Mike,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to "Mike Grigsby" <Mike.Grigsby@enron.com>, who belongs to
list enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>The <b>Department of Energy</b> is hosting a <b>conference on Clean
Coal Technology</b> on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a
look at where <b>coal-fired generation could be headed in the
future</b>.  <b>U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick</b>, the
Chairman and CEO of <b>Pepco</b>, is among those scheduled to speak.
<p>Look for <b>energy legislation to move to the forefront when
lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break</b>.  Republicans in the Senate
say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while
Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington
bureau will bring us an <b>update on where legislation</b> stands and
what the chances are that we'll see a <b>comprehensive energy bill</b>
before the end of the year.
<p>The <b>North American Electric Reliability Council</b> will release
its <b>2001/2002 Winter Assessment</b> on Tuesday; our Washington bureau
will bring us coverage.
<p>If <b>MTBE</b> is banned, the <b>gasoline industry</b> will have to
drastically <b>increase production of ethanol</b>.  On Monday, the
Houston bureau's <br>Gale Smith will have a report on some companies
looking at <b>alternative ways of making ethanol</b>.  We'll find out
which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.
<p>A recent poll taken by <b>Deloitte & Touche</b> says <b>power
deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for
consumers</b>.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte &
Touche's <b>Branko Terzic</b> on Monday.
<p>ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the <b>California Power Authority is
meeting</b> over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its
<b>Energy Resource Investment Plan</b>.  The plan is due to the
legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us
the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.
<p>Also on Monday, the <b>California Energy Commission</b> will hear a
<b>petition</b> for reconsideration of its decision on <b>Calpine's
proposed Metcalf Energy Center</b>.  After the meeting we'll have
comments from the <b>counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker</b>. 
<p><b>Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker</b> will speak
with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a <b>status check
of energy legislation</b> and discuss what he feels is the real
<b>problem behind Enron</b>.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the
2:00 p.m. ET newscast.
<p>From Dallas on Monday, <b>RBC Capital Markets Director <br>Mark
Easterbrook</b> is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the
performance and outlook for <b>Master Limited Partnerships</b> in the
energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him
during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.
<p>Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule
for next week.  <b>ENL will be dark</b> on Thursday and Friday for the
Thanksgiving market holiday.  
<p>Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.
Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue
to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
<b>Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!</b>
<p><b>Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.</b>
