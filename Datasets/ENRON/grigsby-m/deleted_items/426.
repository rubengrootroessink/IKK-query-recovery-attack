We really enjoyed this past week with Carolyn and Andrew.  We called and
left word for you to call but ya'll must of been out of town.

Is there any chance that you could get out of Houston on Friday 11-30 by
around noon.  If so, would like to treat you to The Bluffs Friday night and
play a round of Golf Sat morning before we go to Tiger Stadium in BR.  You
can look it up on the internet www.thebluffs.com and check it out.  Let me
know if you can pull this off and will make arrangements @ bluffs and put in
for a day off myself.
Love,
Dad
