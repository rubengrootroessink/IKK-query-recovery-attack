Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain." 

Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - P! in! k Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit." But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1296&>, WR DEN - TexOK Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Bro! nc! os let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1253&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1204&>, WR SD - McKay Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1843&>, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Jones overca! me! a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Upd! at! ed 10/28/01 
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Dolphins! h! eld Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matte! r ! what the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1440&>, RB WAS - TexOK Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Ph! il! adelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=45! 03! &key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=8&>, DT DAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in ! Su! nday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

Rob Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Metz Updated 10/28/01
Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.
