Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1116&"><B>James Stewart</B></A>, RB DET - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>

Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. <BR>

Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.<BR>

Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. <BR>

Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. <BR>

The <i>Buffalo News</i> says there is a possibility Johnson might return for the season's final game. "The healing has gone very well," Gregg Williams said. "He's probably got another couple of weeks of the bone healing. We hope that he'll be able to get back into the practice situation within a couple of weeks and start to work on the field and be able to do some non-contact things. We'll continue to evaluate how it moves from that point forward." <BR>

The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.<BR>

Canidate got almost all of the carries in the second half of Sunday's game against Carolina. With St. Louis way ahead, coach Mike Martz obviously rested stud back Marshall Faulk, who had 183 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the first half. Canidate finished the game with 145 yards rushing and a touchdown. However, don't expect Canidate to get as much playing time in games where the score isn't so one-sided. <BR>

The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. <BR>

McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.<BR>

Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts. <BR>
