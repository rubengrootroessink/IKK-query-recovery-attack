He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1152&"><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=12436&"><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>, RB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the <I>Nashville Tennessean</I>
. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1070&"><B>Gus Frerotte</B></A>, QB DEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT></FONT><BR>
<BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=235220&"><B>James Jackson</B></A>, RB CLE - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1681&"><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1025&"><B>Scott Mitchell</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=133415&"><B>Akili Smith</B></A>
, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1177&"><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. !
No!
ne of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT>

While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=1645&"><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=235069&"><B>Bill Gramatica</B></A>, K ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the team's placekicker. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1680&key=187388&"><B>Bubba Franks</B></A>, TE GB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/17/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>

Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. <BR>

The <i>Buffalo News</i> says there is a possibility Johnson might return for the season's final game. "The healing has gone very well," Gregg Williams said. "He's probably got another couple of weeks of the bone healing. We hope that he'll be able to get back into the practice situation within a couple of weeks and start to work on the field and be able to do some non-contact things. We'll continue to evaluate how it moves from that point forward." <BR>

Warrick missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a hip injury. <BR>

The Chargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught five passes for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to utilize Staley as the NFL regular season winds down.<BR>

The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.<BR>

Canidate got almost all of the carries in the second half of Sunday's game against Carolina. With St. Louis way ahead, coach Mike Martz obviously rested stud back Marshall Faulk, who had 183 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the first half. Canidate finished the game with 145 yards rushing and a touchdown. However, don't expect Canidate to get as much playing time in games where the score isn't so one-sided. <BR>

The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. <BR>

McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.<BR>

Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts. <BR>
