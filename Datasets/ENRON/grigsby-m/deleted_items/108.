_____________________________________________________________________

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed off $0.05 at $67.20 today.
Friday's USDA monthly cattle-on-feed report was a mixed bag. The
placements figure was bullish, but the marketings figure was bearish. 

December lean hogs closed off $0.43 today at $49.62. Heavy hog runs
last week weighed on the futures today, as did ideas of steady to
weak cash hog trade on Tuesday. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1 1/4 cents lower at $2.04 1/4
today. Prices dropped to another fresh 3.5-month low today as the
market continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. 

January soybeans closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $4.27 today. Prices hit
a contract low in the January contract today. We had more positive
news on the export front today, in the form of weekly export
inspections being well above expectations. But still, the market
could not rally on that friendly news. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 5 cents at $2.82 today. Prices
were due for a corrective pullback this week after they pushed to a
fresh seven-week high on Friday. Profit taking was featured today
amid weak weekly export inspections figures. 

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 6.64 cents today.
Prices closed near the session low, but did hit a fresh three-week
high today. Bulls are still gaining confidence, but bears still have
the technical edge, overall. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 135 points lower at 42.50 cents today.
Prices set a contract and record low for nearby futures today. There
is no doubt the bears are in full command of coffee at present. The
only encouraging news to the bulls is the increase in volatility at
these lower price levels. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $23 lower today, at $1,003. Prices again
gapped lower today and scored a new low for the month, and that's
just another bearish clue. A new downtrend line has developed on the
daily bar chart and bears are in command. 

December cotton closed 74 points lower at 29.81 cents today. Reports
said a big "fund" sell order hit the market

to drive prices sharply lower. Prices gapped down to a fresh contract
low of 29.60 cents today. That's close to the key 29.50-cent level. 

January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 89.20. That's up
35 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices

scored a bullish "outside day" up on Friday and are now very close to
the recent high. The bulls still have the edge. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed off $4.20 today at $276.50
an ounce. More technical damage was done today in gold. Bears are
poised to push prices on down to the $275 area in the near term, or
below. 

December silver futures closed $0.038 lower at $4.235 an ounce today.
Prices hit another fresh five-week low Thursday, and have almost
filled the big upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in
early September. 

December N.Y. copper closed 15 points higher at 62.50 cents. Prices
today dropped to another fresh contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears
rule. 

ENERGIES: December crude closed unchanged at $22.26 today. Prices
scored a quiet "inside day" on the daily bar chart. Prices dropped to
a four-week low just last Thursday. A big bear flag still may be
forming on the daily chart.

December heating oil closed 14 points lower, at .6325 today. Prices
scored a quiet "inside day" on the daily bar chart today. Prices last
Thursday matched the September low. A big bear flag may still be
forming on the daily bar chart.

December unleaded gasoline closed 27 points higher at .6012 today.
Prices scored a fresh yearly low just last

Thursday. A bearish pennant pattern on the daily bar chart still
could be forming.

December natural gas closed $0.085 higher at $3.075 today. Prices
today pushed to another six-week high and closed near the session
high. Again, the nat gas market had been acting well, given the
recent downturn in liquid energies.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 73
points lower today at .8907. Prices scored another fresh six-week low
today. Bears are gaining more confidence by the day. 

The December Japanese yen closed off 94 points at .8191 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have control of the yen. 

The December Swiss franc closed 60 points lower at .6036 today. A
steep four-week-old downtrend line remains in place on the daily bar
chart. Importantly, today a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on
the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 9 points lower at .6329 today.
Significant technical damage has occurred in this currency recently.
Prices are now back down close to the April and September lows. 

The December British pound closed 98 points lower at 1.4202. Prices
fell to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have the edge. Technical
damage has been inflicted recently. First support is now seen at the
1.4100 level. First resistance is now seen at 1.4300. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 92 points higher at 116.10
today. Prices pushed to another fresh five-week high today and the
bulls are really gaining strength. It appears a head-and-shoulders
bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 4/32 higher at 106 13/32. The market
took a "rest day" today, after the recent active price action.
Recently, bull could not push prices above very strong resistance
located just above the 107 even. That gives the bears confidence. 

December S&P 500 futures closed up 20.70 at 1093.20. Prices closed
near the session high. Importantly today, prices were not negatively
impacted by the news that two postal workers in Washington, D.C. have
died from likely inhalation anthrax exposure. Many would have thought
that would have spooked the stock market. If prices can push above
last week's high of 1114.50, that would be a very positive
development for the bulls.
