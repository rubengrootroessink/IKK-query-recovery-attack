This candidate is part of the Texaco merger and is one of the people that Dynegy is trying to retain, he was referred to me as a top notch trader. He Prefers the East coast so I thought I would see if you have anything for him. He has interviewed with RWE as well they seem to be to far off in there plans for him right now.
