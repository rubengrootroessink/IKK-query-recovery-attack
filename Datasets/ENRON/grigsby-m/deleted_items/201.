Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. <BR>

Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. <BR>

Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. <BR>

Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. <BR>

Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season. <BR>
