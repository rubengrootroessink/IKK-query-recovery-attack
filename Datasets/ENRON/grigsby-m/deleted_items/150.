Latest NFL Player News

Redskins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&k! ey! =194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. 

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige0! 1&! owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1222&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Travis Henry <http://football222.fantas! y.! sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&! ra! ndom=3347&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01
According to the Dallas Morning Sta! r, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 
Greg Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1798&>, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Contra Costa Times. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.

Giggles Player News

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1140&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1757&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Germane Crowell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140 yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187503&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit. He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with confidence this week. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Raiders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01
The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. 

Deuce McAllister <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. "That was probably the best he's run the whole year," Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. "I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do." While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Mike Hollis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01
Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.
