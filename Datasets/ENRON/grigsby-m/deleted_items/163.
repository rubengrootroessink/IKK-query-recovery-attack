Mike and Joe,

Is Enron or Reliant looking for any traders?  Mike Cook used to be a
semi-pro hockey player.  I am sure he can handle his own on the trading
floor (ie - kick your ass).

He is going to be in town next week.  Are either of you up to letting
him come by and introduce himself?

Thanks,
Curtis

Dear Curtis, 

Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
enough 
to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
school at 
the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
My 
concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
Energy 
industry, either as a trader or broker.  

As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be

looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
figured 
that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
to help 
me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
be able 
to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  

I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
hire.  
If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
will be 
in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
for our 
school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
a 
beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely, 

Mike Cook
