No problem. Do you have a time of day preference? I know things are hectic in the morning with gas.

I am having trouble dialing your number.  I spoke to Randy Bhatia and he recommended you with confidence.  After reviewing your resume I would like to go ahead and recommend that you come to the interview process in November.  Please call me at work when you get a chance, 713-853-7031.

Thanks, 

Mike Grigsby
