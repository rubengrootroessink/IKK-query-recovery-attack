Mike,
Just wanted to keep you updated on the Rate Sheet project.  Franky sent me this email this morning.  Let me know if there is anything I can do for you in the meantime.

Hi Aaron,
I may not be able to get to this WestRateSheet until Mid November because I may be taking 2 week family leave starting this wednesday to care for my son.

I apologize for the delay.

Regards,
Franky

 This is the excel sheet that is linked to EOL Listen or we would like to be linked to EOL Listen that hopefully we can make a web page out of so that it can be posted on the plasma screen.
