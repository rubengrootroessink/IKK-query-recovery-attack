It gets a little complicated.  We won't be done by then and the estate isn't hiring. We might be able to take him though when we the new company is established.

John,
 
We hired Scott Freeman in the last Trading Track interviews.  He is scheduled to start January 2, 2002 after he graduates from UT.  Should I have him arrive as planned next month or let him go?
