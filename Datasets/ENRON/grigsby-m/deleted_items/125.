 	  	 Dear Mike,

I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts. 

On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The focal theme this year is "Energy markets: The challenges of the new millennium." Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energy Congress on Monday. 

Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continuing concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill. Both the House and Senate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some action on energy. There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reducing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE. The main action, however, will be behind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year. We'll bring you more details next week. 

A summit on energy efficiency is also taking place next week from Washington. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representative 
Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. We'll have all the details from the summit next week. 

Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us a report Monday on Texas wind power projects. Kim says federal and state laws helped get the idea off the ground, and now demand for wind power is allowing the market to do very well. Kim will have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday. 

The Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasoline inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool. Once the blending component is banned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies. Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on Monday. 

Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandable, but the financial crisis is not. Kym also talks one-on-one with former California Governor Pete Wilson. He gives a reflective look into what went wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do to recover. 

With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation CEO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compared to this time last year. He also reacts to word the state may attempt to renegotiate long-term power contracts. We'll bring you details from the West Coast bureau on Monday.
