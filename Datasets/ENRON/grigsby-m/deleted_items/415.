Is this report ready to be published daily?  I would update the storage info at the bottom.  Use the current storage balance for each facility, include a column showing daily activity, and show the maximum capacity and daily inj/wd capacity.  Keith will help you with this data.
 
Thanks,
 
Mike

Hi Mike, just wanted to show you what I sent Keith last week. 
I'm working on getting more info and also working on cut codes 
with Chris Hyde and Matt pena (UNIFY/IT).  

Thank you.

Keith, 

I changed the report information as you requested. 
Please let me know if there are additional changes 
you need. On some of the storage points 
the current balance information is not available. 
I will work towards getting these, in the meantime 
let me know what else would be needed.
