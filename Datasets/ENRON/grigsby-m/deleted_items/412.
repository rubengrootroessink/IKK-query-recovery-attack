Mike,

Just a quick rundown of the problems we encountered with Liz in scheduling.=
 As you know, we started her out scheduling El Paso. After about 7 weeks of=
 training and having her do intraday nominations, we put her in the weekend=
 rotation. The first weekend she worked, it became obvious that she still d=
id not understand physical gas flow. Shannon spent the whole weekend on the=
 phone talking her through any changes that needed to be made. She didn't s=
eem to remember anything that she had been trained on daily for the previou=
s 7 weeks. When I spoke to her on the following Monday, she indicated that =
she just became confused after someone tried to make a change in the nomina=
tion. We continued to work very closely with her to make her understand how=
 physical gas flow works on El Paso. I started receiving some complaints fr=
om customers who were very much aware that she didn't understand what she w=
as doing. After several more weeks, Shannon was becoming frustrated with th=
e lack of progress, so I told Shannon to write down step by step every piec=
e of the day to day nomination and renom process. That weekend went much mo=
re smoothly because Liz had every step and every scenario drawn out for her=
. I have since had her scheduling SoCal Ehrenberg while the new people are =
training and that seems to be working out OK. I think the biggest problem w=
ith Liz is an inability to think outside the box. but she is willing to wor=
k hard. I hope this helps.=20
