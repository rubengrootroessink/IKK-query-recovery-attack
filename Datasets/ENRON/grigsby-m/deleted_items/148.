Hi Mike,

I talked to Jason and had him get access to the analysis software. In the mean time, I am working with the weather group to get the temperature forecast for the rest of the winter. The weather group provide forecast only two weeks out and Jose is working on the rest of the winter forecast. If you want, I can bring you a copy of next two week's load forecast. Please let me know if you have any question.

Thanks
