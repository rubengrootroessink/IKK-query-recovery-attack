Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of November, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's December 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.  And what a bidweek it was!

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Nov. 30.  PLEASE NOTE THAT EFFECTIVE DEC. 21, THE KDOOL@MH.COM
ADDRESS WILL TERMINATE AND ALL E-MAIL SENT TO IT WILL BE LOST.  PLEASE
CHANGE YOUR ADDRESS BOOKS TO Kelley_Doolan@platts.com.

December monthly prices will be published on Monday, Dec. 3

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.


Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Kelley Doolan, chief editor

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TAKEN OFF THIS REMINDER LIST please either call me
