I am not sure how to approach this.  I appreciate your comments, but the ultimate decision will be made over the next few weeks. If you would like to resign, then let me know.

Mike

Hi Mike,

First of all, I would like to thank you
for the opportunities you presented
to me on the West desk.  Were it
not for the current situation I think it 
could have been a great way to
approach west gas trading.

Since you are busy I thought it would be
better to tell you via e-mail:  I was wondering
if you could consider me in the next round
of layoffs.  I do not know exactly how this is 
decided on the management level, but
if the topic ever comes up please bring up my name.
I have had a great time at Enron, and of making
your acquaintance, but I feel at  this point I would like to
pursue another path.

Thank you.

-Liz.
