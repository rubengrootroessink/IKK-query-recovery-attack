Please contact Jeff Hodge with the details of the cuts.  He needs the details to make the best case for Enron.  Please email your response to me before talking to Jeff.

Thanks,

Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

How should proceed with Texaco and their 1.5 million withholding?


Thanks,
Mike
