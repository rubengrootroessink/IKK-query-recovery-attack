Figured I'd send you some of my propaganda.


One thing that you didn't point out:  The "repeat blowouts" of 1973 and 1987 occurred precisely 14 years apart.  This year, of course, falls exactly 14 years from 1987.

I like the way this is shaping up.

Since 1950 (which all Sooners know is the true beginning of college football) OU has blown-out Texas by 27 or more points 7 times.  The years were; 1952, 1956, 1972, 1973, 1986, 1987, and 2000.  

The Sooners record in the year following said blow-outs is 6-0, soon to be 7-0.  Not to mention that OU repeated the blowout twice in the years 1973 and 1987.

Subsequent year scores:
1953: OU 19 Texas 14
1957: OU 21 Texas   7
1973: OU 52 Texas 13
1974: OU 16 Texas 13
1987: OU 44 Texas   9
1988: OU 28 Texas 13
2001: OU  ?  Texas  ?
