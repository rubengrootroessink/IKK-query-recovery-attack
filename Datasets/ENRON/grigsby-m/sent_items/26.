It sounds like you do not trust her work, so we should just cut bait and move her into fundies.  Let me know if you really need her for weekends.

Mike, 

Would it be possible to keep Liz in our weekend rotation for a while to help Shannon out? All of our new people are starting this week and next week but it takes a while to get them into the weekend rotation. Daniel will probably be ready to go into the rotation in about a month but until then Shannon would have to work every weekend until then. Let me know if that is something we can work out.

Thanks
Patti

We have Elizabeth Shim working on a new project.  We let her know that she will be moving into an analyst role for us in two weeks.  I asked her to give you her full focus for the remaining two weeks.

Thanks,
Mike
