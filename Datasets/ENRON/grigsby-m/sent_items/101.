Don, 

I remember him as being a passive guy.  He is very conservative, level headed, and fairly organized.  I would test his ability to handle new businesses and stress.

By the way, he worked at Coastal when I was there.

Please take a quick look at this guy and see if you know him or about him.  Ask around the desk as well.  I am a little nervous about anyone looking for a job change this close to year-end, but I need someone for my Texas markets.  Thanks for your help.

Don,

I forwarding the resume of David Horacefield.  I was wondering if you were interested in talking to this candidate as a potential replacement for Roger Reynolds.  He has good Texas Natural Gas knowledge.

Let me know.

Regards,
Todd Peikert
