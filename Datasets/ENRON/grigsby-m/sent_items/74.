Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the attached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

Thanks,
Mike
