Mike: Attached is the data you wanted for the West Desk, only.  Credit can give you the information for the entire floor.  Russell Diamond has been called back to work on the project.  I would still use Tanya as the contact.

Now that all of the data has been collected for the West, we can sort and present it however you want on Monday.

Have a good weekend.

Thanks
