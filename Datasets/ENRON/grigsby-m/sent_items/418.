Hi Mike,
 
Received the attached form back from legal.   They may some suggestions and which I added to the document.    Under the first Development area.. they asked if there was a class she could go to  to learn about products that she is week in ? Do you suggest one or is this more a learning curve from working on the floor?
 
Other than that... following your final review, legal will initial and we will schedule a meeting with Elizabeth.
 
 
Kind regards
