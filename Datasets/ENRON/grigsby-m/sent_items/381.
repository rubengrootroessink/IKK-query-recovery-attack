Mike,

I have asked Carole to start getting a signature from the traders that set curves on the changes above your threshold.  There was a curve set wrong tonight that wasn't caught until later because Keith wasn't at his desk when she walked down there, she didn't go any further than that but should have.  I will be telling my group that they can't start calculating for the night until she has all curves signed off on.   Do you have any objections to this?
