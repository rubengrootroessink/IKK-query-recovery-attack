Thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the Analyst Program.  I appreciate your time and opinion.  I have included a one page outline to help give you an idea of my accomplishments, job performance, and job development.  This outline is a guideline to help you.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you again. 

Sincerely, 

Carole Frank
