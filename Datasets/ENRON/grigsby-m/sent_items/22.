Your west desk cut us on the revised flex volumes of 30000 - none of it flowed.  I am confident they will have an excuse, but they have to know what their market is before final noms. 

We need to do something to protect our reputation in the west.  The west is difficult enough to schedule when you are selecting your counterparties, but with EOL, we have become the physical "CUT Clearinghouse" in the west.  Any internal nom errors just make it more difficult to transact reliably on EOL.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby
