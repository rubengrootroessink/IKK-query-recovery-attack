There are rumors circulating that the Associate/Analyst program will be reduced soon.  Can we address this issue with some of the Associate/Analyst employees on the floor?  Will Associates be reduced regardless of whether or not they are in a core business, etc.?

Let me know if I can address this with some of our people.
