Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:

We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:

Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quantity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.

I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Chris
