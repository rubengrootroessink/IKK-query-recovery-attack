Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues.... 

Pls advise.
