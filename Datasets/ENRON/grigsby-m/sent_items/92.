Does this need to be done before the move because inventory has already been taken at everyone's desk and it has been requested that no changes are made before we move unless necessary.  If yes, I will have it done beginning of next week and will take care of everything.

Please move the box from Janie's desk to Randy's desk as soon as possible.  You will not need Janie's approval.

Thanks,
