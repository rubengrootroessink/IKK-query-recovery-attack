That is fine.  Please give Monique's phone and box to Matt Smith as well.  I am not sure which pc to give Matt Smith, flip a coin.

Mike,

Matt Lenhart wants one of Moniques monitors.  I am already giving one to Mog.  Is it okay to give another one to Matt.

Also Matt Smith wants Moniques 2nd CPU to run his EOL.  He only needs the small form factor to run EOL.  Let me know which one you want him to have.
