Where do we stand with Texaco?  This attachment details cuts by Texaco at PG&E Topock.  We would like to use this as a potential offset to their penalties in the event they do not waive their 1.5 million charge.

Mike,

This is the sheet Anne put together on the Texaco deals. She has it saved on her hard drive so we can go back and get it any time.

Sorry it took me all day to get this to you.  Please let me know what I can do to help.  Each deal has a tab and there is a summary page up front.

I will help, please let me know.

Thanks.

Anne
