That is fine under the circumstances, but why were they sitting around for a few months without me knowing?  

Thanks,
Mike

Hello,

I didn't know you were going to be out today or I would have talked to you earlier.  We had to take some large PMA expenses today that had been sitting around for a few months.  They totaled up to about $7mil.  I did talk to Phillip about this so he knows it is coming.  

Sorry for the bad news.

Have a good weekend and maybe you'll see me on Monday.
