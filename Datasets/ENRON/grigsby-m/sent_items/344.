 The P&L was stated incorrectly again.  The new numbers just went out.  We were down 3.7 million on the day, most of that coming from the transport book that falls next to Phillip's name.

We clearly have issues with our book runners.  Gossett is trying to fix it, but the surprises keep coming.  

Let's set up a time to discuss the desk.
