Okay.  I will reserve them for you, but with the understanding that they are for Trading growth and can disappear at any time.  

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

I think it's a great idea to have a couple of spots on the floor. I would like to have the spaces and let people rotate sitting up there during trading. I think Shannon would be up there most mornings but she will need a spot downstairs since she schedules as part of a team. With Ted leaving and new people working with Shannon, she will be spending a lot of her time training. As for the Rockies area, they are all enthusiastic about learning more and I would like them to be able to rotate sitting on the floor. Let me know if that sounds OK to you.

Patti

I have added two spots on the desk for logistics.  I thought it would be best to have one rep for the Rockies, Stacy Brewer and one for the Southwest, Shannon Groenewald.  It would be nice to have Patti on the floor, but it would be like taking the teacher from the classroom.  

Let me know what you think.

Mike
