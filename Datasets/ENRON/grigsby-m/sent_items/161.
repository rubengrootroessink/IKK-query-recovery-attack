John,

Monique Sanchez submitted her resignation this afternoon. She is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc? and will not be working in the industry.  I moved all of her positions to my book today.  We have cancelled her EOL trading rights and her stack manager ID.  She will be managing the Permian cash position on EOL for my book, much like Matt and Jason are doing right now.  We have asked her to stay until October 12 so that she may complete her SJ/PERM  production and work on west fundamentals.

Please let me know if you have any problems with this arrangement.

Mike
