Hello Everyone

I have another poll for you. This week's question is....

If money were no object, would you pay 20 million dollars
for a chance to take a ride on a space shuttle as did the
millionaire Dennis Tito?

A) Yes

B) No

C) Undecided

D) What's a space shuttle?

In last week's poll, 55% of all voters said that they would
like to be chained to Sophia Loren, while 18% said they would
like to be chained to Mel Gibson.

Thanks to everyone for participating in my poll and don't
forget--today begins a new Mind Scrambler!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

TODAY'S TEASE (#738) [Thanks to Jean-Francois A Borny for
sending in today's tease.

There's a box with a hole at each end and there's a rabbit
in the box. The rabbit sticks his head out of the hole in
one end, and a minute later he sticks it out the other end.
Half a minute later, his head appears at the opposite end,
a fourth of a minute later it appears at the end opposite
to that one, an eighth of a minute later...etc., etc.

How long will it take before the rabbit sticks its head
out of both ends of the box at the same time?

At least one answer to today's tease:

In theory, two minutes. In practice, no answer is possible
unless you split hares. :)


********************* Readers Comments *********************

Jane Barbe is the "time lady."  - my gosh if that isn't an
interesting fact, that I bet nobody knew the answer to.
Joanne

                            ****

I always wanted to know who the "Time Lady" was! I must have
dialed that number forty times in a week! I wonder if she's
the operator who goes, "The number you dialed is not working
at the present time. Please hang up and try again."?

Liz

                            ****

Barbe's voice is heard by millions of people every day
announcing ETC's Audichronc time, temperature, and weather
services.

In addition, Barbe's voice speaks for the telephone
network (changed numbers, disconnects, circuits busy), Bell
laboratory computers, The National Bureau of Standards, and
many voice mail systems nation wide.

Andy Lee
[I thought this was an interesting fact too. Thanks for the
additional information Andy. Maybe this will be a question
on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" someday. Now you will
all know the answer. :)]

                            ****

If the answer was GREED I think DONALD TRUMP should be correct
also.  After all aren't those 2 synonyms.

Jeffrey
[Good point Jeff. Thanks for writing in. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]
