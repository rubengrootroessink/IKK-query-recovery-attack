Hello Everyone

I hope everyone had a great weekend. Mine was pretty nice.
Saturday night was our banquet for our bowling league.
Various monetary prizes for different achievements were
awarded. I was very shocked that I received an award, be-
cause I had what they call a "sweeper", which means that I
scored the highest over my handicap on both lanes on a
specific night. My prize wasn't a lot of money, but it was
still pretty awesome that I actually won something. As a
whole, our team placed 8th out of 15, which was an achieve-
ment because at one time we were in last place. After the
prizes were distributed, we did a cosmic bowl, which means
that all the lights are turned off and different fluorescent
lights are turned on to light up the lanes. Then we had to
do all sorts of crazy things like bowling between your part-
ner's legs and skipping down the lane and throwing with the
opposite hand. Each time one person had to throw, and if
there were any pins left up, the partner had to pick up the
spare. It was a lot of fun. I can't wait til next year! :)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

At least one answer to today's tease:

Great ease and little crosses before you are 21, great crosses
and little ease after.


********************* Readers Comments *********************

Actually the bunny will *never* poke his/her head out of each
hole at the same time. Not only because rabbits generally
only have 1 head, but because the fractions are 'tending
towards infinity'. There will never be two fractions the same,
and they will never reach 2. first it takes 1 minute, then
1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, etc...if you add all
them up you'll get something like 1.992, and if you keep going
it'll only become something like 1.9999992 !

In your answer to the daily tease about the rabbit in the box,
you said it would take two minutes for the rabbit to stick it's
head out of both ends of the box.  Actually, in theory, the
rabbit would never stick it's head out of both ends of the box,
even without taking into account the fact the rabbit only has
one head.  If you kept splitting the time in half, you would
still end up with an amount of time in beween each event of
the rabbit sticking it's head out of the box.  so even if it
were one billionth of a second, if you were to cut that in
half, it would be one two billionth of a second (then one,
four billionth of a second, then one, eight billionth of a
second...and so on.).  So what i'm saying is you can't cut
any amount of time in half, and get zero.

I don't understand your answer of two minutes.  Where do you
draw the line? 1/8 minute?  1/16th minute?  1/64th minute?
1/128th minute?  As i see it there isn't even a theoretical
answer to this one.

[Actually, I didn't think there was a possible answer for this
puzzle and it was just meant to be a joke. Sorry for the confusion.]

                            ****

For that kind of money I'd want something different, a new planet!

Sincerely yours
Rene
[Amen sister! ;)]

[Thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]
