Hello Everyone

I have another poll for you. This week's question is....

What do you think will be the most highly viewed Season
Finale?

1) Friends

2) Sopranos

3) Buffy the Vampire Slayer

4) Boston Public

5) NYPD Blue

6) ER

7) Dawson's Creek

8) None of the above

In last week's poll, the difference between spending $20
million to ride on the space shuttle or not to ride was
literally one vote. A total of 187 of those that voted said
NO while 186 said YES.

Thanks to everyone for participating in my poll and don't
forget--today begins a new Mind Scrambler!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

                    (#82)

  I am as light as a bird and as lovely flower.
  I sometime last from year to year,
  and sometime but an hour.
  I stop the swiftest railroad train,
  I break the strongest tree
  but yet I am afraid of fire.
  Children play with me.

                 What am I?

Recently, Snow White's seven dwarfs met up with three of

Doc. Doc was in front of Droopy and Happy. Sleepy was behind
Stumpy, Smelly and Happy. Happy was in front of Sleepy, Smelly
and Bashful. Bashful was behind Smelly, Droopy and Sleepy.
Sneezy was in front of Dopey. Smelly was in front of Grumpy,
Stumpy and Sneezy. Dopey was in front of Droopy. Sleepy was in
front of Grumpy and Bashful. Dopey was behind Sneezy, Doc and
Sleepy. Stumpy was in front of Dopey. Smelly was behind Doc.

********************* Readers Comments *********************

janie,

you are so nice to your readers and seem to be very curtious..
and you also have respect for your readers....so i was just
wondering how the heck you get along with the rude members
of your staff..like..tz,chadwick,& lewis..?

thank you,ur friend,
julie
[It's a rough job but someone has to do it. It doesn't hurt
to wear boots with thick heels to stomp on their foot if
they get out of line. ;)]

                            ****

I finally figured one out!!!  All on my own, before looking
at the answer!!  Aren't you proud?!? I AM!

10    4    13     7
 3     5    12    14
15    9     8      2
 6    16    1     11

Come to find out, it's different from the given answer.
Even Better!!

Keep 'em coming.....
Rachel
[Very good Rachel. Good luck on the future teases.]

                           ****

Please, please, please, publish my comments, I know you
have "millions" of e-mails from subscribers but some readers
need to be made aware of their mistakes, that is why my
original suggestion of a discussion board fot the daily
tease is a super idea.

Guy said he had discovered 190 more correct answers however
he neglected to read the correct answer and logic, the "Sun"
had to be in the middle of the word i.e. 4 letters in front,
4 letters after, 3 letters in front 3 letters after etc...
none of the words he gave qualified...

Darlene was talking about misspellings from Americans
(which would be the result of general transportation of
the language over a few hundred years).  However Neighbor
to NeighboUr =FINE and color to coloUr =FINE, but tomato to
tomatoE =WRONG and the same for potato, I don't know where
she is from but I am from Ireland and I spell tomato and
potato the same as you guys...Darlens should probably of
leart from Dan Quale's error...;-)

Oh, just with regards to the talking clock, I am pretty
sure there is 24 hours in the day not 12.  Well I think
that is all off my chest for the momment, I can breath
easier now..;-)

Take care, keep up the good work, Janie, your a star....

Derek
[Thanks for writing in Derek. I am glad you could get all
of that off your chest. I will pass on your suggestion for
a discussion board to the head honchos. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]
