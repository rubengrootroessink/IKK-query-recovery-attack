The update on this project is that it would originate a the Western end of 
the Overthrust Pipeline and continue into California.  When I asked where we 
would get the supply CIG's answer was that "we are hoping to generate 
interest from the Generation Market, they don't seem to care if there is 
supply or not they just want capacity".  For those of us who realize there is 
no supply for this pipe, CIG will be holding an open season on WIC and 
Overthrust to bring gas supplies from Cheyenne.  With the capacity on WIC an 
Overthrust you would also have a tie from Cheyenne to Kern.  I assume that 
the open season will allow you to take whatever piece you want.  There could 
be a significant opportunity here at the right rate.  We should get an entire 
packet on this next week with maps and the like and we can discuss it further 
at that time.  However, if you have questions prior to that let me know.
