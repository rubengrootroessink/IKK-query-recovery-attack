The answer to today's Riddle is -

This is a true story from Taiwan. When the rich man reached the phone
booth he found a carrier pigeon in a cage. It had a message attached
telling the man to put the diamond in a small bag which was around the
pigeon's neck and to release the bird. When the man did this the police
were powerless to follow the bird as  it returned across the city to
its owner.
