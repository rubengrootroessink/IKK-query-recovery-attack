Will you please set up two new indices in the database.  The first one will 
be NGI Southern Border, Socal.  This is different for the current NGI Socal 
border index in the system.  Also, please set up NGI Southern Border, PG&E.  
Let me know when they have been added.  These indices will begin posting in 
NGI for April, 2001.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby
