Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up 
correctly for market prices.  Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to 
Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc.  The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next 
month, does the transport work at these spreads?  

Please make the changes before prebid.

Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month.  Please 
prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.  

Thanks,
Mike
