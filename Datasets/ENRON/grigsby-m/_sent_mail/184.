The Gas Daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the 
monthly basis desk.  We are making markets on GD basis for every term and 
index point.  This creates a nice market for term gd index.  Let us know how 
you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us.  The real opportunity for 
gd basis is at socal, where the monthly index is so unreliable.
