Pablo,

Will you stop by when you get a chance to do the following:

1. set up network connection to laptop
2. download passport and gasselect on desktop and laptop
3. level the monitors

Thanks,
Mike

Ina,

Passport will probably need to be set up on Mike's desktop by an IT person. 
Most of the time they have to copy the application from my desktop
to make it work. For Gasselect, I will check with Mike and see if it is 
working. I believe all he needs is the login ID and password to make that 
work.
If you need anything else, let me know.
