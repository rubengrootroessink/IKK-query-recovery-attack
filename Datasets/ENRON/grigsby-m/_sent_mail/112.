I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas 
fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower 
hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.  We need 
to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that 
may increase gas consumption in 2001.  

Let's discuss in the afternoon. 3:30 meeting.
