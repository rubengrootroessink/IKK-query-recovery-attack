Our associates on the desk have asked why they have been included in the 
associate evaluation.  Are they in the corporate associate pool or are they 
simply designated associates on the trading floor?  No big deal - just 
forwarding their comments.

Subject: Associate/ Mid-Rotation Evaluation

As you approach the mid point in your current rotation, please take this 
opportunity to fill out an evaluation form on your experience thus far.  This 
form will enable the Program's Career Development department to monitor many 
things such as quality of work, business unit culture and knowledge gained 
within your rotation. 

You will be pleased to know that your input will be used to staff new summer 
and full time employees.  We will also be able to identify any potential 
areas of improvement within the business units.  The Career Development 
department will be able to provide valuable information and compare rotations 
amongst business units.  This information will be provided to Commercial 
Staffing Leads and other business unit leaders.

Remember, it is an opportunity to be heard.  Please complete the attached 
form and return to me via email or inter office mail.  If you would like this 
to be anonymous, please leave off your name but be sure to include your 
rotation information.  Thanks so much.
