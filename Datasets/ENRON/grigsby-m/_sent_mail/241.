I logged into the trading cluster and it appears that it is quite similar to 
general cluster.  Can we please load the programs that I emialed you 
earlier?  I am going to be out of the office in the next few weeks and I will 
need access to all trading apps.  Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
