I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
Network Neighborhood?

Thanks,
Mike
