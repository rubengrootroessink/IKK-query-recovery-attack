Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to 
discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the 
market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, 
storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and 
that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think 
we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?  
Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, 
etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?

Let's discuss in detail.

Mike
