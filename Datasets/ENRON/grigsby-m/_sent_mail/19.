Anne,

After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the 
LIQBasis tab in NCD.  The positions will include basis, physindex and gd 
index positions.  We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my 
risk will be to index postings.  This will be a huge benefit.

Gracias,
Mike
