Dale,  

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood 
on-system spread -   GD/D Malin vs. PG&E Citygate.

Call me to discuss.  Thank you.

Mike Grigsby
