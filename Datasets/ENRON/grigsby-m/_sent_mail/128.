Sorry.  The topock curve should be marked as Socal flat.  Remember that we 
show the differentials in index spreads.  Please make certain that the pg&e 
topock curves are flat to socal in the future.  Can we run a report showing 
the curveshift spread between the two points since Jan 1, 2001?  Thanks.

Mike
