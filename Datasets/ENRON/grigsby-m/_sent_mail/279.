I received a notice to provide feedback on Jose Marquez.  My review is brief, 
but very favorable.  The west desk is very pleased with Jose's contribution.  
He has gone out of his way to assist each of us.    Jose communicates the 
weather and its impact very clearly.  Let me know if you need additional 
information.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
