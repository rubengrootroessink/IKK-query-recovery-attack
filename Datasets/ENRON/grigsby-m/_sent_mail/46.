Are you the trader on this deal???  See details below.  Should this deal be 
in Sitara under two separate deals with the counterparties listed below??? 
Please advise ASAP.   They will not pay until this matter is resolved.

Thanks
Darla

There is another problem on the invoice.  According to the PG&E
transportation billing Newark Sierra Paperboard used 72758 mmbtu and
California Paperboard used 14650 mmbtu.  The total mmbtu invoiced should
be 87408 mmbtu not 87800 mmbtu.  Please bill California Paperboard 14650
mmbtu instead.  Thanks!
