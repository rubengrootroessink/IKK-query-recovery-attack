Thank you for contacting me.  The new baby is doing great.  I would like to 
add you guys to the box if you are interested.  I would also like to have 
your west physical guys on my box.  It has been brought to my attention that 
APB has great fixed price physical flow.  If you are not aware, I am running 
the physical desk as well.  Let everyone know that it will based on one 
condition - All numbers or no numbers.  We do not wish to participate in a 
closed market. 

Call me later.
