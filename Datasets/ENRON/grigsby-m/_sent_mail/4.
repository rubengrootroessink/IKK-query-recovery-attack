We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in 
sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to 
book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to 
index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale 
to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the 
cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside 
Ferc?


Thanks, 

Mike
