Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet 
and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if 
they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They 
claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be 
penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.

Thanks,
mike

I need to know what counterparties invoiced ENA for Penalties ,or netted them 
in a payment we received for December production. I will need the amount of 
the Penalty , the Counterparty , and the deal that the penalty is related to .


Unfortunately I need this information before you leave today.


Let me know if you any questions
