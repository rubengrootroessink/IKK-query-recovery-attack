I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.  We should have 
Anne fill this spot. I would like her to keep track of New Current day and 
all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your 
group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.  She can also 
put physical deals in Sitara.  Let me know what the desktop PC will need to 
be loaded with.  Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to 
accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You 
can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.

Thanks,
Mike
