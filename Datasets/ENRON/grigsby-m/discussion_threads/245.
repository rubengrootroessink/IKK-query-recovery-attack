		Dear Mike,
		
		California may see rolling blackouts again today, and ENL's Washington Bureau 
Chief Jay Cranford may get to experience them firsthand.  Jay is in 
Sacramento covering the meeting between Gov. Gray Davis and the CEOs of 
several power providers.  This afternoon, Jay brought us an interview with 
Gov. Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio.  For those of you who missed the 
4:00 p.m. EST broadcast, you can log onto ENL and find the full Maviglio 
interview in the "Video Library."  
		
		While Jay is still in Sacramento, ENL's Burke Moeller and Peter Cook are 
holding down the fort in Washington, D.C.  Burke says the D.C. bureau is 
waiting for the changes in Chairman Joe Barton's Electricity Emergency Relief 
Act.  The bill calls for some measures in short-term relief, but doesn't 
mention price caps on wholesale power.  The markup is scheduled for 
tomorrow.  The Washington bureau is also keeping tabs on Secretary of Energy 
Spencer Abraham as he testifies before the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee.  These are just a few developing stories that the D.C. 
bureau will be following tomorrow.       
		
		We'll head south from D.C. to Houston where correspondent Kim Benestante 
tomorrow is scheduled to speak with University of Houston professor Dr. 
Barton Smith.  Dr. Smith will talk about cleaner-burning fuels and air 
quality, and how Houston's energy economy is following national trends. 
Another big story from Houston involves a breach of contract lawsuit against 
IP Petroleum for failing to drill a well to a sufficient depth.  ENL talks 
with attorneys about the case tomorrow.  Be sure to catch these and other 
stories tomorrow from the Houston bureau. 
		
		Houston's Gale Smith is heading for colder climates.  We're sending her to 
Alaska for part of next week.  I'll bring you more details as they become 
available.   
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.
