Hello Everyone

It is a beautiful day here in the outskirts of Chicago. The
sun is shining, the birds are chirping and can you believe
the Chicago Cubs are actually in first place. That is truly
a miracle. Maybe with all this luck in the air, I should
run out and buy a lottery ticket. So, if I am not here tom-
orrow, you know I quit my job to run and buy a condo in the
Bahamas, and drink Margaritas by the sea. Hey, a girl can
still dream, can't she? ;)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

TODAY'S TEASE (#740) [The Mammoth Puzzle Carnival]

This puzzle tests your powers of observation. It's so tough
it'll knock you into the middle of next week," warns Lateral
Larry.

"Here is a series of six words. They don't seem to have any-
thing in common. Yet, there is one word, and only one word,
that will continue the hidden logic."

"I'll even tell you that the word I am looking for is the
name of a season in the Christian calendar. Now does that
help you?"

What word finishes the sequence?

COSMONAUT
STATUETTE
SWEDE
ENTHUSE
BOYFRIEND
VERSATILE
?

At least one answer to today's tease:

WHITSUNTIDE, because all of the words have an abbreviation
for a day of the week in the middle of them, i.e. cosMONaut,
staTUEtte, sWEDe, enTHUse, and so on.
[I am sure some of you will seek to prove Lateral Larry
wrong and that there is more than one right answer. Let me
know if you have any luck. :)]

Hi Janie,

For what it's worth, the answer to the riddle you published
was correct. The calculation is called a geometric series,
which can be summated over an infinite number of terms. Just
as it is impossible for the rabbit to stick its head out of
both sides of the box simultaneously, so is it impossible
for it to do anything in an infinitely small measure of time.

However, THEORETICALLY (and that's all we're talking here),
if you could keep splitting 1 minute by halves down to an
infinitely small measure, your last measure would be 0 (after
an infinity of splits). Therefore the sum of these times
would be 2, the initial minute, plus the half minute, quarter
minute and so on to infinity.

As Buzz Lightyear might say - "To infinity AND BEYOND!"

Cheers

P.S. What's more of a puzzle is why your readers don't know
the difference between "its" and "it's".

                            ****

The rabbit in the log tease is a direct reference to one
of Zeno of Eleas  four paradoxes. Zenos first parodox was
that all motion was impossible because in order to reach
your destination you must first reach the halfway point.
Then treat the halfway point as the new starting point and
repeat the logic, ie the next step you must reach the 1/4
pont, then the 1/8 point... ect. using this logic it is
impossible for anything to ever move anywhere. Whats the
problem with this logic? It dosn't allow for a fundamental
aspect of calculus, that of infinity and zero. So if you
were in calculus 101 class and they gave you the rabbit
in the log tease as a home work problem you whold know to
take limit of the sum of 1+1/2n as n goes to infinity and
come up with the answer that the rabbit will have its head
out of both sides of the log as a time of 2 minutes. Its
some how good to know that a self-taught counrty boy who
proposed his paradoxes around 500 BC is still baffleing
people 2500 years later! love the teases, Cris

                            ****

Cute pun, but a rabbit and a hare are different animals.
The defining difference being that a hare's young are born
with their eyes open, with hair and able to hop a little
shortly after birth, whereas a rabbit is born hairless
(hareless? sorry couldn't resist!) blind and helpless.
Hares:

Rabbits: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=3D63924
A lot of the times the names are used for the wrong animal,
for instance, the Blacktailed Jackrabbit is actually a
hare, and the Belgian Hare is really a rabbit.

A Jane Barbe Fan club
When I found out the Jane Barbe was the one that made
that recording of all thouse Time messages.  I sent a message
to all my relative and friends that I was starting up a Jane
Barbe Fan club. And heres why!

She did a remarkable job I listen to every one of her time
messages this morning and last night and you would thing you
might hear her taking a drink of water or eating a bite of
food. But she was flawless.  I had a hard time staying awake
for 24 hours as she did that whole thing. My ear could only
make it for 4 hours before I got the Idea to put it on the
speaker phone.

How old is she do you have any auto graphed pictures ?
Thank You
Leland
[I am sorry I don't have any other information on her. I am
sure if she is out there and reading this, she will be very
honored to have such a devoted fan. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]
