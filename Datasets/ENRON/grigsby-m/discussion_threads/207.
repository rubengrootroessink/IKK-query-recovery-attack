Energy Commission Staff Completes Assessment
of Proposed Peaker Power Plant Project in Hanford


Sacramento - The staff of the California Energy Commission has
recommended approval of the proposal by GWF Power Systems Company for
a 95-megawatt peaker power plant at Hanford Energy Park in Kings
County.

The Hanford Peaker Project is a simple cycle, natural gas-fired power
plant proposed for construction and operation on a site immediately
adjacent to the existing GWF Hanford cogeneration plant, just north
of Idaho Avenue. If approved, the facility is expected to start
commercial operation August 1, 2001.

The Staff Assessment of this project can be viewed and printed from
the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers/hanford/documents

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Friday,
April 20, 2001.

A Proposed Decision on the Hanford project, which will also be
available on the Energy Commission's Web Site, is being released
today.

The full five-member Energy Commission will consider the Proposed
Decision at its business meeting as follows:

THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2001
Beginning at 10 a.m.
California Energy Commission
1516 Ninth Street
Hearing Room A
Sacramento, CA
(Wheelchair Accessible)

The proposed Hanford Park Peaker Project applied to the Energy
Commission's emergency siting process to meet this summer's
electricity needs. The goal of the emergency process is to license
power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, without
sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

Typically, peaker power plants are simple-cycle generators that can
be constructed in a relatively short period of time, readily
connected to the existing electricity transmission and natural gas
system, and dispatched quickly to meet peak electricity demands.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. Persons
may contact Ms. Mendonca by e-mail at <pao@energy.state.ca.us>. For
information regarding proposed projects in Northern California, call
(877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in Southern
California, call (800) 273-4459.

Information about the proposed project is available on the Energy
Commission's Web Site at:
