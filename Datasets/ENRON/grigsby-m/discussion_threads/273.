QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================

"Is the question, How fully can we engineer the human body to
do physically impossible things? If it is, what do you have
at the end of that? Something that looks like a human, but
is so engineered, so tuned, that it's no longer going to do
what the body is designed to do."

- DR. THEODORE FRIEDMANN, director of the gene therapy program at the 
University of
California at San Diego.

OP-ED COLUMNISTS
=========================

By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN: Empty Deeds, Ugly Words

For the son of Hafez al-Assad to be accusing anyone of
religious intolerance is laughable.

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/opinion/11FRIE.html


By GAIL COLLINS: The Year of the Stork

Ever since Jane Swift ran for lieutenant governor of
Massachusetts, her life has resembled one of those old
"Airport" movies in which there's a bomb on the plane.
