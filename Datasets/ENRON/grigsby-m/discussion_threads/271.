Hello Everyone

Congratulations to "LESLIE SMITH" who won this week's "Mind
Scrambler". If you're the winner please email me your com-
plete name and address for your prize. Here was the question:

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

The answer is: THE FUTURE. Some of the answers I received
were: YOUR IMAGINATION, MEMORIES, A WEDDING RING and YOUR
HEART. Also, for those of you that missed it, the answer
to last week's puzzle was: GREED.

As always, if you're not a winner this week, stay tuned...
on Monday you will have another chance at "Janie's Mind
Scrambler". Have a good weekend everyone!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

TODAY'S TEASE (#742) [Giant Book of Mensa Mind Challenges
by Jaime and Lea Poniachik, Tim Sole, Rod Marshall and
J.J. Mendoza Fernandez]

On the 29th of last month, there was a double murder on the
express train from Paris to Berlin. The engineer and the
conductor were killed at the same time, even though they
were at opposite ends of the train. This was confirmed by
a police detective, who was the exact center of the train
and heard both gunshots at the same time.

When my cousin was told the story, he realized that both
victims did not die at the same time.

How did he figure it out?

At least one answer to today's tease:

If the police detective heard the shots at the same time, it
means that the men could not have died at the same time. If
both sounds had occurred at the same time at opposite ends of
the train, he would have first heard the one from the front
car, because the speed of the train was added to the speed
of sound. For the sound from the back of the train, the speed
of the train was subtracted from the speed of sound. For the
detective to hear both shots at once means the man at the back
of the train was killed first.


********************* Readers Comments *********************

Hi Janie,  I think that Darlene was talking about a completely
different word. Darlene was thinking of the word Suede (swayed).
You wrote the word Swede (sweed).  The word was spelled corr-
ectly in your puzzle.  Darlene simply mis-identified it.

Hi Janie,

Just one comment about "Guy's" response to your "days of the
week" tease. He gave you several answers which *contained*
the letters SUN.  However, *none* of them had SUN in the exact
middle of the word (as the answer had to be).  You need to
have the same number of letters before and after the SUN to
be a correct answer.  Nice try, Guy.

I really enjoy your daily teases.........they do keep my
brain waves churning......something which my job has failed
to do for me lately!

Paula
