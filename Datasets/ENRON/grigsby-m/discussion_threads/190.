Executive Summary

? The likely outcome of the 16 May elections is a victory by the BC Liberal=
=20
Party (currently holding polls at 70%), a pro-business, right-of-center par=
ty=20
led by Gordon Campbell. =20
? Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libera=

government.

BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire
? BC Hydro=01,s additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable

Liberal Party Platform

? Income tax cut that would make BC=01,s income tax the lowest in Canada
? Independent audit of the province=01,s books amid allegations of NDP=20
mismanagement and incompetence
? Review of all Crown corporations (including BC Hydro) to enhance efficien=

and management quality
? Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax,=
=20
the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n=20
the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the=20
privatization of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission=
=20
assets, as well as increased government support for independent power=20
producers and coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and=
=20
attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could=
=20
lead to a lack of clarity about the province=01,s overall energy strategy o=
ver=20
the next few years.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and=
=20
of expanding coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, =01&an as=
set=20
that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in=
=20
BC.=018  A high-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the pro=
vince=20
back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting n=
ew=20
technology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from=20
environmentalists.  =01&These are confrontational moves, and people will be=
 on=20
the streets.=018=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh=20
we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature aft=
er=20
the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party=01,s energy, m=
ining=20
and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if right-wing=
=20
Liberals are dissatisfied with the party=01,s performance after the May=20
election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this giv=
es=20
Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a=20
high-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
=20
would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The BC=
=20
government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991=20
(roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the=20
utility=01,s ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and inv=
est=20
in the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund,=
=20
something that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly=
=20
intends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls f=
or=20
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C=20
Hydro=01,s out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given th=
e low=20
snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Supporti=
ng=20
this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hydro=01,s=
 key=20
trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to rely upon=
=20
British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next f=
ew=20
years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it=20
through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a low snow pac=
k,=20
a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern=20
about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro=
=20
to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C=20
Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, =01&We =
need=20
to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producers an=
d=20
consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis.=018 He stated that=20
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. =01&I want=
 to=20
change that big time,=018 he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbe=
ll=20
also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and=20
co-generation plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
=20
leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, =01&We have no intentio=
n of=20
selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines=
,=20
no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling their=
=20
reservoirs.=018  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29 =
April=20
that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commented tha=
t=20
Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC=20
Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, transmissio=
n=20
lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening the sector=
=20
up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
=20
part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
=20
Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro=01,s distribution channels and its e=
nergy=20
trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Libera=
l=20
finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (after=
=20
Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro=01,s non-core=20
businesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing,=20
could come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro=01,s Williston hydro-generation facil=
ity=20
are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170=20
Gwhs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan=01,s=20
additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to=
=20
cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close =
to=20
the Minister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that=20
levels at Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzie=01,s=20
operational limits due to concern over political backlash.=20
