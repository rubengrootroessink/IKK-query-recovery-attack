Hello Everyone

Yet another week is drawing to a close. I am very excited
about this weekend. Saturday my older brother is graduating
from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. He has
worked very hard for this and I am very proud of him. Also,
with Sunday being Mother's Day, we are going to have a cook
out at my boyfriend's uncle's house to celebrate. It should
be a lot of fun. I would like to wish all of you mothers
out there a wonderful day and to let you know how much I
respect you for the awesome jobs you are doing raising your
families. I hope that one day I can be a part of such an
elite and incredible group of individuals. :)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

Hi Jane,

You were right, I just had to prove Lateral Larry wrong.  I
immediately thought of tSUNami as a correct answer also (the
Christian holiday reference was supposed to be a hint for
the "only one logical solution" and not meant to additionally
limit the answers).  I figured there must be others too, and
did a quick search.  There are at least  190 more "correct
answers".  Some of them are:

sunup, suntan, (all other sun... compound words too), sunnah,
sunn, sunk, Velsuna, Utsunomiya, sung, sunder, sundae, misun-
derstood, Asuncion, asunder, bosun, disunion, gesundheit,

Keep up the good work Jane!  Also, I'm still waiting on your
reply to my proposal (since your boyfriend hasn't proposed yet,
what are you waiting for????  LOL).

Guy
[I will give him the benefit of the doubt for now, but I
will let you know if anything happens. lol Thanks for the
info, I knew you guys would not let me down. :)]

                            ****

It is interesting that suede is spelled with a "w" instead
of a "u" in the States.  I have never seen it spelled that
way before, so I guess it must be a regional (albeit country
wide) thing, like how you Americans misspell neighboUr,
tomatoE, potatoE, coloUr, etc (LOL).   Seriously, though, I
thought it was a typo because that is not how it is spelled
in countries outside of the US (like so many other words,
including the above examples).  Because I thought it was a
typo, I just spelled it "correctly" mentally, and so was
unable to solve the puzzle (not like I'd have solved it had
I known though).  Have a good day and keep up with the good
work that you do.

Darlene
["The Mammoth Puzzle Carnival" was actually published in
England so forgive me for the foreign spellings. It is
getting harder and harder to find original material to
baffle and bamboozle all of you. But I will keep trying.]

                            ****

Janie,

Keep dreaming ... that's what it's all about ...

and ... the lottery is only the little picture!

All the best,
KAD
[And the best to you as well. As in the moral words
of Casey Kasem, "Keep your feet in the ground and keep
reaching for the stars."]

For Leland re: Jane Barbe and the time announcements.

Am sure the tape (or whatever) was not made in one sitting.
Her male predecessor recorded, took a break, recorded some
more, until the entire twelve hours was on tape, then the
tape was electronically edited to synchronize it with the
atomic clock. Regardless, she IS good at what she does!!
Lloyd
[Thanks Lloyd, I am sure you are right and that tape was not
made in one sitting. And she is great at what she does, just
like I am sure all of you are great at what you do! :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]
