Today's Riddle is -


Today we have two riddles again.
 1. What common English verb becomes its own past tense by
rearranging its letters?
 2. If it takes a man one hour to dig a hole two meters long,
two meters wide, and two meters deep, how long would it take
the same man to dig a hole four meters long, four meters wide,
and four meters deep, assuming he digs at the same rate of speed?

The answer to today's Riddle is -

1. Answer: Eat becomes Ate
2. Eight hours. It takes twice as long to double the length, twice
as long to double the width, and twice as long to double the depth.
To find cubic measurement you multiply length x width x height;
therefore, on the first hole, one hour equals 2 m x 2 m x 2 m or
8 cubic meters. On the second hole, the formula is 4 m x 4 x 4 m
or 64 cubic meters.
