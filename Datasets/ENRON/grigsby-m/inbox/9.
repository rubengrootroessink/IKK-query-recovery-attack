Mike,

This is the sheet Anne put together on the Texaco deals. She has it saved on her hard drive so we can go back and get it any time.

Sorry it took me all day to get this to you.  Please let me know what I can do to help.  Each deal has a tab and there is a summary page up front.

I will help, please let me know.

Thanks.

Anne
