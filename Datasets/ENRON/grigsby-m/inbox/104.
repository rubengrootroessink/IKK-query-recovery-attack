Hi Mike, just wanted to show you what I sent Keith last week.
I'm working on getting more info and also working on cut codes
with Chris Hyde and Matt pena (UNIFY/IT).  

Thank you.

Keith,

I changed the report information as you requested.
Please let me know if there are additional changes 
you need. On some of the storage points
the current balance information is not available.
I will work towards getting these, in the meantime
let me know what else would be needed.
