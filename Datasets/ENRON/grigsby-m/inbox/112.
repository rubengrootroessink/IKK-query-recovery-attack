We will move this to his book Tuesday.

We have also started posting the price and position reports to the website.  We will stop e-mailing these out after today.  
There will be 13 new curves in your gas daily curves for the EOL curves starting no later than Wednesday.  These are all the curves the EOL website reports for the West desk.


Thanks

Kam
