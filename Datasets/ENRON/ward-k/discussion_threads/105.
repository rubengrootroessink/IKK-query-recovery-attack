Hi, Kim.

Finally had a chance to look over the term sheet.  Unfortunately, I won't be
in on Friday.  Can we talk about this on Monday?  Looks mostly okay; just
want to discuss some of the terms.  I assume this is mostly in accordance
with our agreement.  Also, there may be a few errors with the numbers...
Offhand: because of the losses on the PG&E pipe, our KRS will be
3944MMBtu/day at KRS.

Monday is a completely unfettered (meetingwise) day for me.  I'll be in at
7:30 PST.

Have a nice weekend.

-Steve

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet detailing how we would like to handle your gas
supply  for February, 2001. Once I get through the Feb crunch, I hope to
provide you with a similar proposal for March through the balance of the
year.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to
discuss any of the items in the term sheet.

Thanks,

Kim
