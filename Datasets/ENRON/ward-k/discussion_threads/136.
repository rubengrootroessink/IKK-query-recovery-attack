I have attached my latest version below.  I still have not located historical 
monthly index prices for AECO and PG&E City Gate.  However, in lieu of the 
index numbers I have dropped in the average historical daily prices for each 
month.  Please let me know if you think this is sufficient for your 
purposes.  Also, let me know if you need any other 
interpretations/representations of the historical data.
