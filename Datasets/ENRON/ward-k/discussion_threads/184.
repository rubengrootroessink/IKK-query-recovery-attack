Just to let you know, sort of a "heads up", that I have also invited Dave 
Plumb
to the meeting this Friday.  I hope you can understand that I must follow
protocol here.  I suspect out past unsuccessful negotiations may be a topic of
discussion for him, however, I do not know this for a fact.

I told him you two were in the Valley making your Spring customer calls and 
Mesa
was slated for approximately 10:30 a.m. until noon+(?) with lunch included.  I
thought we would go up the street to Rigatony's.  Sound good??

Dave, this might be an opportunity for you to ask any questions regarding the
electric RFP.  I don't know the results or if they have even made a decision
yet.

Hopefully we can talk about where we have been, where we are now, and what the
future looks like.  Also the possibilities and potential for continued 
business.

Looking forward to seeing and visiting with both of you this Friday.

Jan
