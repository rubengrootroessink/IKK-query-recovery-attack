Group,

Just wanted to let you know that Anna will be handing out the December 
Coverage Metrics Sheets this afternoon.  She will also be collecting your 
November Coverage Metrics Sheets, which you should have filled out the 
"November Actual Column," representing how many times you talked with each 
counterparty during the month of November.

Thanks for your co-operation,
Stan
