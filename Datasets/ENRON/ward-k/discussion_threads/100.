Kim,

Mike McDonald and I are meeting with the President of Knauf next week.  The 
topic for discussion is energy supply to their facility currently under 
construction in Shasta Lake, CA.  We have previously bid power supplies to 
Shasta who, in turn, sell the power to Knauf.  Knauf wants to meet directly.  
They also want us to look at providing their gas needs - about 2.5 MMcfd.

Can I get your help in getting quotes for natural gas supplies to their 
facility.  I need PG&E city-gate prices for a 1, 4 and 9 year, 2.5 MMcfd 
baseload supply starting July 1, 2001.  I will ask Tracy Ngo about credit.

We are meeting with Knauf next Thursday in Indianapolis, so I need pricing by 
late Tuesday.  We need to leave at the crack of dawn on Wednesday to get to 
Indy.

Thanks,

Laird
