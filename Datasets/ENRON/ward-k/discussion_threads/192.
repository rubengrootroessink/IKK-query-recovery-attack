Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see 
you.
I hope Enron can get some of their "creative juices" going and figure out a 
way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant 
is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There 
are
some hurdles, but all "doable" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a "learning mode" regarding electric and was wondering if you 
could
just "jam" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

Let me know.

Jan
