Patti/Kim:

Can you handle this?  Put a deal in the system to deliver a total of 3000 
MMBtu plus fuel into the Citizens IT agreement and schedule it to the Nogales 
delivery point.  Do it some time before the end of the month Citizens will 
pay the transport bill. They will pay us for the gas.

This is to confirm our conversation today requesting that Enron delivery
3,000 Dth to Nogales #3 (Power Plant) under Citizens' El Paso interruptible
