Kim,

As promised, here are all the files I have on California entities' gas 
assets/contracts.  I have summarized what they are below.  Some of the data 
is old; however, I think most of it largely reflects current usage, etc.....



1.  GS_ACCRD:  Palo Alto gas load summary.
2,  SMUD Assets & Load
3.  CA-Power-Plants:  summary of all generation assets in California
4   DWP Gas Assets:  Summary of gas Transport Assets & Contracts
5.  gas consumption:  LADWP historical gas use
6.  Gas Fired Resources:   LADWP's Asset Summary
7.  Glendale Loads..:  Generation Asset Summary
8.  LOADPROF:  City of Long Beach Historical Load Data
9.  Prepay:  Summary of Quantities & Physical Delivery Premiums
10.  Santa Clara's Generation Asset Summary
11.  Usage History:  1998 Pasadena Gas Data
