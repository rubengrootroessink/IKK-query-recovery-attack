hey, thanks for the email.  I will try to help.  I really like doing things
like that, but enjoy it more when you know something about the people you are
helping.
 How was your thanks giving?  I tried to rsvp regrets for harriets baby
shower, but was never able to get anyone at that number. (?)  Did you have a
good time?  Did H have a good time?  what does she look like pregnant??  your
invitations were really cute.
so what is new with you?  Still like portland?   Any new men?   Did H tell
you that we finally have filed for divorce?  Should be done in about a month
since neither of us is contesting it, and all our property has been divided
for about 3 years now.   What are your plans for christmans?  staying in
portland?   you know, your adopted family sounds like someone i know that
moved up there and is now separated... you don't know names do you ??
anyway  write soon.   I'll send a check for your cause  i think its great.
               miss you     angie
