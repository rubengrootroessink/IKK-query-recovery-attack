Ken,

I wanted to give you a pricing update.  Prices in the near term the next couple of years have come off.  Call me when you get some time.

Ken,

Attached is the revised pricing per our earlier discussion.  I want to emphasize the importance of having various suppliers provide you with competitive prices at a active trading hub like Palo Verde.  We would be happy to discuss with you how we can get you access to these competitive prices while maintaining reliable delivery to Mesa's Preferred Delivery Points.  Please call me with any questions in regards to our proposal.

Best Regards,

Paul Choi
