Just a refresher in case you need it today (off of last nights curve and 
assuming Grigsby's offer is .04)

Kim, 

Here is the summary.  The bottom line is that by unwinding balance of 
February (2/20-2/28) and the rest of the deal (Mar '01-Jul '02) from a $3.74 
price to a $4.18 price nets Mesa a $.24 discount of the new Index deal (Aug 
'01-Jan '02)

To get them to a $.30 discount on the new Index deal, Mesa would need to 
raise the fix price on the current deal to $4.26.

Eric
