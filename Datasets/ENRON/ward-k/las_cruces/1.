The attached (1) Preliminary Information, (2) Gas supply requirements:
Years 1-3, and (3) Time Schedule are for your planning purposes.

I would greatly appreciate your comments on how we could structure a gas
purchase agreement with your firm in terms of contract length and pricing
formula.

I look forward to hearing from you for further information and your comments
prior to August 1, 2001.
