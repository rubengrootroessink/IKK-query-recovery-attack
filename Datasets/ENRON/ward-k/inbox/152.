Kim - great catching up with you today. As promised, I have attached my
resume'. Robin and I are very interested in relocating to the Denver area.
My experience over the last few years has been in creating Mid Market
origination channels for retail commercial and industrial customers. Thanks
for forwarding my resume' on to your contacts in the western US area.

Regards,

Pete
