We can certainly net the amounts if Pasadena ends up owing us one month, but I only have information to complete invoices through June 2001 and we owe Pasadena for all three months.  I was under the impression that Pasadena wanted to resolve some of these months as quickly as possible.  

I have sent the spreadsheets for May and June to Patti for her to look over before I send them to Pasadena.  I have not heard back from her yet.  You may be able to help, though.  Do you know the negotiated prices for the El Paso fixed capacity for May forward?  I need them to finish the calc sheets.  Patti was going to look them up for me, but she hasn't had a chance yet.  I have attached the May and June files in case you want to review them.   I need the price for the box highlighted in yellow on each sheet.  As soon as I have all of the information for July forward, I can finish the invoices.  I am still in need of the El Paso deliveries, the Kern River deliveries and the nomination email from Pasadena for each month.

Megan,

Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?  If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?  Can we check into that?

Let me know - 

Kim

Steve:
I have taken over your account from Janine Cashin and am working on the invoices for April forward.  As I complete them, I will send them to you for settlement.  The April 2001 Calc sheet and Invoice are attached.  Enron plans to wire the City of Pasadena $1,853,770.40 on Friday, 11/30/01.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
