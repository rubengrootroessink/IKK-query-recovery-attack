Wow!  sorry to hear about all that.  i didn't even know you were dating
someone, i am way out of the loop.  whoever he was is obviously a fucking
idiot.  i've told you before my opinions of you and i'll tell you again
anytime.  you do have a lot going on but look at it this way, it can only
get better from here.  i might still try and come to houston, just not sure.
will let you know.  hope everything gets better for you....

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an
earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my
company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am
broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my
ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when
it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I
am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone
to take over at this point - - - -

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple
of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have
told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is
still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge
way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going
to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will
survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry
to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for
you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash
crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who
knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you
are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week
ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....
