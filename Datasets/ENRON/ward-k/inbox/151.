Hey Kim,

Hope all is well.  You have been on my mind a lot so I thought I would try to
get in touch with you.  I am now back at home after taking a severance
package with Kraft.  Sept. 6, we had a new addition to the family...Don...who
is so sweet and big.

Are you going to Memphis over the holidays?  I would love to get together!

Take care and let me hear from you!

Much love,

Yonnie
