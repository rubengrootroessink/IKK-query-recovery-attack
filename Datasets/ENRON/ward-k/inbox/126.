Elizabeth, 
 
As we discussed by telephone this morning, it has become necessary for Citizens to request cancellation of all capacity releases with Enron North America  effective the soonest available date.  As we discussed this morning, notification received by 8:00 central time November 29, would make recall effective November 30, 2001. 
 
You had requested the following information:
