The hotel we are staying at is the Palm Court Hotel in St Martin-on Orient
Beach. Phone number is 590-87 41 94.  Web site (if you want to check it out
tomorrow!) is palm-court.net...The rooms have refridgerators, and I think
breakfast is complimentary. If you need any other info, let me know..

Stacey/Susie-just tell the cab driver you are going to Orient Beach and
once you get there the hotel is on Bikini Beach.
