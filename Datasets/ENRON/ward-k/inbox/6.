so glad to hear from you and h glad you weren't galavanting around the country somewhere.  I just don't know what to think about all this stuff.   it's like emotional overload.   so so awful. 
 i am really not a happy camper right now.  with life, jeff, job and kids.   don't know what to do about it either.   i really think that if jeff would just give it up and please leave me alone it would really really help. 
 i am glad your friend mike wasn't in ny.  my bosses wife was in washington dc  they were staying 3 blocks from the capital.  he came back on monday, she had a meeting until tues.  she still isn't home.  she and 2 doctors she was with finally rented a car and are on their way back.  there are so many stories.  i don;t think ther is one single person who has not been affected by this.  
  any way   hugs and kisses   glad you are safe.     ang
