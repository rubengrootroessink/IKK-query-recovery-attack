Kim:  Everything on the list is complete.  You were granted $11,500 tonight.  I have been working with Darla to make sure that John Cogan has been paid each month.  We are caught up on his payments.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks

Anne

Anne,

Please book the following accrual origination from grigsby's book to myself and Chris Foster ( 50% each):

June 2001	$9,566.58
July 2001	$5,706.52
Aug 2001	$7,736.97

Also, are you the one that I need to inform of what to pay John Cogan?  And if so, what months and amounts have we paid him?

I will have september ready today or tomarrow and October ready by the 10th which will be our standard procedure.  Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks,

Kim
