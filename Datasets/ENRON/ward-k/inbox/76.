OK, just talked to LP

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.
