k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....
