Hi Kim,

Just wanted to say, well I don't really know what to say.  For what its
worth, you guys are the sharpest group of traders and one of the most
innovative companies I have ever dealt with.  You'll find a way through
this.

If you need to reschedule our meeting Tuesday evening I completely
understand.

Thanks,
