i finished and it was still light out, i'll just leave it at that.  i was
sick all last week and still am so i was having a really hard time catching
my breath.  i did finish though.  went to a great restaurant, el gaucho???
i was surprised that i had never been there on business, the steak was
excellent.  leaving for cda a week from tomorrow, coming back friday night
or saturday morning, undecided as of right now.  as far as it being
beneficial for you to go, is it beneficial for me to go to these trips?  who
knows, but i go because it's fun and it's free.  i plan on playing a lot of
golf and hitting the spa frequently.  you should definitely go, i'm sure
it's been a week or so since your last vacation.  let me know what you
decide, it would be good to see you, especially the week after the big
uga-ut game....

How was the marathon?  How long did it take you to finish?  When are you
going to Ceour d'Alene?  Do you think it would be beneficial for me to
show up?
