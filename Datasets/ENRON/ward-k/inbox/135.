Exelon Energy, our gas marketer, has terminated their gas contract with
Holtermann Farms effective the end of the December 2001 billing period.
Southern California Gas Company provides transportation to our non-core
account. Holtermann Farms has two irrigation wells that have the heaviest
natural gas consumption during the summer months. If your company would be
interested in being our gas marketer, please contact me at
tholtermann@hotmail.com.

Thank You
Tim Holtermann
