Here is the Citizens invoice I found for July 2001.  Darla is out today, so I will check with her the morning on the PPL piece.

Will you check our systems and invoice for July for the Citizens Griffith deal and let me know what we have billed/paid citizens and PPL for July 17th and July 26.  There are some significant discrepancies with these counterparties that need to be addressed ASAP.  Please let me know what you find.  You can call me at x30685.

thanks,

Kim

Hey Kim,

Please contact Megan Parker from now on for Citizens.  I will be helping transition this off to her, but most of the activity needs to be addressed with her.


Thanks!!
