Good morning Kim,

I have a few questions to ask regarding natural gas.

1. Do you require a new customer to have a minimum load?  Is there also a
maximum?

2. Must they be in a particular territory, for example SoCalGas?

3. What length contracts are you offering?

4r. What financial hedges do you offer?  NGI, Fixed, Caller (ceiling / floor
caps) etc.

5. Are you looking for agency relationships?  Do you pay a commission if
business is brought to you?

If you have any questions, please call me directly at (949) 655-7363.
Please respond at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time,

Jenni Rougvie
