YEAH!  GO VOLS!!!
Tennessee was great.  Trip did not last long enough.  Sorry you are faced
with lay-offs around the holiday season.  I am a worrier too.  I think it
will work out for you... let me know if I can do anything (remember I have
friends in H.R. at Dynegy).

I would like to invite Pierce, Stacey, and Donna (you met them on the ride
and Suzanne knows them).  MAYBE Joe Gordon (he's a Tennessee fan too).
That's it for me.  I'll bring my orange and white pom-poms and other
Tennessee stuff plus beer and snacks... let me know how much/what you think
we'll need!

Terri,

We are definitely watching the ballgame at suzanne's on saturday.  I am
getting an email list together so if you have some people you want to add,
just let me know.  How was Tennessee and your Thanksgiving?  Mine was just
so, so.  Worrying about work and my friends (and self) getting laid off.  I
do hope all is well with you - call me sometime this week -

Kim

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the
party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great
time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim
