Kim, thanks for your quick response and patience.  We're going to do
something.  My guess is next week.  I guessed $5.20 this morning in some
analysis I did so the magnitude of the change in price was not unexpected.

Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent
price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January,
2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex
for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the
little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you
need -

Thanks,

Kim
