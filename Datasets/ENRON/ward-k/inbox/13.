Kim -

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda? 

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Thanks,

Kim
