The contract provides for a Material Adverse Change if our credit rating goes below BBB- which it has.  This is a triggering event.  When this occurs they can initiate the process moving to terminate the agreement.

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?
