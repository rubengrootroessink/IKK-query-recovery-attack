Market Summary (as of 12/31/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Quiet start for 2001 finale
Provided by MSN Money

A quiet session dawns as investors complete the worst stock-market year since the 1970s. The motivations to head home early seem to outweigh any inclination to trade. Exchanges closed for the day in Japan and most of Europe, the U.S. bond market wraps up at 1 p.m. ET and tomorrow, of course, is the New Year?s holiday.
<p>
Volume could be light today, CNBC?s Mary Thompson reports from the lightly staffed New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
Stocks started very slightly lower, despite a rise in futures before the opening bell. Consumer-products stocks, biotech firms and waste-management companies posted the biggest early declines -- though each sector was down less than 3% on the day.
<p>
Regardless of today's activity, 2001 will wind up a dismal stock-market year. The S&P 500 index, down about 12% in the past 12 months, will post its worst annual drop since 30% in 1974. And the Dow industrials will wrap up their first back-to-back yearly losses since 1977-78. Stocks have come back strongly since mid-September -- but not nearly enough to buff out the damage of the previous nine months.
