Happy Holidays  All,
 
I am just wanting to notify you all that  I have a new personal email address(other than what you may have loaded in your  address book):  wgwlonestar@aol.com 
 
Please begin to use this email address to  communicate with me.
 
I did not get to send out Holiday/Christmas  cards this year to everyone, so please accept this as my Holidays/Christmas and  New Years Greetings.  May you all enjoy yourselves these next couple of  weeks.
 
Best Wishes and Seasons  Greetings,
 
Bill
