Hi Kim,
I was just thinking about you.  If I'm remembering correctly, you have a
birthday sometime this month, is that right?  Let me wish you a happy
birthday (late or early)!  Hope everything is going well for you.  Maria,
Janice, Sonya, and Sylvia still talk about how nice you are and what a great
person you were to work with.  I've tried to tell them how mean you are, but
they just will not believe me.  If this note goes through to you, write back
and I'll forward your reply on to those Day Ahead ladies, they would get a
kick out of hearing from you.  By the way, Maria wants to know how old you
are?   :o)
Happy B-day Kim!

Your friend,
Dave OLander
