By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of
the numbers coming out of New York, Washington and

Pennsylvania.

The sad but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not
reported yet - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about the attacks.

*** The Buildings ***

*The World Trade Center -

The twin towers of the World Trade Center were places of employment for
some
50,000 people. With the missing list of just over 5,000 people, that means
90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A 90% on a test is an 'A.'

* The Pentagon -

Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon.
The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing
99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low,
too early to affect a large portion of the building. On top of that, the
section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations
that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had
recently
completed straightening and blast proofing, saving untold lives.  This
attack was sad, but a statistical failure.

*** The Planes ***

* American Airlines Flight 77

This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats
were empty.

* American Airlines Flight 11

This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard, but only carried
92.
Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.

* United Airlines Flight 175

Another Boeing 767 that could have seated 351 people only had 65 people on
board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.

* United Airlines Flight 93

This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had
84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving
untold numbers of lives in the process.



*** In Summary ***

Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept
cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate
than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplant
-
all common, survivable illnesses.

The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's
strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade
Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives.

Don't fear these terrorists. The odds are against them.


GOD BLESS AMERICA
