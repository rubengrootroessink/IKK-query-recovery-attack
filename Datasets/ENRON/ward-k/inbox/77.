No room on the LC's and they would have to be on the higher side. A more detailed look at their performance showed that they have not had a great year at all. Their equity has continued to erode.

Talked to them this morning and refreshed the basis numbers down a bit.  Told them about the LC requirements and they puked but didn't say that it was over.  If this deal doesn't get done today, it won't get done because we will have to add them to our Socal Pool on Monday.  Any room on the LC's?  They asked.  I think if we didn't ask them to post, they would do the deal.
