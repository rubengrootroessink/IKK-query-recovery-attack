Hey Kim,

This is Elizabeth's friend from last Thursday.  I went out of town and this
is my first chance to say HI.  Had a good time the other night.  We should
all go have drinks again soon.  I hope your not AS down in the dumps.  Life
is too short for that.  Anyway, it was great meeting you.  Take Care.
