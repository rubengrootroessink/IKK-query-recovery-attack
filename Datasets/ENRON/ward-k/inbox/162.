Hey....I am sad...we will not come home until Christmas Day.  Will you back
after that?  I would love to spend some time with you!

How is Houston?  I know you liked it there before but had grown to love the
west.  Are you looking anywhere special for a job?...like Memphis?

Have you heard from any one who worked in the World Trade Center?  Of course,
I thought immediately of visiting your workplace there.  It was unbelievably
horrible!

Talk to you soon....I am so glad we are e-mailing!

Love ya,

Yonnie
