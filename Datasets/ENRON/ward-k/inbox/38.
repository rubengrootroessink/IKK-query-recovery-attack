Kim,
Thank you very much for forwarding the request.  I am the right person to send such requests to.  I will distribute them appropriately among the group here.  I have forwarded this particular request to Derrick and he is following up on it.
Again, thanks and I look forward to meeting you.
Regards,
David Hensel
