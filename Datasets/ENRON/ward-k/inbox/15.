Kim,Kim and Melissa,
The cost of your trip insurance was actually 49.00 each. They still refuse
to
refund it and the agent I just spoke with was very nice to see if they could
reaccomodate you in any way on the days you originally requested. She
cannot,
so suggests writing to customer service about the trip insurance refund.
This is who I
spoke with, however. I will get a name, address and phone number of someone
higher

I disagree with them.  We bought a particular product and they wanted to
change it by either 1) making us pay more money and spend more time flying
or 2) making us take two more vacation days that we don't have which = us
paying more money by not getting paid at work.  We loved that trip and
would still take what we originally agreed to.  I don't see how they can
subject us to penalties for something we had not originally agreed to.

Yes, They called this morning. They will refund all but the trip
cancellation insurance
which was 39.00 each. They said that you would have been in cancellation
penalties if you
did not have the insurance, that would have amounted to much more, so I
have
cancelled
it. I do not know how long it will be before it appears as a credit on your
card. It
depends on your billing cycle. It may take 2 cycles. Refunds normally take
longer than
charges, but they are in the process.
Regards,
Dee

Kim, I have left a message for my sales rep now. She is in Puerto Vallarta
with a
group, but will be back tomorrow. This may be where the supervisor is
,also.
I'll
call in a minute to see if I can get help elsewhere. I apologize for such a
delay.

Kim, I have left a message for the Customer Relations manager to call me.
When I got in this morning, they had
faxed me an alternate, using Delta for around 4600.00. I checked air only,
in case we could drop the air with
Continental Vacations, but it is between $960.00 and $1,000.00 each.
I'll let you know what happens when I speak with the mgr.
Dee
