Kim,

I am waiting on an answer from our legal dept.  They were making a minor change to the special provisions.  I will send to you as soon as I get the approval from them.

Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any
questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new
contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those,
please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things
rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.

Thanks,

Kim
