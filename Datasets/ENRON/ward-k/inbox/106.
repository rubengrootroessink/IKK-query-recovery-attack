Here is a little intro on those  confirmed.......
Brad Willmore (He'd rather be flying but his second love is  wine, oh no =
that's me.)
Liz Lowe (Outward Bound Babe - After scaling  rock wall's in Utah's =
Canyonlands, she could really use a drink! )
Lori  Mcleese (Cuban Cyclist Chic - out cycled Castro, with Mojito in  
hand)
Irene Kuster (Tuckus Extraordinaire - just ask a WINO ;)
Chris  McCann (The Airforce's Finest - but he can't talk about it, it's =
TOP  SECRET, shhhhh...)

needs to fill up the  wine cellar.)

  Subject: First Weekend in Alexander Valley - Marvolous  Merlot - Sunday =
November 4th 10:00 - 5:00
  Thought  everyone could use a day drinking wine and enjoying the =
scenery of the  Alexander Valley.
  Wanted to gauge the interest and availability of  friends interested in =
partaking in this winery event.  There will be  complimentary wine =
tasting and food provided at four vineyards in Alexander  Valley. =20
  Please see the attached website for details.  =20
  http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html 
   If there are enough people interested I was thinking of arranging the  
rental of a party van/shuttle bus for the day Sunday November 4th, from  
10:00 - 5:00 leaving from my house in the Marina.  After talking with  a =
few limo companies, the price per person for limo/shuttle service will  
probably be around $50 - $60 for the day.
  Please let me know  tomorrow if you are available and interested in =
participating.=20
   Please forward this email to others I may have missed on the list too!
   Thanks!
