Dear Friend, 
It is said that timing is everything. We particularly liked the timing of the September 7th USA TODAY front page of the Life Section.
USA TODAY has named Rancho La Puerta as the First of Ten Great Places to 
Balance Body and Soul. The article notes that "This health and fitness 
getaway favored by movers and shakers offers 'daily yoga and specialty 
yoga weeks'...and ...'is for people who want a taste of yoga but want to 
do more.' "
Upcoming Ranch yoga specialty weeks include:
October 6th - Yoga and Chi Kung presented by Mara Carrico
December 1st - Iyengar Yoga presented by Jennifer Fox & Phyllis Pilgrim
With blessings for your health and well being,

Holley, Isabelle, Heide, Sarah, Dawn, Veronica and Julia
