Subject: email address


In light of the recent events here at enron and the uncertainty
surrounding all of our employment, I would like each of you to have my
home email address so that you can keep in touch.  No matter what
happens, the work email address will change, whether I stay at Enron and
we are aquired or I change companies.  Who knows what will happen or
what the timing will be!  Donations can be made to - just kidding!  Hope
all is well with all of you!

Kim
