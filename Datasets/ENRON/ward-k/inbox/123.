Kim,

I represent a firm which has specialized in energy and power market
placement for over ten years.  I'm currently working with several
organizations across the country looking for energy traders, originators,
coordinators, analysts and schedulers.  These are great opportunities to
change location or better ones position quickly.  I'd like to schedule a ten
minute telephone conversation to discuss these positions and determine
whether or not you may have interest or may be able to assist with these
openings.

Please reply or call me at 630-990-7510 at your earliest convenience.  I
look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best Regards,
Todd Kubicki
