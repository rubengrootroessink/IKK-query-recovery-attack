Kim,

The FedEx package of contracts is going out tonight.  I've included:

Clarke County gas purchase agreement with APEA
SMUD gas purchase agreement with APEA
Enron gas supply agreement with APEA

I told Roger Mock that once we confirmed that the delivery point with SMUD and ensured that we were comfortable moving it, we'd let him know.  I also wanted to make sure that from the West Gas Desk's perspective, if we change the delivery point but leave quantity and term alone there would be no price differential to APEA?  Just keep me posted.
