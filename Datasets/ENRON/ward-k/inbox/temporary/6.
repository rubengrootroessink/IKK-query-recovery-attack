Kim, you are my top super star friend so I'm going to send this to you five times.  You have been the most helpful person I know during all of my moving tramas.  Thank you for picking me up at the airport and letting me stay at your place and driving me to work and keeping me out of the floods.  You are indeed a Rock Star!!!!!  Thank you for being so nice!
