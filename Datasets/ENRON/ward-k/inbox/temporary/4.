Kim,

Here is our sample GISB for your customer. Please note that the ENA GISB may only be used for firm deals for 30 days.  There is no such limit on interruptible deals.

Debra,

I am discussing potential short term transactions with a consultant for California Department of Water Resources.  They have requested a sample GISB document that would govern transactions for a term of one month to 12 months max.  Can you send me a sample GISB that we would use?  Let me know.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
