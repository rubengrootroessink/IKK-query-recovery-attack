Kim: 
        I'm checking into a  PG&E citygate basis differential for the 4-months Dec.thru March off the  NYMEX for United Cogen in San Franscisco.  Right now, the 4-month  strip is about $3.03/dth. Whoops, make that $3.26/dth.
 
    Also, I'm checking  into a price for a 38 months firm gas supply at the Citygate to run from  6/1/03-7/31/06.  The volume would be in the 5,000-5,500 dth/day  range.  Everything at United was put on hold following the 9/11  disaster.  If you have any  questions, give me a call.  Is now a good time to buy Enron stock?   Hope you're all doing well.
