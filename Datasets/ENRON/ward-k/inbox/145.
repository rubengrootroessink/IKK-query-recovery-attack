Sherry and Johnny Bains have put together a great package for the 31st at
the Tribute.  Time will be from 8:30 until 1:30 am.

Package details:

Valet service
2 blackjack tables manned by trained Vegas dealers
Special midnight countdown with champagne toast
Open Bar!!!
Two for 1 golf coupon at the Tribute (cost normally around 100 on weekends)
Menu to include (served between 9- 11:15 pm) Shrimp and Oysters with Caviar;
Smoked Salmon, Smoked whitefish; fresh asparagus;
                         Spicy beef mini sandwiches; goat cheese with
crackers; chef carved NY strip lion; filet of salmon with saffron risotto;
                          Supreme of chicken and sun dried tomato-cream
sauce; basil mashed potatoes and more.
Midnight Buffet will include black-eyed peas, mustard greens, corn bread, &
assorted French pastries.

Other items will be a DJ and his cost will be divided up later (maybe around
5 bucks)

Also available are suites if need to stay the night.  Need to reserve the
suite with the Tribute at 972-370-5465.

Price???   Well Sherry did a great job negotiating this one because the
Tribute wanted to charge 140 and that did not include gratuity.  (Over 160?)
               Price is 100 which includes taxes and gratuity (but not the
DJ or suite if you plan on staying)

Need to know soon by December 22nd.  Call Sherry at 972-370-1881 or e-mail
her at champersgal@aol.com.
