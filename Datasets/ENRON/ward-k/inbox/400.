Stacy -

With respect to Item 6 of Frito-Lay's Special Provisions, I propose that we modify that paragraph to read more like our ENFOLIO.  My suggestion is that we replace Frito-Lay's Item 6 with the attached.  Please review and contact Kim Ward as soon as possible with language acceptable to Legal.


Thanks,

JRW
