MJ,
How are you doing?  Things here are definitely  roller coaster status but
stablizing a bit!  How was your wine  tour?  I thought about you guys.
It looked like so much fun!   Elliot is thinking about having people come
to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I  was thinking about coming a day early or
leaving a day later (or maybe  both!)  I am thinking that you might be
out of town around there but  If you are around, I would like to get
together with you if it all works  out.  Let me know what you think!!
And I hope all is going well for  you!
Kim
