Folks,
          We have a problem with PG&E's natural gas meter #4, which is one
of the meters that records Palo Alto's hourly gas consumption. Looking at
historical data , it seems the problem started in early May 01 . Our
consumption at that meter dropped by approx 85% in May,  97% in Jun and 98%
in Jul, compared to the previous year. Our total metered consumption in
general has been lower this year for May(-22%), Jun(-11%) & Jul(-10%)
compared to last year.

    PG&E notified us of the problem last month and metioned that they were
going to take steps to fix it.I spoke with Frank Arroyo of PG&E regarding
back billing , when and how they
intend to fix the meter and below is his response.

As we discussed the natural gas flow through Palo Alto Station #4, located
at Searsville and Oak Road, appears to be much less than the designed
minimum capacity of the PG&E meter.  The current registered usage has also
been much less recently than in the past.  Apparently there has been
modifications to your distribution system that may be causing less load due
to a redundant supply from a different meter station.  Our Engineering
Department will call the Palo Alto Engineering Department to discuss options
to potentially modify the current metering station.  Based on the noted
natural gas flow through the meter when the meter station was evaluated, it
does not appear that we will be pursuing any corrective billing activities.
Although, we must reserve the right to initiate corrective billing should
the situation dictate.

Please call me if you have questions or if I can be of any assistance.

Frank
