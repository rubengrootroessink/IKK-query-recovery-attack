Hi Kim,

Yes.  Does this forecast account for the meter that is out?  The load data I
sent you last week for June 01 and July 01 is wrong.  One of the meters is
out and reflects zero usage for those months.  I believe you guys have
historical June and July usage for 1997 through 2000.  Let me know if you
need additional data.

We had talked about getting a forecast from you for months and months into
the future.

Also, I will fax you the baseload quantities for the month September 2001
this afternoon.

Call me if you have any questions.

Monica

questions.

Thanks,
