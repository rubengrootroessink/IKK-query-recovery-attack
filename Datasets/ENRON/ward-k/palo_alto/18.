Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our potential
natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and would
like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.

As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid daily
price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing market
warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in the
form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years of
daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information when
submitting your final proposal.

Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.

Regards,

Monica V. Padilla
