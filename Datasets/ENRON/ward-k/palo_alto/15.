Chris,
 Kim Ward asked me to forward this draft of the proposed Enfolio contract to 
you so that you could give it to her.  She said that she would send it to the 
city for its review.  The draft contains certain blanks which the city's 
counsel needs to provide.  Please call if you have any questions.
