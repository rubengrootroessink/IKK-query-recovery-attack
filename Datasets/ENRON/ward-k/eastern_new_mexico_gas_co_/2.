Kim:

Here is another one.  We have a deal with this muni - Eastern New Mexico Gas 
Company.  The price is Permian plus $05/MMBtu plus transport.  Deliveries are 
on TW.  The deal is expiring 4/30/01.  John Mattics is the contact 
(505/355-2468).  He called me yesterday to see if we were interested in 
extending the deal.  The desk likes the deal as it gives them some 
flexibility on TW (I am not sure exactly what the value is there, but I think 
Janie likes the deal).  Can you check with Tori or Janie and see if they want 
to extend the deal?  Is the price OK?  Also, what is your fax number....I 
will fax you the contract.

Chris
