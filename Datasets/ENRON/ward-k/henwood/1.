Kim:
    I appreciate  receiving the pricing updates from you last week for 5 yr. and 3 yr. gas  strips.  Henwood is working for several generation clients doing  gas/electric consulting, so I'll probably be contacting you again for an  indicative price, or you might receive an RFP for gas that we're helping a QF  write.
  
    One question that  I have now is, do you have an idea on what the premium would be for a 5 yr. gas  supply that was 5x13 or 5x16 rather than a base-load 7x24 at the PG&E  Citygate?   Thanks, Kim.
