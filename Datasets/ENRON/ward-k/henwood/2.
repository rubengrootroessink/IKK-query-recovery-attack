Kim: 
        It's been a little while  since I last spoke to you (about the call option), but I'm checking if you have  a refreshed price for a 39 months firm gas supply at the PG&E Citygate  to run from 6/1/03-8/31/06.  The volume would be at least 5,000  dth/day.  I'd also like to see the indicative prices of a "no-cost" collar  for this time period; for example, if I'm interested in a ceiling at  $5.00, would the floor price be $3.75/dth, $4.00/dth?  The call  options premiums were just too expensive.
 
    If you have any  questions, give me a call.  And thanks again for all your  help.
