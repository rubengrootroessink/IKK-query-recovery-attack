(Downey, CA)




CAPACITY FORUM

The need for expanded gas infrastructure, and in particular expanded gas 
pipeline transportation capacity, to serve the market in Southern California 
is an important subject that is receiving increasing attention.? SoCalGas 
believes it is an appropriate time to begin a dialog on this important issue, 
and to describe SoCalGas' view of the expansion options that exist on its 
system.

??????? To begin this process, SoCalGas will be conducting a Pipeline 
Capacity Forum on Wednesday, March 14th .? The forum will take place at 
SoCalGas' Energy Resource Center (ERC), located at? 9240 E. Firestone Blvd., 
Downey beginning at 1:00 P.M. and concluding at 4:00 P.M.? Refreshments? will 
be provided and the dress code will be business casual.? For a map to the 
ERC, visit our website below.

of this year and through next winter.
