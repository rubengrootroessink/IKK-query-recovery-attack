	Chris,

	Thank you for the information.

	We only have about 1 week to get a long-term energy and gas deal
signed.  Additional information I need to have reviewed by Hampton and
Houston are a copy of the guarantee and a copy of any another collateral or
credit terms that Enron will require.

	Hampton / Houston will need several days to review the terms.
Therefore, I need to get something to them as soon as possible.

	Please call to discuss.

	Rod

	Here is the gas price for PG&E City Gate:

	Up to 9,000 MMBtu/d, 5 years our of Aug. is $4.53, excluding PG&E
	          transport.  This deal has no take flexibility.  Kim Ward
on the
	          gas desk developed this number for me.

	The credit support for a deal like this would be something in the
	          neighborhood of a $20 million Waste Management Guaranty.

	Let me know if you need anything else.

	Chris
