CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

Chuck
