Kim,

I have attached a draft of a term sheet regarding the provision of gas procurement services to Riverside.  Can you look at this and help me with the pricing, terms, delivery, etc....

The RFP is due on the 20th; however, we have to get it buttoned up by Wednesday the 18th.  Hope this is not a problem.

 

Thanks,

Laird
