Kim,

We are responding to an RFP from the City of Riverside.  They are looking to install 40 MW of gas fired generation by January 1, 2002 (the actual installation date will probably be April 1, 2002) and require a gas supply.  Their expected capacity factor is only 15% however.  As such, they need a Gas Daily priced supply - up to 12,200 MMBtu/d - which they can call upon with short notice.

Can you provide me the pricing and terms under which ENA would provide this service?

1.  Can we deliver the gas to their plant-gate on SoCal's system?
2.  Would the gas be priced off Gas Daily at SoCal's border + as-billed transport to plant-gate?
3.  What notice period do we require to effect delivery?
4.  What index based price are we willing to do?  High end of the common range, etc...?

Have I missed anything?

The response is due April 18th.  Sorry for the short timeframe.

Laird
