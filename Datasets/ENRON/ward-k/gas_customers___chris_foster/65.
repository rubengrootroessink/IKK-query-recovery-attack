Kim:

thanks for passing this on.  For my info, what is the minimum volume your
group likes to work with.  We have other customers and I want to make sure I
include you in other sourcing events as they fit your profile.

Derek:

when do you think you can get back to me on this?  Can you email me your
contact information.  Look forward to working with you.

Best Regards,

Walter Rogers

Walter,

I was out sick most of the day yesterday.  Sorry.  These volumes are
really small for me to work with since I am on the Wholesale side of
Enron.  However, I have passed the information and your name on to Derek
Kelly who works with our retail customers out of the San Francisco
office.  If he is not able to help you - please let me know.

Thanks,

Kim
