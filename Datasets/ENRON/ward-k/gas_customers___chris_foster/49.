Kim, thank you so much for organizing the conference call last Friday, and
for taking part in our RFP process.  But based upon our meetings/call with
shortlisted suppliers, CalPeak has decided to proceed with other
supplier(s). I sincerely appreciate your participation in our process - it
was great to get to know you in person, especially since Jeff Fuller up in
our Bellevue office enjoys working with you.  I and others at CalPeak look
forward to continued opportunities to work with you and Enron in the future.
