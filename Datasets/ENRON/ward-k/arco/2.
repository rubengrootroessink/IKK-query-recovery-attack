Chris,
The refinery is potentially interested in a swap for Mid-C firm power, 20MW
block for:

1Q 2001

2001 full year

2001-2003 (3-year)

Can you provide an indicative quote for these periods?  Current price
levels
are forcing us to reevaluate our plans and targets for hedging.  'Not sure
how liquid the market is this week with all the news and price swings.  If
there isn't a market, that'd be useful information too....

Thanks,
-------Mark
