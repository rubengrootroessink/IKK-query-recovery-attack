Mary,

I have been unsuccessful at finding your phone number so I will try this 
email address I received from Kim Olinger.  I have recently moved from 
Enron's Portland office where I worked for Chris Foster, to Houston to 
re-initiate our gas marketing efforts in the west.  Chris has been turning 
over the gas responsibilities he retained after moving to Portland.  Could 
you change the Enron contact that you have in your system from Chris Foster 
to me?  My name is Kim Ward and my number is 713-853-0685.  Please call me 
with any questions you might have. 

Thanks,

Kim Ward
