I think it will have to sit with Smurfit in some way or  another.
I had just wanted to let you know what John had said.? I  would think you 
would require more of a procedure than what he  mentioned.
:-)
Have a wonderful night.? I have a date.
Lynn

Matt is the one who told me about this and he found out  about it from John.
Today, we were able to dodge Socal's penalties because  of some flexibility
that we have.? Matt is currently assessing the  situation with regards to
penalties tomarrow.? We can buy intra-day  gas but it will be at a big
premium - and a cost to us.? I think that  we will need to include language
in our March contract to the effect that  if Smurfit doesn't schedule with
us and use a volume that is within Socal's  imposed tolerance level, we will
be able to pass the associated costs back  to Smurfit.

HOw do you think this will sit with  Smurfit?

Kim

John

Talked to Kim Ward  at? Enron this afternoon to confirm pricing for rolling
the contract  forward. ? She expressed concern that there are specific
tolerances  that Enron has to abide? by or they will incur penalties. She
stated  that Enron contacted the LA? Vernon site today to see if you  were
running. They were told no, and she? said that later today that  changed
without notice to Enron.

This may have? been an  oversight today, but a concern when trying to move
forward with any?  marketer.
To eliminate the baseload requirements and Gas Daily  pricing? for swing
volumes, the plant has to be proactive in notifying  Enron of any
significant changes in usage. Otherwise, Enron will force the  penalties
back to SSCC.

Thank  you,
Lynn
