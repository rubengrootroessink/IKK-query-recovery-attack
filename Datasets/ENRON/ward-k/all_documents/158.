John

Talked to Kim Ward at  Enron this afternoon to confirm pricing for rolling 
the contract forward.?  She expressed concern that there are specific 
tolerances that Enron has to abide  by or they will incur penalties.? She 
stated that Enron contacted the LA  Vernon site today to see if you were 
running.? They were told no, and she  said that later today that changed 
without notice to Enron.

This may have  been an oversight today, but a concern when trying to move 
forward with any  marketer.? 
To eliminate the baseload requirements and Gas Daily pricing  for swing 
volumes, the plant has to be proactive in notifying Enron of any  significant 
changes in usage.? Otherwise, Enron will force the penalties  back to SSCC.

Thank you,
Lynn
