Kim:

Can you do this for Citizens?  Tom will be out of the office today, but back 
tomorrow, but please send the spreadsheet over to Tom today so we can be sure 
we understand each other on the arithmetic. 

Today's numbers will be indicative only.  He will call you tomorrow or later 
in the week at 713/853-0685 to see what the latest prices are and be in a 
position to give you a firm bid.  Tom's number is 520/226-2246.  Call me if 
you have any questions as to the format of the spreadsheet.

Thanks!

Chris
