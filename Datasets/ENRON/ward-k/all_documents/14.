It is important that you bring me a copy of your receipt for the gifts that 
you purchase for the tree in the lobby area.  We will tally all of the 
receipts and request matching fund from Enron.  Those funds will go directly 
to the Salvation Army.  

I am locking the gifts in a file cabinet for safe keeping, so please bring 
them to me.  Thanks for your support.  Teri
