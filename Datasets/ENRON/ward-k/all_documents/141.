Gentlemen:
In an earlier communication, I had asked Gelber to forward a summary
spreadsheet of Citizens' forward purchases position monthly before the 10th
of the following month.  To avert potential problems, I would request,
instead, that the summary spreadsheet be sent out on or before the last
trading day of the current month. Kindly copy Chris Foster at Enron on these
transmissions.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.
