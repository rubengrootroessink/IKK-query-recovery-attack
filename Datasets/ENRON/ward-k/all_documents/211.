Attached are the completed Exhibit A's that are required for the Kern Open 
Season.  The bid requires that a seperate Precedent Agreement (PA) be 
submitted with each Exhibit A, so that means your customers must sign two 
PA's and submit one Exhibit with each.  Also the credit worthiness and the 
affiliate statement must be submitted with each PA.  Instead of submitting 
all your affiliates you can instead submit the following statement:

 "Shipper warrants and represents that no other affiliate is participating in 
the open season"
