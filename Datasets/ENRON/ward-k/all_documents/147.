It was a billing error. We didn't bill them for enough back in early 2000 and 
then too much in Dec.  I don't think you need to worry about it unless they 
mention it to you.  If so, try to blame me and have them call me to explain.

Chris, 

I am assuming this is ok.  Why would they be invoiced for Feb - April now?  
Was this an error?

Have they called you with any questions and should I get back with them?

Kim

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  I 
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for 
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January 
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA 
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for 
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give them 
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel


PS I promise this is it.
