In that case, it's just the SoCalGas core procurement charge (including
brokerage fee -- e.g. their March price was $7.404/dth) that we need to be
comparable to or beat.  We have more control over the transmission rates so 
the
price from Enron we are looking for is just for the commodity at the border.
I'll provide you with our monthly WACOG that customers are charged as the
commodity portion of their bill versus SoCalGas' core procurement charge.  
I'll
be sending you the data today.
