Please take a gift card from the tree in the lobby and help us give our 
adopted family a very happy holiday!   I noticed some of the cards did not 
say sizes.  The mother wears size 10 in clothes and 6 1/2 in shoes.  Kassi 
wears a size 10 in girls' clothes and size 2 1/2 in shoes.  Josh wears a size 
10 in boys' clothes and a size 2 1/2 in shoes.
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                              
Also - Please raid your kitchen for extra cans of food or other 
non-perishable items.  If we each bring in three items, our family will be 
well fed this holiday season!  

This is also a great way to teach your children about giving.  Let them help 
with the shopping, or even donate part of their allowance to the cause.  

Thanks for your help in making this holiday season bright for people who are 
less fortunate than ourselves.

If you have questions about gifts, let me know.  Thanks.  Teri Whitcomb X
