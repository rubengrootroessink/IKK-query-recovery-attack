Let me know all about what materializes with your man hunt?????
Everyone needs a mate, I think.  It is nice to share with another person
who is kind and loving towards you and will be there through thick and
thin.
I know I wish I could see all of you in Houston, but that isn't in the
cards.  I just bet Robin and Katie will have a great time with the new
little girls.  I just love Molly and Liam and I now think I am a
grandmother by adoption.  Molly is growing so much.
I am still cleaning houses while Mel is back at work.  It is tough for
him as he still doesn't feel good.  I just handle one day at a time right
now.  Things have been better for us and I pray they will be that way
again.  One never knows what the good Lord has in store for us.
In June we are going to Sand Point, Idaho for a week with our daughter,
her husband and 8 year old grandson.  A working dude ranch.  Can you
believe that??  They have a lake with fish and nice golf course for Mel,
horses for those who want to ride all day, even a cattle drive, but for
me I just want to rest, read and not clean houses.
I am getting anxious for summer now.  Nice weather always brings out the
best in people.
Now that I have been so long wined and yakked your ear off I will go
clean my own house.
Love, Kathy
ps-  If you ever get back here on business or whatever and need a place
to lite my home is open to you.  I have 2 extra bedrooms that are ready
for visitors.  Guess I could open a Bed and Breaks fast!!!
