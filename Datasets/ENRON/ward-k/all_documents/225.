Kim,

Thanks for all your help today.  I apologize for my propensity to catch you
away from your desk.  We all have to be good at something, right?  Anyway,
here are the fixed-price volumes associated with a portion of the basis
transactions done in June and Q3.  I'm missing some deal numbers, but I'm
guessing you won't need those.

Deal Number  Month  Date  Volume Price

   June  12/28/2000 50,000 5.320
EU8529.X/67851 June  2/16/2001 50,000 5.530

   July  12/28/2000 50,000 5.340
EU8529.P/67851 July  1/19/2001 50,000 5.630

   August 12/28/2000 50,000 5.290

EU8529.G-L/67851 September 1/10/2001 60,000 6.020
QS5478.1/67851 September 2/16/2001 50,000 5.530


In other news, a few of us, including Art and I, are getting together for
drinks after work tomorrow if you or anyone else is interested.
Coincidentally, the State Bar is the location of choice, so I hope you
aren't State Bar-ed out.  Let us know.  I believe everyone will be swinging
by around 5 or so.

Thanks again,
