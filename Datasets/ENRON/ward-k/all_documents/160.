Wanted to follow up with yesterday's emails when you get in  this morning.
Let's address:
1)??? Pricing for rolling contract forward on a  month-to-month basis until 
changes are made to the way SoCal Edison purchases  power.
2)??? Pricing for contracting for all of the  other sites on an Index plus 
cost for a one year term and leaving the LA Vernon  site to roll 
month-to-month.
3)????What exactly are the penalties that  Enron is subject to should LA 
Vernon cause Enron to be out of balance for the  day?? What are the options 
we need to present to SSCC to address this issue  in a contract?
4) ??? The Irvine location.? When we first  spoke, Jason was involved with 
this location.? I had stated that I thought  they would be better off on 
tariff.? Due to the recent closing (December  2000) of the core program to 
customers with the exception of those whose  suppliers leave the market, this 
option is now not available.? Jason  mentioned doing a long term fixed deal.? 
This decision needs to be  addressed by SSCC corporate and the plant.? We 
will provide the costs to  SSCC corporate for this customer and decide on 
pricing from there.
5)??? Set up a conference call for the  beginning of next week with John 
Ewing at the LA Vernon site to discuss power  opportunities after August 2001.
?
Thanks, hope you had a great night anyway!
