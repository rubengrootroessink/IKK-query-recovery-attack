I wouldn't spend a bunch of time on them.  Originally, the guy calls me up 
and says...you know we are looking to put in a gas turbine cogen and would 
like to know if Enron is interested in working with us......the thing 
is....the oilfield can't really pay anything for the steam....are you 
interested?

Answer:   NO!!!

Yea thanks for the heads up Kimbo,

Black Hills wanted to get on EOL to look at pricing but apparently they can't 
get read only access like we can (they need to put up credit).  Anyway they 
got access through Enserco.

Did that Texaco lead we talked about ever get anywhere?  Let me know.

Jim,

Are you and or Steve Thome working with Black hills?  Should we work with EOL 
to get them online instead of rejected? 

Kim
