This note is in reference to our phone conversation  earlier today.? As a 
result of that conversation the following actions will  be taken:

Gelber will add to its deal tracking spreadsheet  a?column for Enron's 
transaction number and make sure the field is  maintained for all Enron 
transactions;
A copy of the deal tracking spreadsheet for  January 2001 will be sent to 
Enron;
Linking of Basis transactions with NYMEX  transactions will be done as 
follows for any particular transaction  month:

??? If fixed Basis volumes are less  than fixed NYMEX??volumes, Gelber will 
link Basis volumes to  an?equivalent?volume of fixed NYMEX gas;
??? If fixed Basis volumes  are?greater than fixed NYMEX volumes, all NYMEX 
transactions will be  linked to one or more?Basis transactions and the 
balance of Basis volumes  will be assumed to be linked to Index gas?
??? If there are no fixed NYMEX  transactions, any Basis transactions will be 
assumed linked to Index  gas.

Please contact me if any of this is unclear or you  have?issues.? Thanks.?
