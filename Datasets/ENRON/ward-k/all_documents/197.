Chris, Frank

Below the notes on the Phelps Dodge meeting of last week. Chris, I would like 
to discuss later today if possible. Frank, thanks for your input. You will be 
glad to hear that nothing much has changed there. If I didn't think PD was 
such a strong take-over candidate, I would be shorting their stock massively.

The meeting with Phelps Dodge to further discuss their energy/metals 
situation accomplished little. During the course of a 2 1/2 hour meeting with 
Bill Brack (Head of Engineering, and therefore of energy 
management/procurement) and Tim Summers plus Mike McElrath (two of his Energy 
Managers) the following points were covered:

PD will build two new power plants, one in cooperation with Duke and the 
other with BP Amoco. Both to be located in AZ, NM. Coal fired, ca 300 MW, gas 
fired ca 250 MW. They will enter long term contracts for power off-take from 
these power plants to meet their needs. Discussions with potential partners 
have been on-going since last summer. PD sees investment in power plants as 
the only answer to the power crunch. Gas has not yet been sourced. Enron not 
consulted back then due to our non-asset strategy. Details deliberately vague 
on their side.
PD's energy group is unable to discuss any transaction structures which 
involve copper plays. We have probed this to death, and Summers finally 
admitted that their board will not tolerate any suggestions that copper 
upside be "sacrificed" to secure lower/stable priced power. The clear problem 
they are experiencing--that energy price relative to copper price is killing 
them--is being addressed as an energy price problem only. There is interest 
but no mandate within PD's energy group to attempt to address the spread 
issue. 
Medium and long term energy risk management is limited to physical solutions. 
Financial and cross commodity solutions "would never be approved by the 
board".
PD continues to search for "5's and low 6's" on baseload power in a market 
showing 7's and 8's. They remain 100 MW short, which is driving their 
decision to curtail production. We put 5 year indicative low 6's on the table 
through a combination of clipped profiles and calls on copper (at 90 cts/lb) 
but the copper element in the structure sent them running.
After Brack left the room, Summers admitted that the energy group has done no 
deals directly with ENA since Enron almost won the beauty contest to be their 
energy partner two years ago, but included power procurement as an area of 
value add in our presentation to their board, against the wishes of their 
energy team. This clearly rubbed the energy guys the wrong way, and they 
haven't forgotten it--too close to home, clearly.  I can only conclude that 
PD's board would be in a much better position today had they taken Enron's 
advice then. 
A bit of insight (Frank, you'll enjoy this)--PD claims Enron offered "their 
ideas, sold back to them" and "no upside" in our final energy partner 
proposal to them two years ago. When I asked how their counter-proposal to 
Enron back then (identified projects first put to tender--if Enron is low 
bidder, Enron wins project) differed from free consulting, they had no answer.

Summary:
It is clear how PD got into their current energy fix. By admission of the 
energy group, nothing much has changed in the last few years there, either in 
terms of personnel or in terms of mandate. This, despite the fact that the 
viability of a number of PD facilities is in doubt due to energy 
mismanagement. Without top-down involvement, we will get no further with 
their energy team.

We are currently finalising the energy-copper structure we discussed during 
the meeting as I think it is the best option for them. I will also work 
further with Foster in Portland to give them the straight commodity offer. 
Perhaps this can serve as a focal point for future higher level discussions 
outside the sphere of PD's energy group. Joe/Michael-- I will make sure you 
get this, as Kalidas may yet have a role to play. It is unfortunate that the 
approach PD uses to manage their copper position seems much more 
sophisticated than their approach to energy. Results notwithstanding, the 
meeting was surprisingly open and candid on their part--no harm done to the 
metals part of the business.

Attached find quick-look results of our site analysis. Toured the Sierrita 
mine, no easy indication it will be closed end of this month. Personnel 
tight-lipped, though their head of environmental affairs lost little time in 
asking for a job. I have asked Bucky to keep you informed of developments in 
West Coast power, as I suspect their decision on facility closure (at least 
Sierrita) will be determined by power price developments between now and end 
March.
