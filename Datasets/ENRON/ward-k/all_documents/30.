Subject: smurfit stone

Tracy,

Smurfit is trying to do one of two things and maybe a combination of the 
two.  They want to buy Cal 01 & 02 (Mid-c) for $100 flat.  Right now, prices 
are about $144.  They are also considering shuting down their plant, similar 
to Kaiser, and selling us their power contract back for Cal 01- prices right 
now are about $170.  This would book out our previous sale to them for cal 
01.   I am not familiar with their contracts or credit.  If they do 
something, they might want to do it today.  What do I need to do to be 
prepared to transact. And how do I find out about their contracts?

Thanks for your help.

Kim
