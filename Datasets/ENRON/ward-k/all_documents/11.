Next wednesday at 8:00 AM there is a conference call with Houston about EOL.  
Basically Bob Schults wants to communicate the objectives of his group in 
getting new accounts and getting existing accounts more active.  I have 
talked with him about our frustration in coordination with his sales team 
George Hope and Dan Diamond.  The objective of the call is to figure out a 
way to communicate better and act as a team.
