You're welcome.  Actually, Jay's a great guy and asked me to work on it if I 
could because the terms were so "squirrly"...by the time you explain it to 
someone else, you might as well do the cws yourself ya know what I mean?!!!!

I'll be in H-town from the 19th thru 23rd.  Hey, Elliot and his gang are in 
Houston today by the way.

Hope all is well.  Behave at the bars when they all offer you free drinks.
