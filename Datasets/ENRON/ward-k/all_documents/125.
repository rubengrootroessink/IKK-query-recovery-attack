John:

Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It 
might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day 
to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a 
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant 
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?
