Lynn,

On Friday I spoke to Jan at operations, Chris  Foster and Accounting. Not one
of them was aware of the potential of us not  being supplied with natural gas
in April. Jan already had our volumes bid and  scheduled. It a good thing
this whole thing was cleared  up.

We are all set to roll April 2001 with Enron.? The  marketer is going
to call credit and give them an earful  today.
