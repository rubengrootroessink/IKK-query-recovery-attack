Kim-

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.

Calvin,

     Attached is a draft copy of our Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement.
Please let me know what I can do to help facilitate the process required to
get this in place.

Thanks,

Kim
