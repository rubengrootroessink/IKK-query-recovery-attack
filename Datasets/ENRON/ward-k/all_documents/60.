Good Morning,

Exciting News!!  We now have a new Portland Web based IT incident & tracking 
application to replace the existing Westdeskitissues.mde Access application.  
The new Web based solution adds several key enhancements that will hopefully 
improve IT response time and improve our communications back to you when 
problems are resolved.

Here are some of the key enhancments:
1.  Ability to query outstanding & resolved issues.
2.  IT problem/resolution knowledge base.
3.  Web page that displays important IT contact information.
4.  Automatic email notifications to resolution team members.
4.  And much, much, more.

For those of you who may be new to the office, or may have forgotten about 
the old Westitissues.mde application.  This application is continuously 
monitored by the production support team for infrastructure (PC's, Monitors, 
terminal-server, LAN, WAN, etc) and application (Enpower, Portcalc, CAPS, 
etc.) problems or enhancements requested by users.  This database is also 
summarized to capture metrics which are then used to evaluate the performance 
of the IT group.

Here are the steps to using the new West Desk Problem Tracking System:

New Login:

1. Go to http://westdesksupport/
2. Click the Login button towards the bottom of the page.
3. In the UserName Box, Enter:  ITWD.
4. For the Password type in: Password.
5. On the next Screen, fill out all the information. (Only certain fields are 
required, but filling out everything is preferable)
6. After Clicking the submit button, you are going to be asked to login with 
the new username and password you created in the New User Area.
7. Upon submitting, you will come to the main index page.

Adding a WorkOrder:

1. On the Main index page, click on the link add incident to log under the 
heading of West Desk Links.
2. Fill out as much information as possible. For IT Contact, please enter 
appropriate contact, or if you are not sure, select mtully.
3. Select Priority. (This may be changed by IT)
4. Submit form.

Note: For the description and response fields, you may use html tags for the 
formatting of text for display.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. If you hover your cursor over a link or 
picture or text box, a texttip will appear and tell you what that link or 
textbox is for.

Thanks,

Mike Tully

P.S. When entering a incident, there are two different types of "NEW 
Requests". One is New Request (Problem). This is used for reporting an error 
or problem with an application. The other is New Request (Enhancement) which 
is used for requesting an enhancement to an application.
