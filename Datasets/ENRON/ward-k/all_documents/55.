Although we will miss her greatly, both personally and professionally, we 
wish the best for Kim Ward who will be moving to Houston to be part of a new 
Gas Middle Marketing Group.  She will  be focusing on marketing physical and 
financial trading products to gas consumers in the Southwest and California.  
Kim was part of the first pioneering crew that moved to Portland to start-up 
our trading operation.  Her contributions have been tremendous.   Kim's last 
day in the Portland office will be Tuesday, December 19.
