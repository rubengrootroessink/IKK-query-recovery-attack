I pictured you as more of a democrat, I thought maybe you worked on some of
Gore's campaigns in Tennessee........

Dear Mr. Gore:

I am completely appalled at your behavior in all your "on behalf of the
people"
efforts.  The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized
process.  Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which
to
hand count and "further allow the people to have a voice".  The voice you
want
to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way,
you
learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on
copying
his character, sir).  But the genuine voice of the people has already been
heard.  And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being
overruled
by your political ploys.

I have always been so proud of America.  I've lived overseas for graduate
work
and travel frequently overseas for the work I do.  But now, sir, I am
ashamed.
You have shown complete lack of integrity and character.  You do not care,
sir,
about this country.  You clearly care much more about your obtaining this
office.  You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather
that
the right voices be heard and all others squelched.  I am ashamed of you
and
find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and
petulantly
fighting for and a disgrace to the nation.  Our America was built on
integrity,
character and honor.  You sir, have gutted that foundation.

Do you recall the phrase "God's Country" -- it still is, sir.  And you
someday
will have to discuss this with Him directly.  He also favors truth and
justice.
And I'm not sure your attorney's will be available to help you rewrite His
definitions quite as well as you've rewritten America's.

Mr. Gore, you are NOT a man to lead this country.  And you've proven that
so
very clearly in your actions over this election.  Shame on you, sir.

And that's "a voice of the people" for you
