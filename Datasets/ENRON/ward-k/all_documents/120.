Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted to  John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that Enron  and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price transactions to  hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively assisting Smurfit  Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing insight into market  fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators if you need.?  Give me a call with your
questions.

Thanks,

Kim  Ward
