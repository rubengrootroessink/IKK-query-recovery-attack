Kim, Patti, Suzanne, and Ted-
 
Again, my apologies for being late...
 
The total nomination for month of November 2001 is 10,500MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 4,033MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin(net, after PG&ENW losses 4,134MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day undertwo separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
 
Line loss on the PG & E line for November 2001 is 2.45%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.  However, we are looking into selling it and will notify you if we are successful.
 
We plan to take our largest steam unit (Broadway 3) off line on November 5th and replace it with Broadway 2.  Our actual usage will probably be about 3,500 to 5,000MMBtu per day, which is partly why we would like to sell off the APEA gas.  Actual usage will vary, of course, depending on the ISO.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve
