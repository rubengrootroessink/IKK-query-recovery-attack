Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-
 
The total nomination for month of September 2001 is 17,027MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 4,027MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses 4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
8  2,500MMBtu/day under a Q3 contract @ $8.925/MMBtu that we had forgotten about earlier...
 
 
Losses on the PG & E line have increased from August 2001 to 2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect, temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit (Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during the month.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve
