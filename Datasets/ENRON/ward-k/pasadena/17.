Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-

This is just a very slight revision to my erlier August Nominations e-mail.
If you look below the sum of the various contracts add up to
17,033MMBtu/day.  Thus, the total nomination for month of August 2001 is
17,033MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the
following:

1. 4,033MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,127MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of
1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
8  2,500MMBtu/day under a Q3 contract @ $8.925/MMBtu that we had forgotten
about earlier...


Losses on the PG & E line are unchanged from July 2001 at 2.27%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect,
temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit
(Broadway 3) is on line and a second one is on hot stand-by.

Sorry for the error.  If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve
