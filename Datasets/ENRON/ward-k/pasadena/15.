Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in all next week if we need to further tweak the language.
