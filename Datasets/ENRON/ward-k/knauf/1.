Jeff,

Attached are drafts of the agreements we need to execute to allow us to be in a position to transact.  Part of the input into these agreements are credit terms.  I am coordinating with our credit group to get those.

Given our respective processes, it is unlikely that we can execute a transaction this week.  However, once these agreements are in place we can, upon short notice, finalize a transaction.

Please have your attorney review these documents.  I will work on the credit terms.
