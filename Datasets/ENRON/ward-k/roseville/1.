Mike,

Sorry this has taken me so long!  Still trying to get access to some
programs with the good info!  Indicative prices for 5 year gas out of April
01 at the PG&E city gate is about $5.85 and 10 years out of April 01 is
about $5.12.  I hope this helps.  Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks,

Kim
