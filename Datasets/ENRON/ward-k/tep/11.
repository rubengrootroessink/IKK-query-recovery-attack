Kim,

I must await if credit wants new credit terms.  You may want to call Ed Sacks 
and ask such.

Once you or Ed get back with me, we in Legal will be more than happy to 
redraft and send to TEP.

Can we resend this?  I knew that we had done this before but it has been lost 
in the shuffle.  They will be waiting for it ready to comment as soon as they 
get it.

Let me know if there is a problem.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

Please be advised, an draft ISDA was sent to Dave Hutchens of TEP by FED EX 
on 5/11/2000.  To date ENA has never received any comments from TEP.

Ed,

Please advise if TEP's financial terms per your worksheet of 4/28/2000 can 
remain the same. If so Legal can provide TEP with a redraft.

Sara,

We are in the process of trying to lock in a fixed price for gas for Tucson 
Electric for the summer.  We need to get a contract in place ASAP that allows 
a financial transaction with these guys.  Have you guys ever looked into 
financial contracts with them?  Let me know what information you need or if 
you have any questions.  They are ready to do something today.  

Thanks,
