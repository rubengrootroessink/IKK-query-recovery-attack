We're getting on this for you...

Hey, hopefully the info below will help you with transitioning back to 
Houston with respect to the "go to" people in credit to help you on your 
deals.

Hotline (x3-1803)

GAS TEAM contacts:
-Jay Williams (manager)- supports mainly Fred Lagrasta's desk
-Russell Diamond- is the gas credit guy that takes care of the domestic 
portfolio and some of Canada gas
-Veronica Espinoza- works with Jay and Russell
-Brant Reves- support mainly Bridgeline
-Darren Vanek- new addition to the gas team

Your best bet for "instantaneous" credit answers would be to call the credit 
hotline.  You should probably ask for Russell Diamond to get domestic gas 
questions answered.  Then Jay Williams or Veronica Espinoza as back up.  
Russell Diamond was the one who worked on Sandia Resources from a WMBE gas 
perspective.

On the legal front, your physical gas paralegal is Debra Perlingiere.
The physical gas attorneys that come to mind are Dan Hyvl and Stacy Dickson.  
Their boss I believe is Jeff Hodge.

Hope this info helps you.  Take care.   Happy New Year's!  Did you party in 
Houston???  Where are you gonna live?  Found a place yet?  I'm looking into 
ski lessons at Meadows.

Take Care.  I'm pushing on Tuscon so will advise of an update shortlty.

Tracy

Tracy,

How were your holidays?  Any new year's fun?  I will be back in PDX next week 
and will be in the office for one day.  Now for work - can we PLEASE work on 
getting Tucson a new ISDA?  they have been ready to lock in summer gas prices 
for a month.  Let me know what I can do to help or if there is anything you 
need from them.

Thanks,

Kim

Ed/Wendy,

In May, ENA sent a draft ISDA to Tuscon for review and comments.  However, 
the cp had misplace the draft and is requesting a new draft.  Can you scrub a 
quick review on Tuscon, review the physical power ITM position, and propose 
terms for a new draft ISDA?

Ed-please have Wendy work with you on the re-review if needed.  Please 
forward the cws to Sara in swaps legal.

The cp is looking for a power swap this summer.

Thanks,
Tracy
