I have a customer that would like to be set up on Enron Online.  He is a 
wimby and under our contract with him, he will back to back each trade with 
public Service Company of colorado.  In other words, he doesn't have his own 
credit.  Could you set him up, at least with a temporary password?  His info 
is as follows:

Sandia Resources
Jerry Padilla
jerrypadilla@msn.com
303-332-9725

Let me know if you have any questions.  And please let me know when you send 
him a password.

Thanks,
