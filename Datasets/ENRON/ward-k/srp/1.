Just spoke with Mark Russell.  SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and credit.  I told Mark that I was available Wed. and Thurs. morning.  Are you guys available at the same time?

Jay - please call me with your bond rating info so that I can email a draft agreement to SRP.
