Market Summary (as of 11/20/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Market slips lower
Provided by MSN Money

Forget the bulls and bears. So far today, the blahs are in charge.
<P>
The Big 3 indexes have been in the red most of the morning, but all by less than 1% with relatively few shares changing hands.
<P>
So far, the much-anticipated run to Dow 10,000 -- so tantalizingly close after Monday's close, hasn't materialized. Perhaps a late-day run is in the works. Or perhaps the l-triptophan is kicking in a little early this Thanksgiving week.
