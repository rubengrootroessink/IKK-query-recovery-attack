Subject:	Hi!


Enjoyed meeting you last saturday nite.  I'm taking a guess at your e-mail
address here using what seems to be Enron protocol.  How many Suzanne Vann's
could there be at Enron?  I guess I'm about to find out when I see how women
show up for lunch!  Anyway, how does thurday or friday work for you?  We
could walk over to Bouray's or something if you're short on time, otherwise
I was thinking about driving over to Vincent's.  Let me know.
