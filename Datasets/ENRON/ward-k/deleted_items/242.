AGE]  Golf Quote of the week "No amount of eccentric implement will make a =
bad putter putt better." W.T. Linskill    [IMAGE]  Golf Trivia of the Week =
"The Stymie "  The stymie was really born by default. In the original rules=
 of 1744 only when balls were touching could one be lifted. A stymie could =
only happen in match play singles or foursomes. On the putting green, if tw=
o players' balls were more than six inches apart, there was no provision fo=
r the ball nearer the hole to be lifted. If that ball lay directly in the w=
ay to the hole of the ball to be played then the player was 'stymied.'  He =
could try to play around or over the interfering ball, but if the nearer ba=
ll was struck, no penalty ensued. However, the opponent had the option of p=
laying the ball as it lay or replacing it. If the nearer ball had been knoc=
ked into the hole the opponent was considered to have holed out with his pr=
evious stroke.   In 1984, Rule 22, Ball Interfering with or Assisting Play,=
 declared that a ball may be lifted if it may interfere with or assist anot=
her player in all forms of play, finally removing the last vestige of the s=
tymie after 240 years. The Leith Society.   [IMAGE]     Book at almost 1,00=

from Norwalk, CT asks: A couple of weeks ago in the PGA Championship, Phil =
Mickelson got ready to hit a shot out of the bunker (it may have been 12 or=
 13 and I can't remember now if it was Saturday or Sunday). He dug in prett=
y well (even the commentator on CBS noted it), was ready to hit, then he ba=
cked out, looked again at the pin and settled into his deep foot prints in =
the bunker. Shouldn't he have been assessed a one stroke penalty (Rule 13)?=
  I was taught a few rules in bunker play: 1) No practice swings 2) Cannot =
ground your club 3) Once you take your stance in the trap, you are addressi=
ng the ball. It is item 3 that would cause the penalty here (addressing his=
 ball).  Please explain why there was no penalty and how us amateurs should=
