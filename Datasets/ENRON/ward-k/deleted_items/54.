Market Summary (as of 10/23/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Good news lifts market
Provided by MSN Money

Tough to tell when the good news will outweigh the bad this earnings season, but that's exactly what it happening this morning.
<P>
Amid a stream of earnings reports good and bad, the Dow is holding on to gains of about 0.5% and the Nasdaq is up about 1.5%.
<P>
Investors lifted stocks early after DaimlerChrysler, Blockbuster, Pharmacia and AT&T Wireless all topped profit expectations -- or at least reported smaller-than-expected losses.
<P>
That seemed to impress investors more than disappointments from Exxon Mobil and Lucent Technologies.
