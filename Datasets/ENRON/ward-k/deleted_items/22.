Sermon 
>  
>A preacher became frustrated that a large part 
>of his  congregation was going water skiing on Sunday, 
>rather than coming to  church, so he told his wife, 
>"This Sunday, I'm going to preach about  the evils of 
>water skiing on Sunday." 
> 
>"What!" she  exclaimed. "That's a silly thing to 
>preach about!" 
> 
>"I  don't think so," he said, "It's a problem we need 
>to address."  
> 
>Next Sunday as they were driving to church, the wife  
>asks the preacher what he was going to preach about, 
>somewhat  warily. 
> 
>"As I told you," he said, "I'm going to preach about  
>the evils of water skiing on Sundays." 
> 
>"That's  idiotic!" the wife says. "First of all, it's a 
>dumb sermon topic, and  second, the people who need to 
>hear it won't be in church! Why don't  you preach about 
>sex or something people are interested in?" 
>  
>"Nope. The Lord wants me to preach about the evils of  
>water-skiing on Sundays, and that's what I'm preaching 
>about,"  he said firmly. 
> 
>The wife says, "Well, I'm not going to sit  through a 
>stupid sermon like that. I'm staying in the car. You  
>can tell the congregation I'm sick or  something." 
>And  she stayed in the car. 
> 
>As the preacher was walking from the  car to his study 
>at the church, he got to thinking maybe his wife was  
>right, and he changed his mind and gave a brilliant  
>extemporaneous sermon on sex in modern society. 
> 
>When  the service was over, one of the parishioners 
>stopped by the  preacher's car and said to the pastor's wife, 
> 
>"I'm sorry  you're not feeling well this morning. Your 
>husband gave the finest  sermon today that he's ever 
>given since coming to this parish."  
> 
>"I don't know why he thinks he's such an expert 
>on  the subject," the wife snapped. "He's only tried it 
>twice, and he fell  off both times!"
