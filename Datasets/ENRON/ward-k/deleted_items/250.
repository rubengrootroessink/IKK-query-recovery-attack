Yes, we will be having our Thanksgiving for the homeless this year.
Everybody is binging something so we end up with lots of extras.  Will be
playing volleyball, ping pong (table tennis), pool, golf, watching the ball
games, swimming in the hot 98-degree pool and maybe some nerf football.
Ought to be a good time.  john

I will be eating at sean doyle's and you are welcome.
Let me know if you have a get together so I can come
by.  My cell phone #512/468-4434.
