Market Summary (as of 11/26/2001 12:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Recession official, but stocks flat
Provided by MSN Money

<P>
So says the Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, which gets to decide such things. No real surprise on Wall Street, but enough to turn the Dow and S&P around and turn early gains into losses.
<P>
The Nasdaq, though, stayed positive, driven by tech and in particular chip stocks. And at midday, all three major indexes are within 1% of even.
