ORK, Nov 8, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- After announcing its  acquisition of th=
e groundbreaking KAT(SM) computer mouse,  Torbay Holdings, Inc. (OTC:BB,TRB=
Y), has received a favorable  response from the media and investing communi=
ty. Tom Large,  Torbay CEO, was recently interviewed for a CEOcast profile =
 http://www.ceocast.com ). Further, the company has been the  recipient of =
strong interest from a major New York investment  firm, with discussions co=
ntinuing.     The  KAT's medically conceived ergonomic design has been hail=
ed  as a breakthrough in computer mouse technology. It has been  proven in =
clinical studies to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome,  a common workplace i=
njury resulting from computer use. Given  that over half of all worker inju=
ry claims are related to  Repetitive Strain Syndrome, of which carpal tunne=
l syndrome  is a significant part, the implications for appreciably  reduci=
ng worker injury claims is significant.  CEO  Tom Large stated: "I am pleas=
ed with the response to  our announcement, as we are about to commence a ma=
jor promotional  campaign. If the reaction to date reflects future interest=
,  then Torbay should very quickly begin to see its full value  realized." =
 Outlets  for the manufacture and distribution of the KAT have been  establ=
ished in the US, Europe and the Far East, with official  production dates t=
