Market Summary (as of 10/25/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Tech leads market down
Provided by MSN Money

This was supposed to be a big day for technology companies. And it is turning into a big day on Wall Street, but a big day the wrong way.
<P>
The Dow is off more than 150 points, or 2%, and the Nasdaq off about 2.5%, at 11 a.m., while the technology indexes are getting hammered. The Amex Networking Index is off almost 4%, the key semiconductor index is off about the same and the Amex computer technology index is off 3%.
<P>
Most notably, Microsoft is down 2% this morning, just as the company releases its much-touted Windows XP operating system. (Microsoft is the parent of MSN Money.) The software has been widely praised, but will users rush in to pay $100 or more to upgrade to it? Investors, at least, don't seem to think so.
<P>
If there's doubt that software at a couple hundred bucks will move in this economy, there's even more about computers at a couple thousand.
<P>
Computer makers have also long been expecting a rush as users trade in their four and five-year-old systems for gadgets that will run XP. But makers like Compaq, Dell Computer and Gateway are all getting blasted this morning.
