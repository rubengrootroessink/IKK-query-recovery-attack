So, you're stressed out and over-worked as a result of these difficult
times, and you're thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to go on a spa vacation";
but your schedule doesn't really allow for the week-long trip you deserve.

Well, have you considered a spa-weekend, at a place within driving
distance from your home?

Good, because this issue of spafanatic covers spas that are easy drives
from major cities! The 'Great Escape' is closer than you thought. And if
the featured spas listed are not near your home town, then search for a
spa in your region by clicking on
http://spa-quest.com/spasearch or feel free to call us at 800-SPA-QUEST
(800-772-7837).

(If you would like to be removed from this list for any reason, simply
