Market Summary (as of 12/27/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

The rally rolls on
Provided by MSN Money

Stocks rose at the opening bell in very light trading as investors shook off a spate of bad news from around the globe: heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, deepening economic strife in Argentina, more depressing numbers from Japan. <P>
Among the best-performing sectors in early trading were specialty retailers, power generators, network builders and entertainment companies. Chip stocks rose, primarily on the back of a 5% gain in Advanced Micro Devices, reportedly in line for a big contract from Samsung.
<P>
Oil companies, pharmaceutical firms and beverage stocks suffered light selling.
<P>
A very similar setup welcomed Wednesday?s post-Christmas trading. Extremely light trading volume -- yesterday was the lightest yet this year -- tends to raise volatility.
