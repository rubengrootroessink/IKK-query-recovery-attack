Hey. How's it going? I've been going like crazy--I know you've been out of
town, too.  Anything going on tonight? I have allergies that are killing me,
but haven't been out in a while.

Rola called me and would like for us all to get together some night soon for
dinner--are you avail next week?

EJ
