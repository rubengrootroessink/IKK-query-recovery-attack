Market Summary (as of 10/26/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Bulls keep market rising
Provided by MSN Money

This time, the bulls didn't sleep in. Stocks slumped only momentarily this morning before showing into the black and seem poised to end an up-week with another positive day.
<P>
At midday, the Nasdaq sits about even but the Dow is up another 60 points and quickly closing in on its levels of Sept. 10 -- the day before the terrorist attacks that sent Wall Street and the economy into a tailspin.
<P>
If the Dow can cross 9,605, it will pass that level for the first time since the attacks.
<P>
One factor driving the rise: a good report on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, showing a slight uptick in the second half of October. It wasn't much, but a day after the market brushed off three bleak economic reports, it may have been enough to keep the rally going.
