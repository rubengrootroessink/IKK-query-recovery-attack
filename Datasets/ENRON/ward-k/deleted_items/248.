Dear Kimberly Ward,
I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the accident.
In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will communicate those results.
On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 
I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing across our system.
On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle, thanks for your support.
Sincerely, 
Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines
