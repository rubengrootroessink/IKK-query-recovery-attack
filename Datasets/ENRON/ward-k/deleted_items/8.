Market Summary (as of 10/18/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Markets lose early momentum
Provided by Briefing.com and MSN Money

Futures pointed to an opening rally, but stocks lost momentum just as the bell rang. Almost simultaneous with the opening bell came news of skin anthrax in an employee in the office of CBS News anchor Dan Rather. Bio-terrorism worries were the biggest reason for stocks' decline on Wednesday.

The torrent of mostly bad news continues: poor earnings, an anthrax-tainted letter in Kenya and another disappointing job-market report.

Already this morning, several more of the Dow 30 have issued their quarterly results. Investors like what they?re hearing from Coke. The company earned 43 cents a share, three cents ahead of forecasts, and says it?s selling more cans of soda at ever higher prices. Shares jumped 2% to 45.15.

The view at other Dow stalwarts is cloudier. Drug giant Merck  lived up to forecasts, but sales growth was weaker than expected; shares fell 2.4% to 67.42. No. 1 car maker General Motors  topped earnings forecasts after excluding special charges, but warned that discount prices and cheap loans to car buyers could hurt results again in the fourth quarter; shares dipped 1.3%. And McDonald's watched its earnings drop 1% from the year-ago quarter; its shares fell 1%.

Two other Dow reports are in the on-deck circle: Boeing any minute and MSN Money parent Microsoft after the closing bell.

<b>All earnings, all the time</b>

Six Dow members represent just the tip of today?s earnings iceberg. Literally hundreds of other companies, big and small, will issue their latest results by the time the sun sets. Find the profit forecasts in our earnings calendar.

Last night, two technology bellwethers in the microchip industry reported. Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments both exceeded profit estimates. But their comments on future business conditions were less than reassuring. (TI financial chief Bill Aylesworth said he can?t predict when his company will be profitable again.) Several analysts quickly lowered 2001 and 2002 earnings forecasts for both companies.

And Merrill Lynch topped earnings estimates but revealed a dismal ? though not unexpected -- sales performance in its brokerage unit. The No. 1 full-service broker is suffering low trading volume and a dismal stock market. It joined its peers in announcing job cuts, 2,300 of them, to be precise.
