Early surge gives way to caution
Provided by MSN Money

The markets are up but just barely this morning, as cautious investors await a flood of earnings news and expect most to be bad.
<P>
The market opened lower but rallied on good news from the semiconductor sector, with a report of cost-cutting plans at giant <B>Intel</B>. The stock was up about 3.5% this morning, and the key semiconductor sector index was up by about the same amount.
<P>
Investors also decided they like the numbers from 3M</B>, which reported a 21% decline in earnings this quarter, but also posted earnings of  $1.10 per share. 3M shares were trading up about 3%.
<P>
But there was plenty of bad news as well, and by noon EST, the surge had leveled off as the market awaited more earnings numbers this afternoon.
