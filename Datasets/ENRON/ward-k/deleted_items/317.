 near the top of the 10' bank of the newly restructured bunker. I knew appr=
oximately where the ball entered, but because of the new fluffy sand, there=
 was no obvious entry mark.  Questions: Am I allowed to probe in any way fo=
r the buried ball? Is it considered a lost ball, even though I know its loc=
ation within 2 feet? If I can't probe, and therefore can't locate the ball =
I know is THERE, what is the penalty and what are my options?    Click here=
