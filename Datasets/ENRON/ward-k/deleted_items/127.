[IMAGE]	 So, is EVERYTHING suddenly all about Michael? ESPN users are grabbing  Kevin Garnett  as the consensus # 1 pick.  Shaq  simultaneously gives you the best FG% and the worst FT% in the league. And it was Ray Allen  who was the highest rated Fantasy player last year. So we ask you...  Who would you rather have on YOUR team?   And that's the beauty of Fantasy Basketball . Just like the make-or-break dilemmas faced by owners, GMs and head coaches in the NBA, YOU make the tough decisions when building your FBA team.  But like that 40-foot heave with time running out, ESPN answers the call when you need them most -- supplying you with all the team-building tools of the trade for an upstart GM. So suddenly, it's all up to you .  	 [IMAGE]  ? Fantasy Basketball Index  ? 2002 Player Rankings  ? 2001 Final Player Ratings  ? Average Draft Picks  ? Most Added/Dropped  ?
