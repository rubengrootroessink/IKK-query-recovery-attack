Market Summary (as of 11/19/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Dow turns bullish
Provided by MSN Money

The Dow pushed its way into official bull market territory this morning, up some 20% from its recent lows, notes CNBC's Joe Kernen. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq tagged along, both climbing this morning. The story is similar overseas, with stocks in London, Hong Kong and Japan higher. <P>
The news this morning was only mildly positive, which apparently is all it takes for the market these days. October housing starts fell, but not as much as expected. Home improvement retailer Lowe's topped expectations. And two oil companies are merging. But the employment outlook remains lousy.
