I hope it was not because of me. I slept fine.  (Maybe you need some physical therapy!)  Anyway - trying to plan trips out west.  It is such a pain - I hate trying to get it all together to make it worthwhile.  If you ever want to IM me, my id on yahoo is kward63.  I hope you have a good day!

Good Morning!  How's the leg?  Do you have instant messenger of some kind?
