Market Summary (as of 11/21/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Market sinks into red
Provided by MSN Money

Go ahead, take off early.
<p>
That seems to be Wall Street's attitude today, even though the Thanksgiving holiday is a day away. In what promises to be a quiet session, the major indexes started the day down, despite a better-than-expected jobless claims report. That, and an uptick in consumer-sentiment numbers, lifted stocks -- but only briefly.
<p>
There is a bit of business to be taken care of, however, before we turn to gorging on turkey and sweet potatoes:  First, weekly jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week, Reuters reports.
<P>
In the week ended Nov. 17, new jobless claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 15,000 to 427,000. A Reuters' survey had forecast 461,000 jobless claims.
<P>
The second bit of business: Consumer sentiment rose in November, Reuters reports, as hopes for an economic recovery next year overshadowed worries about lost jobs and recession. The University of Michigan's index rose for a second straight month to 83.9 in November from 82.7 in October. That was higher than consensus forecasts.
