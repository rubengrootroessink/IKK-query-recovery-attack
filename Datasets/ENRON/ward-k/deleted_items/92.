Market Summary (as of 10/24/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Amazon pounded but market flat
Provided by MSN Money

Amazon is taking a beating today after an unconvincing earnings report, but so far it isn?t taking the market down with it.
<P>
At midday, the Dow is off less than a half-percent after spending most of the morning on the other side of zero. The Nasdaq is up by a fraction, and only real market direction is nowhere fast.
<P>
That?s not true of stocks releasing earnings numbers, who seem to be following those numbers up and down.
<P>
Amazon is off more than 20% after posting a loss that was pretty much as expected. The company again promised profitability, but Wall Street looked at slowing sales and wasn't convinced.
<P>
Sears, meanwhile, saw shares rise (though only a bit) after reporting a rise in profits and announcing plans to restructure and cut 22% of its workforce.
