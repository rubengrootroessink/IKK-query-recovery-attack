Dave,

I think I mentioned this to you before, but I will also need the following attached to the ISDA:

1) duly executed tax forms ro certificates
2) evidence of authority to execute Master Agreement
3) specimen signatures (as to signatories to Master Agreement
4) financials
5) resolution to authorize execution of:  a)master agreement by specified parties and b)  all transactions under the master agreement
6) copy of  Articles of Incorporation
7) bylaws

ENA must provide the same documents to you.  You can ask Sara (pronounced Sora) questions regarding these documents once we get her on the phone.

Call me.

Kim
