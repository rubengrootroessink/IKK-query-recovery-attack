I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  

Thanks for your help!

Kim

Of course I remember you.........did you get the fax I sent yesterday?
Actually looking forward to taking you sailing on my boat!  We usually try
to gather a group and go for the day/evening and stop at the boardwalk after

for chips/margarita's at Cadillac Bar.  Yes, place I charter though does all

the lessons - ASA certified - can get you info or you can pick it up
when we go out on my boat too.

Have a great trip/weekend..........lets talk next week and catch up!

Regards,

Doug

Hey Doug,

How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch
base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds
really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to
doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway,
can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you
are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any
recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when
I get back.

Have a great weekend,

Kim Ward
