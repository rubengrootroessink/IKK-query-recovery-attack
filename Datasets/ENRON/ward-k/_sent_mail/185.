Suz - here are the details -

Arrive in PHX Wednesday, April 11 @ 7:30 p.m.  Take a taxi to the Cottonwood resort  which is $199.00/night with two double beds and I think a fold out couch.  Suites with a hot tub on a private patio.  Lots of wine drinking.  No real going out but dinner at the Terra Cotta Restaurant one night.  Lots of spa treatments and sunbathing, and magazine reading.  VERY relaxing.

We leave sunday at 1:30 pm.

Call me and let me know if you want to go!!

Kim
