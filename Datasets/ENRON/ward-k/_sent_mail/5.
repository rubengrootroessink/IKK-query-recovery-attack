And who told you what I do when I am in Scottsdale??  Palo Alto is in Cali - Have you ever heard of Stanford University?  What do you do in Moab?  My friend Harriet was in Vail this past weekend and said it was snowing like crazy.  I don't know - maybe a second date is in order - just for kicks.  when are you coming back to houston?

Moab is in the southeastern part of Utah.  I burned my feet at lake Powell which is also in Utah.  So no second date with your new boyfriend?
By the way I heard that the spa isn't only what, or should I say who, you visit when you go to Phoenix.  Where is Palo Alto, AZ?
