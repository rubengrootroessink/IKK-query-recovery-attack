Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
