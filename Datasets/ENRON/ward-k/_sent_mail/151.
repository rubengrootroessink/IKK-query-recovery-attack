I don't know if we want to do business with someone so unwilling to share information or provide guarantees.  Do you get any comfort from the information that you have seen or recieved?  Let me know what your opinion is.

Thanks,

Kim

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

Chuck
