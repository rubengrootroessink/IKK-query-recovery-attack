Laird,

You can get prices from me any time - but you know I am always up for wine!!  Anyway, notional prices for Q4 at PG&E City gate are $11.65, 2 years out of  Jan., 2002 are $6.75, and 5 years out of Jan 2002 are $5.80.

Let me know if you need to do anything. 

Also, what is your take on providing gas to all of these power plant developers.  I get at least one call per day from a different developer.  I am thinking that some of them will get built - for the state - but I can't determine who is worthy.  I have been short listed on PRMs RFP for Calpeak power, a sub of United Technologies.  They have no transport across Socal's or PG&E's systems (and neither do we) and United Technologies won't guarantee them 100%.  They said that they would provide "credit mechanisms built into the projects".  I asked what these mechanisms were and said that we take cash.  I haven't heard back!! Ha.

Kim,

I need your help.

Knauff is looking for fixed, notional prices @ PG&E city-gate as follows:

1.  Q4 2001
2.  2 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/03
3.  5 years:  Jan 1/02 - Dec/06

They use 60,000 MMBtu per month or about 2,000 MMBtu/d.

Can you help me?  I owe you and I expect that the only thing I've got of value is wine.

Laird
