The expense should have shown up on my hotel receipt and was authorized and approved by my boss.  This expense should be reimbursed.

David

The only reason why a gym expense form would not be authorised, is if there was no prove of payment. (receipt).  If you do have a receipt for the gym expenses please send the form directly to me and I will authorise the form immediately.

Thanks

Abu

Abu,

I have just rec'd back from HR an expense form for Kim Ward claiming back gym membership expenses.  All there is on the sheet is a tick indicating 'not authorised'.  Perhaps more information from you would help us solve the issue as I have absolutely nothing to work on?
