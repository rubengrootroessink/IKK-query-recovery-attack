Sara,

Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?
