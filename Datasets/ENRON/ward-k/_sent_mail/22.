	One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper,
young Prince that I am and then, my sweet, we can marry and setup
housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother, where you can prepare my meals,
clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy
doing so.

	That night, while enjoying lightly saut?ed frog legs seasoned in a
white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled to herself and thought:  I
don't fucking think so.
