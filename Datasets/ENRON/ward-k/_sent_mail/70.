Arnold,

I must have been looking at the wrong index or report.  I have now gotten access to Natural Gas Intelligent's web-site so I can give very fast and accurate prices.  I am sorry for the confusion and hope that I didn't cause a lot of trouble.  Just so you know, april was $12.56 plus the $.05 premium.

Let me know if you need anything else. 

Thanks,

Kimi

Kim,

We rec'd your March invoice which reflects a price of $12.63 not $12.38 as
quoted below? Please advise if you will re-invoice for the correct price.

Kim,

It is that time again. We do this 4 times/year. I need to get a cost
forecast by month from you for natural gas through the end of this year.
California Border.

p.s. I know it is early but is our price for March available yet?


thanks,                  Arnold Paxton
