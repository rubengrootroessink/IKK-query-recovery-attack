I did make it home - and I managed to catch an airplane at 8:00 the next morning, have two meetings, attend a reception, and go to dinner.  Needless to say, I was very tired by the time I got home on Friday night!!  It was a fun week for me too - I got to see people that I hadn't seen in four years.  As for the weather, you aren't missing anything here this week - cold and rainy - just like portland!

Let me know when you're around - margaritas on a patio is always fun

Kim
