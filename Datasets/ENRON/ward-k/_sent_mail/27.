I actually have plans on Tuesday, and then Wednesday on I am in Florida for a training class.  What about the week after that?  I am taking care of the munchkin it is getting bigger every day.  On the 1st we find out the sex, I cannot wait!

Take care and I let me know about the week after next.

Susan
