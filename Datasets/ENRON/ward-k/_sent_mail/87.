Miss Sloney,

When are you coming to Phoenix?  Suzanne gets in at 11:00 p.m. on Friday night and leaves sunday at 1:15.  I leave here wednesday at 6:40 on Southwest from hobby and get there at about 7:25.  I leave sunday at 10:20 a.m. ( I couldn't get a good fair when I bought my ticket for a later time.)  

Let me know what's going on - I hope you can go hike camel back mountain with us!

Kimmie
