we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by far
the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you
checking any bags?

That would be cool - I get in at 5:59 pm on United from San Jose.  So how
was napa?  I think that I need a napa trip sometime this year.  How was the
place you stayed and where did you eat.  Did you buy any good wines?  What
was your favorite?

What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
is out of luck and on his own!
