Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

Kim
