  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]  Tuesday, April 10, 2001           Dear continental.com=
 customer,    We're Changing To Serve You Better This Thursday evening Apri=
l 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our web reservations system,=
 eService Online.  This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the=
 reservations platform is 100% provided by Continental.  We're making this =
change because our current product, while good, will not provide us with th=
e flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arr=
anging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.   He=
re's What You Need To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, includi=
ng your username (KWARD1) and password, has been transferred to the new ver=
sion of eService Online.  To protect your personal information, credit card=
 information has not been transferred.  You will need to update your profil=
e.  Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April =
12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you wi=
ll need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not af=
fect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not v=
iew them in the new eService Online.    Signing In To enhance security, you=
 will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase =
flights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have=
 your password e-mailed to you  click here .  You are strongly encouraged t=
o sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold =
Option To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the "H=
old for 24 hours" option.  The "Hold" option will not be available between =
April 10 and April 12.   Here Are Some of the Changes  More eTicketing The =
new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (e=
Tickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by N=
orthwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airli=
nes (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages fo=
r easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled E=
lite-status available seating.   Pricing  The pricing system is enhanced to=
 deliver more current fares based on your selection of either "Search By Lo=
west Fares" or "Search By Schedule."  We also added a gold star to denote "=
continental.com promotional fares," so you know for certain when you receiv=
e a discounted, online-only airfare.   Customer Service  Our customer servi=
ce is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all supp=
ort for online inquiries and reservations services.   While we've made a nu=
mber of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, o=
n the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These changes lay the=
 foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  W=
e welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedbac=
k from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.  Overall, we'r=
e confident that you will appreciate the changes and improvements and look =
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.  Sincerely, Continental A=
irlines Inc.   This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e=
-mail as a registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in =
service.  If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscri=
be please reply to: eservice@coair.com   This E-mail was sent to: kward@ect=
