Monica,

Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  I pulled these off of our curves and adjusted them for today's price movements.  If you would like to transact, we will have to get more refined prices approved by the desk, which shouldn't take too long.  

Just let me know - 

Thanks,

Kim
