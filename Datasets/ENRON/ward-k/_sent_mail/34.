Thanks for the email!  Sorry you can't make it to the party but you guys will have to come by some other time!!  I do like being back in houston!  There are things I miss about portland but I am happy to be back.  Lets do go to lunch - maybe next tuesday?  Let me know what you think!  Tell Patrick hello - and take care of that munchkin!!
