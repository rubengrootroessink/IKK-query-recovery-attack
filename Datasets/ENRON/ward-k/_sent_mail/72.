I found a good place - Bay Area Sailing.  When you have time, go to their website - www.bayareasailing.com and let me know what you think.

I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.

I will keep you posted -
