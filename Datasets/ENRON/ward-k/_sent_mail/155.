It's that time again... crawfish are in season and NESA/HEA is geared up to
make sure you enjoy your fill on Tuesday, April 17th!  Held again at
Woodrow's located at 3111 Chimney Rock, the fun will start at 5:00 p.m. and
continues until 8:00 p.m.!

$15 in advance covers all the crawfish, jambalaya and beer or margaritas
you
can hold - or pay $20 at the door.  Either way, drop a business card in the
bowl when you register and participate in a drawing for an Astros vs.
Braves
game to be played in late April (courtesy of Michael Roberts, Shell
Trading)!
