Ola - 

Hope your vacation was good!  Barry and I are planning a trip to Tucson and will tentatively be flying in from California the morning of April 27th to meet with you.  Just wanted to send you the email so that we can talk about it as soon as you get back.  We are waiting on you to buy our tickets.  Let me know.
