Jay,

Please call me when you get a chance. I have a list of customers that we use to serve out of our Socal pool that we want back.  However, we need to establish credit.  and then maybe some contracts.  Can I do < 1 year with these guys without a master ?  Maybe use the GTC?

I need to make some $ so WE can go to Pebble beach.

Kim
