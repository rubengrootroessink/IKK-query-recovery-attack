That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.

Thank you so much! That is quite useful information.

Question relevant to longer-term quotes...are those cash-flow year
"settlement" prices (in other words, if a deal was done today for on-peak
power in the year 2011, would an invoice in the year 2011 be settled at
$61/mwh, or would that price somehow need to be adjusted to reflect
inflation).

Eric,

Attached is a spreadsheet with the price indications you asked for.  I hope
it is helpful.  Let me know if there is anything else you need.

Thanks,

Kim

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

Thanks!
