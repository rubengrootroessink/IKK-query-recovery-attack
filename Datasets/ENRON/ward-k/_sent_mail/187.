Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim
