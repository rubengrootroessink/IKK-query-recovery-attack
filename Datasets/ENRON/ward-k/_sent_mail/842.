thanks for your help as always.  i think we might try the auberge place.  if
you ever decide to get out of the energy business i think you have a place
as a travel consultant.  You need a break?  you were just in scottsdale.
how drunk was kevin mcmahan that night, i was worried he was going to follow
you up to your room.  i have seen him drunk, but nothing like that....

I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some
GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the
wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are
little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY
recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and
great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @
www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been
recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous
of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -
