Dave,

Sorry I am just now responding - I have been very busy and lost this email but found it today.  I am in houston working my tushy off and trying to get moved into my house.  My new numbers are 713-853-0685 (w) and 713-412-4571 (c) and 713-526-7117 (h).  How are things with you? your job?  did you guys end up moving - I can't remember.

Hope all is well - and I will do better about responding to emails!

Kim
