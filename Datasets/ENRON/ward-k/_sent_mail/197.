Dan,

Thanks for looking at this for me.  Could you recommend something not so awkward?  Sat, Sun & Mon would be the price published on Tuesday.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,
	The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Dan,

Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so that we are legally comfortable with it?

Thanks,

Kim
