Sorry for not leaving a message - I just thought that maybe you would get an email faster.  We ended up leaving Downing a little after midnight.  Not too much later than you.  My weekend was OK.  I am tired of working on my house!  Anyway - went to the baseball game yesterday.  It was nice to be  out in the sun.  Hope your weekend was good.  And now that you have my number - you will have to be the brave one!

Kim

Ms. Ward, what no message on the voice mail? I really think it is kind of
cute that you were chicken to leave a message. Modern technology.  I guess I
will have to be the brave one and pick up the phone. I hope your weekend was
fun. What time did you and your friend from California leave Downing? Look
forward from hearing from you soon...Stanton
