MJ,

How are you?  It was good to see you when I was out there.  Things here are busy as ever!  I have some guy friends going to napa valley in a couple of weeks and they would like a recommendation for a place to stay.  I know you have stayed in napa before - do you have any recommendations?  I appreciate your travel agency services!!

I hope all is well and to see you soon.

Thanks,

Kim
