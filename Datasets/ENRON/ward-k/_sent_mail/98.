Called the number you gave me about 7:40 PM but it was your pager not your cell phone. (713-415-4571)
I figured you were pretty tired and just sleeping, which was the best thing for you anyway.
I went over to the Kinder Morgan party.  

You missed a great weekend.
Saturday was a little cool up at the lake, but Sunday was fantastic.

I hope you feel better before your trip to the spa.
Don't work so much!

	Jim
