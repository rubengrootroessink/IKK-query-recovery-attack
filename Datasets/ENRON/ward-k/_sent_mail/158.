J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

Thanks,

Kim

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Chuck
