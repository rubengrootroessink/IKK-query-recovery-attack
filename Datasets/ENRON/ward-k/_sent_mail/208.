Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August, 2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.   

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50 bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim
