That would be cool - I get in at 5:59 pm on United from San Jose.  So how was napa?  I think that I need a napa trip sometime this year.  How was the place you stayed and where did you eat.  Did you buy any good wines?  What was your favorite?

What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
is out of luck and on his own!
