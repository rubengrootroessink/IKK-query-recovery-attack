Sorry I am just now replying - busy afternoon and I'm trying to get out for the baseball game.  My roulette number is 10.  I don't know how lucky it is, but it would be the number I would pick.

Have fun in vegas -

See ya,
Kim

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

	Jim
