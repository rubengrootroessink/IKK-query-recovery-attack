Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One Enron" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don
