Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim
