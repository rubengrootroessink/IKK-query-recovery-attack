Hi Jeff,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Kim Ward
