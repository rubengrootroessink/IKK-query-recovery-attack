Willis,

I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.

Thanks,

Kim
