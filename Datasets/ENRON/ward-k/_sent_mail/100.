i'm still here. we'll have to wait and see to see how it affects us. we have
our own credit rating, so technically it should not affect us. but it's the
perception more than anything when your name is attached to pg&e. i'll keep
you posted. are you ready for easter ? do you guys have off friday. i'm
coming home on friday. it's going to be one of those church weekends. church
friday and saturday night. then dinner at my moms on sunday.
