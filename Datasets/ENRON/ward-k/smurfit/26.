I have been working with Ron on this power agreement for the Vernon facility in Los Angeles that is also the entity that is buying gas from us through Kim Ward.  We have not reached agreement on this Scheduling Coordinator arrangement, but are trying to clarify our proposal.

I told Ron that our gas deal was with Smurfit Stone as are our Montanan Power deal and the L/C.  Ron indicated that Smurfit Stone cannot enter into these types of transactions.  Can you please help me by contacting the appropriate individuals at Smurfit   and try to clarify the credit picture.

Thanks

Chris
