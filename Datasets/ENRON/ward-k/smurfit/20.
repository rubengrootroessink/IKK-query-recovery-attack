(Sent to both Enron Energy Services and Enron North America)
 
Please find attached a Request for Proposal for several Summit  Energy clients in California.
The first client is Smurfit Stone Container Corporation  (SSCC), served behind PG&E.  The largest site in this group is the  Santa Clara mill site.  This site owns Redwood capacity.  We are  interested in a supplier that can offer to manage that capacity in an effective  manner.  
 
As you know, the SSCC contract has already been sent to your  office.   Please work directly with Michael Dickson in our office here  to go over any issues with the Smurfit contract.  He has direct contact  with legal at SSCC corporate.  He is available at 502-429-3800 ext  111.  
 
In the past, we received a marked up SSCC contract back from  Enron.  We would like to try and work through reasonable requests for  changes to the contract and come up with a mutually agreeable deal.  Keep  in mind, if you choose to bid on Smurfit in this proposal, that we request that  your pricing reflect (Bid One) the terms and conditions in the SSCC base  agreement (including the payment terms).
 
For the remaining Summit Energy clients, the bid process  should be fairly straightforward.  SGL Carbon (SoCal Gas) and Borden  (PG&E) have agreed to basically the same base agreement.  We  have attached those terms and conditions for your review.
 
Newell Rubbermaid (SoCal Gas) and Libbey (SoCal Gas) are  willing to work with the marketer agreement.  Summit Energy will review  your agreement and request any changes we deem necessary.
 
We look forward to hearing back from you.  All proposals  are due in by close of business Monday, May 21.  Thanks in advance!   
 
Please call me with any questions regarding the  RFP.
