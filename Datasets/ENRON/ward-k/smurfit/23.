Kim,

I'm so sorry it took this long to get back to you.

The below deals are all the deals we have with Smurfit, and the system shows that all the deals are under GTC's and do not require the cpty to sign, so all the deals have been executed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Ellen

Ellen,

Since Richard is out, could you possibly help me with something when you have time?   Can you check on the monthly confirms for sales to Smurfit and let me know what we've gotten back from them and what is still out standing?

Call me if you have any quesitons.

Thanks!

Kim
