Kim: 
    Thanks for sending the contract to us.  I have forwarded it to Noresco's attorney.  We will be back to you for refreshed pricing tomorrow or the next day.  If you plan to be out of the office let me know the best way to reach you.
                                                                                                                Regards,
                                                                                                                Phil Glaessner
