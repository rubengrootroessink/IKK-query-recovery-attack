Of course you can use me as a ref.  And good luck.  I think Barry and I are coming to AZ the 28 - 29.  I know we will be coming to your office so hopefully I will get to see you.  Be sure to bring pictures of Abri!

All is well in Phoenix...except the heat, but that's the usual gripe.  Glad
to hear you are not under water.  Thought you were leaving the extreme rain
behind when you left Portland.  Oh yeah....those darn tropical storms.  Hey
I might use you as a reference if that is okay.  I am flying to Dallas next
week for an interview.  They haven't asked for any yet, but I would like to
okay it with you in case they do.

I am lucky as I unknowingly bought a house on a little hill with great
drainage!!  My street flooded but it didn't make it up to my house.  Water
did get in the house behind me.  But all is well and everyone I know is ok.
Only a couple of car fatalities that I know of - thanks for checking!  How
are you?
