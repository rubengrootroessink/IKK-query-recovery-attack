Hey Kim!! I wish I could join you guys in January too!!! I definitely would
if I wasn't going in December!! I've had trouble adjusting to the "real
world" too. My productivity is quite low...to say the least!! Anyway, I can
send you a new invitation. I just need to know which e-mail address you want
me to send it to. Just let me know and I'll send it right out!! Take care
and keep in touch! Linda

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to
admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never
able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the
invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that
would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.
I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you
could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2
