No problem - I have a 9:00 mtg. but will reprice right after that.  

Thanks,
Kelli

Kelli,

When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?  Still an indication.  They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.  They are leaning towards this blend though.

thanks for your help,

Kim
