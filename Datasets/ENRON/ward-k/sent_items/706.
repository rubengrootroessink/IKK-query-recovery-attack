Hi Joan - yes it is me, your long lost cousin!  You probobly got my address off of something that my mom sent around.  How are things with you?  As you probobly knew, I am back in Houston - which is very good as my company just announced a merger on Friday.  Worried about many of my friends but I am not so worried about loosing my job.  The world is certainly in turmoil!  Hope all is well with you and your family.  Keep in touch -

Kim

I know that Kim Ward is a common name, but as I was  scanning the addresses of mail forwarded to me, your name was on the list.   Are you the Kim Ward native of Memphis and  daughter of Jerry? If so, this is Joan-reply.  If not, trash  this.
