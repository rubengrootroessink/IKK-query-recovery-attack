Rob, 

I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  

I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac! 

Kim

Kim, 

How's the hiring climate over in Barry's world?  The future here in broadband obviously is bleak.  I'm trying to generate job leads at a company that is quickly shrinking.  Not an enviable position.  

Attached is a resume.  Any inquiries on my behalf are appreciated. As for added comments to hiring people: although I've spent my entire 2 1/2 year Enron career at EBS, I've been in trading, structuring, and origination roles the entire time. I can model and sell w/ the best of them.  I also know Jean Mrha and Tom Gros well. (If that's worth anything.)

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks

-Rob
