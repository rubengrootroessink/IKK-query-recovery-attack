Good morning Kim, 
You mentioned yesterday that Enron had some EP capacity to sell.  Well,  
Citizens is wanting to know if Enron could make firm sales to it for gas to  
its electric generating facility, Valencia, located in Nogales, AZ.  As I  
recall the gas requirements are in the range of 1 to 2 MMcf per day.   
I have the following questions which I would like to discuss with you on this  
subject: 
1) Is there sufficient available capacity on the pipeline that will allow the  
gas to flow? 
2) Could you make deliveries for the month of August and possibly September? 
3) What would be the delivered price? 
4) What is the expectation of this gas showing up everyday? 
Give me a call on my cell phone to discuss> 
Best regards, 
John
