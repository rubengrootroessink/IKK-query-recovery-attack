Art,

We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -

1)  Is this physical or financial
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?

Thanks,

Kim

ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying to work around some meetings etc.

Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin? 
Thanks 
Art Avalos
