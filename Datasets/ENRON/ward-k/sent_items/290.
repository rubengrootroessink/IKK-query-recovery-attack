Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
