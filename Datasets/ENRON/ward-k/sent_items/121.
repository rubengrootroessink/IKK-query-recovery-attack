I know - I am so inconsiderate!  But, if you want, I will promise NEVER to do it again.  

Just a little tired today- thanks goodness for the opportunity to sleep late yesterday.  How about yourself?

I usually get here between 7:30 and 8.  Today - exactly 8 o'clock!  Not much going on in the market today - I might finally go get my car tags and driver's license - but I've been saying that for 5 months now!

You must stop keeping me out late!  How are you feeling this am?  What time do you come in?
