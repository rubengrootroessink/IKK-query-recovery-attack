Craig,

If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it. 

Thanks,

Kim

Would you do a favor for me?  Were you able to (or can you now) open the attached Excel spreadsheet and read it?  When I send spreadsheets to Darla she can't open them.  She said they appear as a .dtf file extension and are unusable.  I've sent attached spreadsheets to people at more than a half dozen different companies and haven't had anyone else say they can't open them.  So I'm wondering if someone else at ENRON can open it.
Thanks, 
-Craig

Kim, 
Could you take a look at Charlie's list and get back to me?  I really appreciate it. 
Thanks, 
-Craig

Here is what Charlie Sanchez sent.  He said we purchased 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29 and a total of 240,000 fixed price NYMEX.  He said it looks like you missed the purchase from 12/28/00 and it seems like you only show 100,000 of the 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29.  Ask Kim what she thinks.
