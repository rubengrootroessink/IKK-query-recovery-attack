Hello again, 

Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal, Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California.  It is my understanding that the ISDA itself has been executed and required attachments are in the process of being gathered.  Therefore, you will soon have the option of transacting with Enron financially.   We are available to meet with you at any time on October 11th.  Please let me know if and when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

Again, we look forward to meeting with you and exploring new opportunities.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination
