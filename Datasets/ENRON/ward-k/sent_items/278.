Craig,

I agree with Charlie.  I wasn't here until January so I was not aware of the Dec. 28 deal.  I think that when we do August, my information should be complete.  Sorry for all of the inconveniences.  Thanks for your help.

Kim

p.s.  I will tell Darla.

Kim, 
Could you take a look at Charlie's list and get back to me?  I really appreciate it. 
Thanks,

Here is what Charlie Sanchez sent.  He said we purchased 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29 and a total of 240,000 fixed price NYMEX.  He said it looks like you missed the purchase from 12/28/00 and it seems like you only show 100,000 of the 170,000 worth of fixed basis at -$.29.  Ask Kim what she thinks.
