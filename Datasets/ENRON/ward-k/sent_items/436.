Darla is ready to bill citizens for Sept.  I guess we can use Cogans sheet if we are comfortable it is correct.  Let me know if you need anything and when you think we can get this to Darla.  ]

Thanks,

Kim

Hi Kim,

I am ready to invoice Citizens for September.  Do you have the Griffith sheet ready yet?

Thanks
Darla

I am back in the office - we are having a conference call this afternoon to iron out the last calculation questions and you will get a final spreadsheet for August and September from Mara Bronstein.  I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.  Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?  What do you guys need in order to pay them?

Thanks,
Kim

Hi,  

Just wanted to get an update from you on the Citizens info I asked you about last week.  I am wondering about the payment to John Cogan for Aug production and the EAMR payment due.  Did you talk to Sarabeth about that?


Thanks
Darla
