Kim:

	I just spoke with Larry.  We are on for the above mentioned meeting.
I tried to call you several times, but for some reason you couldn't hear me.
You answered once and your office answered 3 times.  It seemed that you and
your office could not hear me.  I tested my phone on a local number and it
worked.
