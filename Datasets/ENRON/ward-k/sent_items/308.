Mike,

I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)

Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.

Kim
