Terri, 

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit - but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet - thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.  Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim
