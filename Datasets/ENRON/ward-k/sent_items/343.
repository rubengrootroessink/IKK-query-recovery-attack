Phil,

Attached is a draft Natural Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement.  My apologies for taking so much time.  I hope it is not too late.  Please call me with any questions and if we need to, I can get credit on the phone.

Thanks,

 Kim, here is your draft for Noresco. Call me if you have any questions. I realize the name is wrong on the file I will change this, it is correct in the contract.
