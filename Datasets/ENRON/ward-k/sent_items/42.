Thanks,

Kim

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does not take it out on us in the furture.

Frank

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?
