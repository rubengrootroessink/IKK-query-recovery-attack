Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.  I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2
