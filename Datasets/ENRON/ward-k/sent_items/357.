VERY Cool!  I will keep you posted on the structure that we are focusing on.  Right now it is Nymex + physcial basis.  They will lock in basis but not Nymex.  We can talk about the potential risks there if you want.

I believe he is the correct person to talk to, but if not, he can point you
in the right direction.
