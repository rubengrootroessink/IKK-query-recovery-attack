Ann,

I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:

1400 Smith Street, EB3206a
Houston, TX  77002

Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
