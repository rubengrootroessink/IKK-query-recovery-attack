Hey,  just heard from the girls that you are now a tv star.  They saw you on some E! Entertainment special.  I am sorry to say that I missed it!  How are you and where are you?  I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.  Hope you are enjoying yourself.  I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.  It was a lot of fun!

If the show runs again and I am able to see it, perhaps I will record it for you!  Have fun and keep in touch!
