I have been wondering all week whether you got on the boat.  I looked at continental's specials and their weren't any for this weekend.  But if you plan ahead or are flexible on flight times, you can definitely get here for less than $200!

HOw was the rest of your trip?  Anything exciting to report?  How was your time with Turbo?  

I wish it were last wednesday!  I think I am going to sell all of my belongings and live on a beach somewhere!!

Let me know what's going on!
