Hello everyone,

I got an email yesterday from Jack confirming our meeting on Monday at 2
p.m.  In light of the recent tragic events and the chaotic state that
the commercial airline industry is in, Barry and I will not be traveling
to California next week.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may
have caused.  We do plan to come out to California to see you guys at a
later date.  Once things have settled down and we are able to
re-schedule, we will be in touch.

Steve, I am working with Legal to have executable documents sent to you
and will keep you posted.  Thanks again for your patience.

Please call me if any of you need anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
