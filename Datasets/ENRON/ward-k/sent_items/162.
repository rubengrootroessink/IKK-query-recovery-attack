what kind of breakdown?  when did I ever have a breakdown?  A mini mid-life crisis maybe (hence the belly ring).  Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.  Theresa just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.  I had to break the bad news!  When Lisa and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!

So what is going on the weekend Barry is making us go up to Denver?  Should I come in on Sat - since I can't go to NYC for the US open!!

I knew it!  Houston, like Las Vegas, has all the trophy women!  What's up with you?  Everything going ok, or are you in the mist of your latest breakdown?
