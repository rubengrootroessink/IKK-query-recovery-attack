The index prices are fine and may actually be lower.  I will check with my desk.  The fixed prices are only for one year.  Five year fixed price indications for Malin are $4.12 and for PG&E city Gate are $4.77.  Let me know if you need any thing else.


Thanks,

Kim

	The term needs to be for five years.  Are the prices listed for one
year or five years?
