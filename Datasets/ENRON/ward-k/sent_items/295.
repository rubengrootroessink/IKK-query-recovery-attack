Also, what is the location for the original swap, and how much orig do you want on the extend piece?

Thanks!

Kelli,

I sold a swap to Merced for 2,040/d that goes through Feb 03 for $7.85.  Can we look at a blend & extend that starts Jan. 02 and we would extend our deal out to Dec. 05?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
