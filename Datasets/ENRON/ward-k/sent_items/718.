el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?

Kim

Thx

I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules!

We should definitely invite Rosie, but she has to promise to stay out of my parents' bedroom!

El,
I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details!
Thanks for the invite - 

K.
