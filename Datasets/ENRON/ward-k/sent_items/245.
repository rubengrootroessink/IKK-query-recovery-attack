Funny - I get an email from you and Keith Aaron on the same day!  Not much going on - just settling down and staying home a while since I traveled non-stop June and July.  I have planned to go to Aruba in October (16th - 20) and then to St. Martin etal in January.Come to Aruba and bring friends.  We are staying at the Allegra Resort all-inclusive.  But we are somewhat boring - sun, san, surf, and a few suds.

Let me know what else is going on!  Oh, yeah - my home email address is kward1@houston.rr.com.  My boss is nosy and reads my emails!

Take Care,

Kimmie

What's going on?  I had a minute and wanted to say hello.  What interesting
travel plans do you have in the near future?  If it is anything fun, kidnap
me and take me with you.  I need a serious break!  Just wanted to say HI!
