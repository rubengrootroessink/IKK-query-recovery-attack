Subject:	Susie's father

Hello all, 

	I am sorry to send this bad news.  Yesterday Susie's father had a massive coranary.  I took Susie home around 2:00 yesterday so that she could pack and take off to Louisianna.  It is my understanding as of right now that he is/was brain dead and they were going to pull the plug yesterday.  I am going to get the information and send flowers.  Do any of you want in?  Please let me know.  Thanks all, I hope to be the bearer of good news next time.  Stacey
