Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW
Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw
Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw

Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.

Thanks,

Kim
