Absorutely.  WO Right after work unless I knock it out at lunch.  

Side note:  Sometime this weekend I want to go to the galleria and talk to a watch shop about changing out the face on my Heuer.  Will you cruise the mall with me?

Don't forget to go out to eat tonight!!! This is very cool - you can check the merchants that participate.  Most are pledging 100% of proceeds, some like Carrabba's are pledging 100% of sales - it's a fun, easy way to help out!
