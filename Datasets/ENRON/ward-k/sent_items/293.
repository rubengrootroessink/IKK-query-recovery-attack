Stacy,

I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.  I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?

Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kim
