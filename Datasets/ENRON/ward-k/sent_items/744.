Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not =
much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a=
 change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think t=
hat there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that par=
t.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice. =
 Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suza=
nne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with C=
orporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay o=
n with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this w=
ay, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES=
 gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Than=
ksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip=
 - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse =
to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out wi=
th myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?=
  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the ho=
liday season and time for (good) cheer!

Kim

Big Bosses are calling this a merger of equals but we won't really know for

look like a big change for the floor except picking up more production (mos=

of Phillips volumes with Duke EFS).

What is going on over there?  Glad to hear you have been given some
assurance.  What about Suzanne?

Are you going home for T/Giving?

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
by
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
your
listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
an
option on one more.
