Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan, and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about $.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.  The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim
