MJ,

How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!

Kim
