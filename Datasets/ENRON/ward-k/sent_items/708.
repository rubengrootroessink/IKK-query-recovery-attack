Hey!  The leg is healing nicely, thank you.  It did turn a little blue but I think I will live!  I say we are serious about the party but I have forwarded this to Suzanne to make sure she is on board.  I will keep you posted as things develop!  Hope to see you again soon -

Kim

I really enjoyed meeting you on Saturday.  Let me know if you and Suzanne
are serious about the VOLS/Gators party.  I would love to help!
I hope your leg is doing ok!

Terri
