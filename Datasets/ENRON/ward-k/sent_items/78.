I think it was the version Dan used to prepare the confirmation.  Do you need it?

Sounds great.  We can review the term sheet.  Do you have the latest version?

Chris,
I have arranged for Janie and Patti to be available for a conference call at 11:30 CDT, 9:30 PDT.  I will get Patti and Janie on the phone and then call you.  Let me know if you have a conflict.

Thanks,

Kim
