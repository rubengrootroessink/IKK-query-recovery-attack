Dan,

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=
ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  =
The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=
der.

Thanks,

Kim

=09I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,=
 please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signatur=
e by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available=
 to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of i=
ncumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a=
 fully executed contract for your files.
=09Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers =
of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  =
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your=
 transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for gi=
ving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for i=
ts actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if=
 Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto an=
d Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notific=
ation, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.=
  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their r=
eceipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes. =
   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  the OF=
O provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I can=
 verify with the transport group.
