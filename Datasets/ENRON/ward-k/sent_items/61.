Lou, 

Attached is the RFP response we discussed.  Enron has the capability of offering an array of risk management products.  We are unable to provide gas to you at Malin as we do not own firm transportation on the Redwood line.  Please call me with any questions that you might have.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
