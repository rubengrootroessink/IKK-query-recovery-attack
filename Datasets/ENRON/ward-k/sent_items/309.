Sara,

I am in Denver at an offsite but will be back in the office tomarrow.  Glendale left me a message on Friday that they are ready for an executable ISDA agreement.  I left you a message earlier but wanted to make sure you got it.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  My cell phone number is 713-412-4571.

Thanks,

Kim
