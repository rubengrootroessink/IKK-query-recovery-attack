Christopher J -

We missed you for sure!  It was a fun time.  I was glad to see everyone.  Nothing exciting took place - just a little dancing and visiting.  All went home at midnight.  Boy have we become boring in our old age!

Take care and keep in touch!

Kimberly Susan

Kim,  how was Sat. night?  I didn't get finished at the Redbirds game until
10:30.  I couldn't have showered, changed and arrived before 11:45.  Didn't
think there was much of a chance anything was still going on at that time.
Hope all went well.  Bring me up to speed as to what went on.  Look forward
to hearing from you.
