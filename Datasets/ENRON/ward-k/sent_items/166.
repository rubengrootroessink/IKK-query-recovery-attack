Guys,

I am trying to set up a conference call with Steve Snyder, (etal) of HESCO to determine once and for all if we can do business with them, what it will take to do business with them, and what kind of business we can do with them.  If we can't do business with them, we need to say so with an explanation.  How does Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 sound?  Let me know ASAP so I can set it up.


Thanks,

Kim
