I am available next week.  I would love to get together.  Tonight, an old friend is coming by the house for a drink around 6.   I would love for you to join us.  He is married and will probobly have to go home.  Don't know what's going on after.  Pete and I broke up last night.  Very sad.  Call me if you get a chance 713-853-0685

Hey. How's it going? I've been going like crazy--I know you've been out of
town, too.  Anything going on tonight? I have allergies that are killing me,
but haven't been out in a while.

Rola called me and would like for us all to get together some night soon for
dinner--are you avail next week?
