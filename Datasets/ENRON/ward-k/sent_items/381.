Art,

The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.  For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.

Thanks,

Kim

This is for physical gas for a monthly call at the money. 
The Balloon Fest schedule is Oct 10th (Wednesday evening) 
through noon Friday (Oct. 12th).

Art, 
We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions - 
1)  Is this physical or financial 
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call 
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of 
the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be? 
Thanks, 
Kim 
ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying 
to work around some meetings etc.

Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin? 
Thanks 
Art Avalos
