Mr. Dossett,

I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!

And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win? 

Kim

John Schilke emailed the invitation to me for the TN/FL game; however, I did
not get the invite from you, meanie.

I do hope you guys have a good time (I can't go to Houston this weekend),
and I hope the Vols can keep it close for more than 5 minutes.  Did you see
that the point spread is already up to 18?

Write me.

Kane
