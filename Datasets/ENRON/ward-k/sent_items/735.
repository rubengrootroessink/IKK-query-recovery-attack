Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -

Kim

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of

with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
by
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
your
listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
an
option on one more.
