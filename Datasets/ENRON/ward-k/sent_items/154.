Friday or Saturday sound good to me.  If there's stuff to do on the island,
let's go Friday, do stuff on Saturday, and sun on Sunday before we board.

Opinions, thoughts, ideas???.......

     The islands of visitation are as follows:

     St. Barts
     Anguilla
     Nevis
     St.Kitts

     Windjammer will give a discount at the following hotels:

     Captain Olivers total of $210.00 /night per room not person with free
     breakfast (assuming continental breakfast)
     Great Bay Beach Resort total of $290.00 / night per room not person no
     breakfast

     These hotels can be seen on www.wheretostay.com

     After deposit on Monday the total final payment due on Nov 8th is
     $1,055.00 and if we include air it will be $ 1,939.73

     We do not have to book air now.  We can actually wait til Dec if we
     want
     however the airfare is not guaranteed at $884.73.  The flights to St.
     Maarten are not as long so it looks like we would be in at about 2:30
     ish.

     If you have any questions please ask me I will try to find out and
     pass
     it onto everyone.

     See ya!  Stacey
