Hi David,

I got your name from Don Black as the replacement for Roger Ponce.  I am on the West Gas Origination desk for ENA in Houston and often run across customers looking for gas supply, particularly in California, that would be considered retail customers.  I am forwarding a request I received this morning that EES might be interested in.  I will continue to forward such information to you unless you let me know you are not the person I should be contacting.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

I'm sorry.  This is GAS rather than electricity.  Thanks.
