We did have fun - Camille was interested in the other Chris and wouldn't leave - I think we were loaded too. 

 Sorry for flirting a little too much - I don't know if you told Stanton that I hit on you until 5 in the morning or if he just read that into your story - but it drove him crazy. He called my house at 2:30 am Sunday morning very drunk and being very wierd!  

Anyway, it was a great party - thanks for the invitation.  Until next time -

Kim

rude or obnoxious, but regardless it was good seeing you and meeting your
friend.
