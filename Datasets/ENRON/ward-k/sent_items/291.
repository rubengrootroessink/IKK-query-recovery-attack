Yeah, I pretty much need brakes.  Just do not want to spend $100 just bc I misplaced a set!

Should know about the runoffs by tomorrow.

I think you need brakes!  Especially if you plan on winning lots of races!  So are you telling me that your car doesn't have all of its brakes?  Have you found out if you are going to the race you might have enough points to go to yet? (I can't remember what it is called - sorry)

I cannot believe you ate the leftovers.  I had them on the brain last night!

Hard work on the car is done, except that I have misplaced a set of brake pads which is driving me nuts.  I'm not sure I even need brakes....hmm.   :-)

Hey - my Monday was good, too.  I have a truck load of stuff to take to goodwill - and a lot more work to do!  It is amazing how much junk I own!  I want to get rid of it all! How's the car?  Ready to race?  Went back to Suzanne's for left overs and a movie.  We watched "The Gift".  It was really creepy!
