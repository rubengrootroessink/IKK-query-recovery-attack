Chris,

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

Kim Ward
