The weekend was VERY good!  But - the weekend is the past.  Who knows what the future brings!   Even so - in your searching, you might find someone better than me!  But, if I am still unattached, I will be there!

Kim,

I don't know how well your weekend was, but do I need to be looking for a new back-up?  That is, when I am 50 and single, will you still be there?
