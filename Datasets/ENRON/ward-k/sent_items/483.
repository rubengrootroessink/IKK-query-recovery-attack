Jack,

Thanks so much for the message.  You are right, we are still a great trading organization.  Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.  As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.  I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.  Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.

Thanks again for your email -

Kim

Hi Kim,

Just wanted to say, well I don't really know what to say.  For what its
worth, you guys are the sharpest group of traders and one of the most
innovative companies I have ever dealt with.  You'll find a way through
this.

If you need to reschedule our meeting Tuesday evening I completely
understand.

Thanks,
