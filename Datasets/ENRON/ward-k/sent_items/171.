This is about credit working with HESCO right ?  IF so then we should know what ENA credit (Jason) is planning to discuss with HESCO, so I do feel that we should have that conversation with Jason prior to bringing anyone in.

Jason is available at 3:30 and I agree we should get together before - do you want Jason involved?  We could meet at 3:30 and bring Hesco in at 4:00.  Let me know your thoughts.

thanks,

Kim

Kim, looks like 4:00.  That is fine with me.  We should have some internal time before we get on a call with HESCO.

Could each of you confirm if you are available for a conference call with HESCO today at 3:30 p.m.?  If you are, I will set up a room and let you know where.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
