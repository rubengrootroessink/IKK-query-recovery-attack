Hey guys - it looks like NCPA got our proposal and would like for us to refresh by 9 am PPT tomarrow morning.  That is 11 our time.  Jay, where are we with credit and contracts.  I think we need to have this done today.  Can you let me know what our status is?  Barry is asking me.  Kelli, can we refresh in the morning fairly quickly?  I would love to get this deal done.  Tomarrow, we need to add a little orig!  Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

thanks, 

Kim
