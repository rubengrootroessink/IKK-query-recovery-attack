Debra,

I am discussing potential short term transactions with a consultant for California Department of Water Resources.  They have requested a sample GISB document that would govern transactions for a term of one month to 12 months max.  Can you send me a sample GISB that we would use?  Let me know.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
