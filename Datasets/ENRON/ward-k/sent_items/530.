Yonnie,

I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!

We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!

Talk to you later -

Love,  Kim

Hey....I am sad...we will not come home until Christmas Day.  Will you back
after that?  I would love to spend some time with you!

How is Houston?  I know you liked it there before but had grown to love the
west.  Are you looking anywhere special for a job?...like Memphis?

Have you heard from any one who worked in the World Trade Center?  Of course,
I thought immediately of visiting your workplace there.  It was unbelievably
horrible!

Talk to you soon....I am so glad we are e-mailing!

Love ya,

Yonnie
