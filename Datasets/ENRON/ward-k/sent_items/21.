Would the contract be with Citizens or Gelber?  I have tried numerous times in the past to get an ISDA with Citizens but their corporate leaders have always been hesitant to enter into derivative transactions.

Hey Chris,

I don't know what these gelber guys have in mind but I thought You might be interested.  I have been working on an ISDA for about 3 weeks.  what do you think they want to do with power?  Call me when you have a minute and let me know if you want to be involved.

Kim

Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.
 
Sincerely,
 
Art Gelber
