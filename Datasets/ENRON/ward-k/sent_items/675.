Hello.  sorry I missed you last night ( and Saturday night!)  That football game I watched had 7 (a record) Overtimes!  The game lasted until about 10:30 and my team lost.  Very sad.  JDA and I went to Berryhill to meet Matt last night and I thought you would be there.  Is everything OK with you?  

K.
