Hey!  Glad to hear you are well.  I have thought about our days on the 92nd floor as well.  Had some acquaintances that worked for Cantor as well as a close friend who worked for them that was called back to Houston for a meeting that very morning. Very glad he is with us today!  

It is cool that you hired Palmore.  You will have to tell him hello for me.  I did come back to Houston in January.  Enron brought me back to peddle gas in the West US.  Nothing much new in my life, just a new house and job - but I am glad to be back.  I miss the outdoor life in Portland but the people here are so much more fun and nice!  If you are ever in town - you better have a beer with me!  I will let you know if I am in Dallas -
Take care,

Kim

Hey Kim,
I just received that email about Halloween, pretty scary!
You won't believe this, but I just flew in from NY City.  My partner and I had to go there on business. I thought to myself several times over the past few weeks that you, Melissa and I worked in that building.  I wonder how many people just like you and I were lost and what that has meant to their families and friends.
So it looks like you moved to Houston. (Your email reply address had Houston in it.)  I hope everything is going well.  Is there any news in your life?
There is anotherstrangecoincidence.  I hired Palmore.  He starts Monday.  He'll bring a lot of experience with him to help us with some financial projects and operational improvements.
Let me know if you ever come to Dallas.  It would be nice to see you.
Wayne
