Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day but have moved back up.

Thanks,

Kim
