Steve,

Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone.
Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.

Thanks,

Kim
