Janette,

We are offered at $2.69 for San Juan gas for August.  The adders for scheduling are the same.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need.  Sorry for the delay but I think we've gotten everything straightened out here.  The trader just had a computer issue.  '

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,
I will discuss the Guaranty form with Vito and pass it along to the people
that will need to handle this issue.

We do need updated pricing - I left a message on your voice mail about 15
minutes ago.  A reply by e-mail will be fine.

Thanks,
Janette

Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in
order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the
guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP
BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day
but have moved back up.

Thanks,

Kim
