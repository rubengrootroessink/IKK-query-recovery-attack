Since I have my long vacation in January, the less time I have to take off, the better - so I think a long holiday weekend would be good.  Let me know!

Ok, Ladies,

John Tlapek called tonight....we discussed a ski trip....he wanted me to ask
everyone for an alternative time to go, other than New Year's Eve......

Will each of you email me weekends in Dec/Feb/Mch, that you are currently
available...and I will match them together for
all 5 of us...and provide John w/ one or two dates...

THANKS, TAKE CARE,
TRICIA
