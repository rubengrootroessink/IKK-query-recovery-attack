Hello again,

Attached is a worksheet showing price indications for Calls that are $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00 out of the money.  I priced the puts that you would sell to me as 25% and 50% of the call premiums.

I did this for Aeco, Permian, and San Juan.  Let me know if there is another way that you would like to look at them.

Thanks,

Kim
