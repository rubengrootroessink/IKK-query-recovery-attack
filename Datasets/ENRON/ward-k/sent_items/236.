Darla,

I did run across some missing NSP deals for June and July and some price mismatches for a couple of NSP deals for July.  

For June, 3000/day priced at $4.70 and fior July. 3,100/day priced at $4.79.  Also, I am resending you July and the Yellow highlights show the two deals that I don't agree with the price.

Call me with quesitons

Thanks,

Kim
