Hey Lyndon!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy=
 back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things chang=
e between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on Janu=
ary 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Ma=
rtin look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before w=
e get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if y=
ou stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i=
n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.

As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo=
se to me was killed.  I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just =
in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to=
 be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was ca=
lled back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 =
am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had=
 that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him=
.  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve=
ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are=
 doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make =
me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th=
is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most =
things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed=
om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in=
 and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d=
one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away =
to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a=
ttitude! =20

Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th=
e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba =
for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of=
 the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go=
 back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!

Take care,

Love, K2

ps.  I have another email address at home.  It is kward1@houston.rr.com

To my lovely K2,

Sorry I haven't written in a while but life has been
passing by so fast that I rarely know what day it is.
I hope that you and any friends or family were not
hurt in any of the attacks on the USA. It's just
unbelievable that someone could hold so much hatred
for others that they would do these things. It's
beyond my realm of understanding.
I hope life is treating you well and you are safe.
As for me I am back a home and trying to decide
whether or not to leave and go back to work. I am
supposed to go back to the poly on the 7th Oct but
don't really want to leave home. It's so beautiful
here, and I am a little worried about the next war
that is going to happen. Worried for all hatred and
sadness that it is going to cause. Its really got me
thinking about living more in the present rather than
planning ahead, not that I have had much forethought
to begin with but something to think about.
I have some photos for you that should be attached to
this email.
Again I hope you are well and still loving this life.

Take Care

Love Lyndon
