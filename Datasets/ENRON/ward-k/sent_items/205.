I would love to - I really like going to the movies but never seem to make it!  Only one stipulation though - we don't go see planet of the apes!  I heard it was REALLY bad - possibly the worst movie ever made.

No innuendos at all, i just did not realize my cumulative rudeness!  Would you like to go to a movie some time this week or weekend?

I'm quite sure - but I don't understand your email.  Are you insinuating that I was being dramatic?  Not what I intended at all!

That I did not realize.  Are you sure?  Well, then, perhaps I could coerce you into seeing Apocolpse Now Redux or some other theatrical event?

It was fun - you missed out.  How could anything be more important than dinner @ vanny's?  especially when she made a cake!  You realize that that was the third time I've asked you to do something and you have said no.........

I would be but I already have plans.  I would like to do something later in the week though.  Were you in town this weekend?  My bro, sis in law and nephew were in all weekend and we had fun.  A lot of golf and some swimming with the little man.

Kim and I are having people over for dinner tonight at my house.  We are going to throw something on the grill, drink some cold beer and enjoy the Houston humidity.  Let me know if you are able to make it.
