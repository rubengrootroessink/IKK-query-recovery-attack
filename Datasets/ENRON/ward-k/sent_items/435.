Hey Lyndon,

How are you?  Long time - no email!  I hope things are going well for you.  Went to Happy Hour with Kim 1, Susie, Stacy, and Melissa last night.  Susie and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.  Kim 1 and Melissa left today for Cabo San Lucas.  As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.  Not nearly as much fun.  But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!  In other words - I am poor!  

Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.  I think we all hope we see you in Jan! 

Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!

Love, K2
