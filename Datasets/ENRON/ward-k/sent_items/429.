Mara,

Here is the proposed revised contract with Citizens.  Could you take a look at it and see if the logic works in accordance with the spreadsheet?  sort of like how you built the original spreadsheet from the original contract.  Let me know if you have any questions and how this turns out.

Thanks,

Kim

Here is a very rough draft of the amendment that 1)  clarifies the gas pricing and 2) adds firm peaking gas.  I will call to discuss.
