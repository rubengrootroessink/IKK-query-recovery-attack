Kim,

I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week.  If I were to characterize him, I would have to say that he reminds me of Schultz from "Hogan's Heroes".  He sees nothing.  He knows nothing.

I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about his gas/power positions.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about Burbank's power plant development.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him if he knew how to please a woman.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

In short, if you plan to meet with Burbank, make sure your meeting includes their traders.

Laird
