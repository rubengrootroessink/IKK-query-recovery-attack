Hey Mary Jo,

Sorry it has taken me so long to reply.  It sounds like a blast but I was unable to find good airfare.  I might check again today and if things change, I will let you know.  Thanks for thinking of me and for the invitation.  Maybe some other weekend - I do hope to see you again soon.

Kim

Items To Bring:
Also if anyone has a cooler they want to bring for water, soda  or other beverages for the bus that would be great.  The bus also has a CD  player and VCR if you have cd's to bring that would be great or a movie you have  been wanting to catch up on ;)

Subject: First Weekend in  Alexander Valley - Marvolous Merlot - Sunday November 4th 10:00 - 5:00
Thought everyone could use a day drinking wine and enjoying  the scenery of the Alexander Valley.
 
Wanted to gauge the interest and availability of friends  interested in partaking in this winery event.  There will be  complimentary wine tasting and food provided at four vineyards in Alexander  Valley.  
 
Please see the attached website for details.   http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html << File: http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html >> 
 
If there are enough people interested I was thinking of  arranging the rental of a party van/shuttle bus for the day Sunday November  4th, from 10:00 - 5:00 leaving from my house in the Marina.  After  talking with a few limo companies, the price per person for limo/shuttle  service will probably be around $50 - $60 for the day.
 
Please let me know tomorrow if you are available and  interested in participating. 
Please forward this email to others I may have missed on the  list too!
Thanks!
MJ
