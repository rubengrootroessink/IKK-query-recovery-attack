Jane,

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

thanks,

Kim

Mara;

I am wondering why the basis shown on the indicatives is much higher than
basis shown on Enron Online?  For example, basis to PG&E citygate on
EnronOnline is about $0.88 for Nov01-Mar02 and $0.78 for Nov02-Mar03, but
the indicative shows about $1.18 and $0.92 respectively.  Are these
different products?  Is the difference attributable to the indicatives being
for physical products?  Just trying to learn something.

Jane.
