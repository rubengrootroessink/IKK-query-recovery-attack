Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,

Kim

I believe he is the correct person to talk to, but if not, he can point you
in the right direction.
