Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - 

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....
