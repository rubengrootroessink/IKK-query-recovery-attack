I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda? 

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Thanks,

Kim
