That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!

BTW, Tom drove from 12th to 6th in his race.   Very impressive.  Also, Kramer told me yesterday that the SCCA tow fund is paying us $600 each.  Yeah!  It goes to the top 3 guys that go and there were only 3 guys from our region!  Also, did you know Jimmy won close to 10k for getting 2nd?  Spicer (winner) got something like 13k in cash and trinkets.

Cool!

Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -

K.
