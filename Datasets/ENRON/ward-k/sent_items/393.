Steve,

Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.  Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.

Also,  did you receive my indications for the products you were interested in?

Thanks,

Kim Ward
