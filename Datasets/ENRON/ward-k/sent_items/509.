Cliff,

     For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
