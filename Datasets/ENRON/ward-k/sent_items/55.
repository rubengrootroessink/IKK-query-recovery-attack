Monica,

Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  Let me know if you want to do anything or if you have any questions.  

Thanks,

I am assuming you're looking at the "daily" tab.  The first column reflects
actual usage.  The second column is a 30 day rolling average.

Could I get price indications from you today for a customer of ours.  Their
load is pretty small, ~ 200 MMBtu/day.  I need monthly prices at Malin and
Citygate starting July 2001 through June 2003.

Thanks,

Monica

Monica,

What is the difference in the volumes in the first column and those in the
second column?  I am working on this today and must discuss with the desk -
who will be managing the extra risk.  I hope to have something back to you
by tomarrow.

Thanks,

Kim

   Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our
   potential
   natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and
   would
   like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.

   As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid
   daily
   price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing
   market
   warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in
   the
   form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
   constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years
   of
   daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information
   when
   submitting your final proposal.

   Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.

   Regards,

   Monica V. Padilla
