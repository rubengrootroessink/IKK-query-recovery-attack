Frank,

I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She "recommended" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it? 

thanks,

Kim
