Kim,

I just got your e-mails. Sorry about missing your party, how was it? Hopefully you didn't have too much fun without me!

Next time, call me at 972-459-2705 to let me know you are having a party.

How is everything in Houston these days? Are you liking being back in Tejas?

Hope you are doing well and hope to see you soon.

Dave
