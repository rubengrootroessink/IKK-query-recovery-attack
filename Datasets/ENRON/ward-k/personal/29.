K2, how's life back in Texas?
I am not sure if I thanked you for making my first
singles cruise a little less like work and alot more
enjoyable. If not then Thank you. This past week was
terrible, so many drunk and abnoxious people. anyway
only one more to go and I am out of here. Not sure
what I will do except I know I am going home to relax,
back in Aus. Do some surfing and refocus on what it is
I want in life.
Hope all is well for you, your a sweet and beautiful
woman that deserves all the good things that come to
you.

Take Care

Love Lyndon
