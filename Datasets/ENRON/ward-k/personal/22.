    Two elderly gentlemen, who had been without sex 
    for several years, decided they needed to visit a 
    cat-house for some tail..... When they arrived, the 
    madam took one look at them and decided she wasn't 
    going to waste any of her girls on these two 
    old men. 
 
    So she used "blow-up" dolls instead. She put the 
    dolls in each man's room and left them to their 
    business. After the two men were finished, they 
    started walking home and began to talking. The 
    first man said, "I think the girl I had was dead. 
    She never moved, talked or even groaned... how 
    was it for you?" 
 
    The second man replied, "I think mine was a witch. 
    When I nibbled on her breast..... she farted and 
    flew out the window!"
