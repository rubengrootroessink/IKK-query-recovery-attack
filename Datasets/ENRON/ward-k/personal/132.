Yes, I realized where your name came from right AFTER I hit "send."  Duh!
That's what I get for being up so late.  But, anyway, good to hear from you.
I try to see your mom and dad at least once a year.  Kristen is so cute and
smart!  My mom just loves to get to see them, so I try to take her up now
and then.  She's getting a little short on memory these days, so I want her
to make the best of life while she still can.
I know you're glad to be closer to home.  Your mom showed us pictures of
your house.  It was beautiful.  Are you still traveling a lot?  That's
exciting for those of us who "go" now and then, but it's got to get old
after awhile, and nerve-racking these days.
Well, let me go, gotta get some sleep. tomorrow is a long day.
Keep in touch, tell your sister hi!
