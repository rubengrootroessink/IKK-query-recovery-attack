Just wanted to say Hi, I know  you are at work but had to share something.
About two weeks ago, we had to go to dinner at the Peabody with some business
people in town and Jeff introduced me to someone named Cam Smith.  Jeff had
told me he was from Cleveland, MS and his dad was Dr. Smith, OK I put it
together it was Bruce Orman's nephew,  Ok I feel really old NOW!!   He is
young starting out with this particular company that sells to Jeff.  Anyway,
he remembered you and said he always liked you so much.  He gave me scoop on
Bruce and Nancy about moving to Oxford, etc.  He was really nice and quite
country talking but he is married and lives somewhere north of Memphis in Tn.
    What a small world.   Just think you could be living in Oxford town with
that Postmaster!! H A! Just kidding, I would love to see you soon.  Maybe I
can visit you one day.   CT
