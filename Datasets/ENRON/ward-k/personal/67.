Life has been very busy back here on the poly. We have
just come out of wetdock and the ship is a mess but
will be awesome by the time you get here. Our first
cruise this week is a gay cruise, very strange!!!!!
Its not really my type of cruise. Seeing 2 guys
cuddling each other sleeping on the deck is a bit much
for me. I dont dislike it, its just I dont understand
it. Women are such beautiful creatures, why !!!
Anyway yes I will more than likely be here when you
get here, unless I get sacked or quit, but more than
likely I will be here.

Take Care
See you soon
Love Lyndon
