that is too weird, i had just started typing an email to you when i received
this from you.  glad you enjoyed the wine although you were supposed to wait
for me to come to houston to drink it.  not much new here i have just been
spending what seems like every spare minute on the beach lately and it makes
it really difficult to come to work.  this weekend was awesome, perfect
weather, great waves, etc.  i'm taking some surfing lessons next weekend,
looking forward to that.  been trying to be more active in the market
lately, still can't deal with you guys which costs me $$$ every day.
supposedly it will be worked out soon, we can deal in gas now just not in
power.  this marathon that i'm running in portland next month is
headquartered in the hilton downtown.  is the heathman the best place to
stay in that area or should i try somewhere else.  i stayed at the heathman
last time and it was ok.  making reservations right now for coer d'alene, do
i want a west facing suite (looking out at the lake)?  when it gets closer
to time you'll have to tell me what to get at the spa.  i plan on playing
golf and getting massages and doing little else.  i probably won't see a
soul from the conference except on the golf course.  i still am waiting to
hear from you when a good time would be to come to houston.  when you were
on your trip did you find a good island where i could go and no one could
ever find me and i could sit on the beach for the rest of my life drinking
pacificos?  it seems like every day that goes by i come closer to doing
it........anyways, hope all is well there, let me know what's going on with
you and what fabulous vacation you're going on next....
