Well, I'm finally settled in over here at Dynegy.  It sucks going back full
time and they don't have a gym.  I'm going to talk to my manager about
working out during lunch because there is no way I can after work.  Anyway,
I was looking at the Enron gym schedule and there are a few classes that
last 30 minutes.  That would work for me!  It's not really enough, but it
will have to do.
So far, so good.  I think the job will be interesting and I'm excited about
the experience.  Working full time is just really hard for me right now.
If I quit, or try to find another part-time position, I think I would be
shooting myself in the foot.  This is a great opportunity to get experience
if I can hack for at least a year.  I am going to approach them about a
9-80 schedule, though.  We'll see.  I'm supporting the traders, so that
might be difficult.
Let me know when you want to get together for lunch.  I have plans Thursday
and Monday so far.  By the way, did you ever have your housewarming party?
I saw that in my calendar and realized we never talked to you further about
it.  Things were pretty chaotic the last few weeks.

Hope all is well!
Jana
