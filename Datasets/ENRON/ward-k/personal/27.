Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the
US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the
appropriate industries and customers with our respective value
propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages
Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the
right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the
maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or
industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in
their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those
industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ
significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the
boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please
over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before
customer contact.

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption
or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in
ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be
managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical
that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal,
Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing
