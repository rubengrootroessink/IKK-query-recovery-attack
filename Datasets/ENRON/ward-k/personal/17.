Ms. Ward, what no message on the voice mail? I really think it is kind of
cute that you were chicken to leave a message. Modern technology.  I guess I
will have to be the brave one and pick up the phone. I hope your weekend was
fun. What time did you and your friend from California leave Downing? Look
forward from hearing from you soon...Stanton
