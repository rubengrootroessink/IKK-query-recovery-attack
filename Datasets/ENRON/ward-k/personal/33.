Kim,

The E-Connect Project is still underway and will probably be in production by the end of this month. E-Connect will be the newest way to connect to Enron's network from home or when traveling. However, attached is the instructions for an alternate way to connect to Enron. These instructions have been approved by my boss. They are self-install instructions, but since we are such good friends, I do not mind helping you out. If you need help setting up your Click@Home PC and/or VPN access to Enron, feel free to give me a call to schedule a time for a home install. I will be doing a home install for Mike Grigsby tomorrow around 6PM. He is in the Westheimer and Kirby area, so depending on where your live and if time permits I can help you as well. You can also give me a call and I can help you out over the phone.

  
You will need to have the BlackIce Software available for the second set of instructions. This CD was sent to all Click@Home customers in a blue folder/packet with a mousepad. I can give you a CD with just about everything you'll need, tomorrow.

Thanks,
