Sara Beth called and said that she thinks EAMR and Citizens have resolved the insurance issue.  I am hopeful that is the case.  

Attached are drafts of the ENA/Citizens Confirmation Agreement and the ENA/Citizens/Cogan Agreement.  Please review them both for final changes.  Once you have given final approval we will forward original Confirmation Letters for your signature.  With respect to the Cogan Letter, we would like Citizens to send the letter to us.  Let me know if this is OK.

Thanks

Chris
