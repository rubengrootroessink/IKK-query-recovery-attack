Kim, 
Citizens needs confirmation from ENA on deliveries to the TW/Griffith interconnect for the following: 
July 17 -  PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from Enron.  Citizens has billed them for the deliveries, but PPL has the deal as a purchase from Enron in there system and desire to have Enron bill them.  Is this acceptable to Enron? 
July 26 - PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from a third party, Texaco, in the basin and had it transported under the Citizens/PPL deal.  Does Enron agree with this transaction? 
Thanks, 
John
