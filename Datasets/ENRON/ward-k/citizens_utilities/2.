For April the indexes were as follows:

San Juan NGI - $4.51/MMBtu
SoCal:  $12.56
PG&E SoCal:  $7.71

So, PG&E is a  lot less valuable but still decent at $3.31 spread.  

Re: your question, the more I think about it the more I think PG&E is the 
relevant index.  A basket would be better for Citizens but less attractive to 
Griffith.  Can you sell them on the basket?

Thanks, Chris. 

What are your thoughts on using a basket approach to the index? ?As an  
alternative to just using either SoCal or PGE, we could use the average. ? 
Would any other index points be appropriate? 

See the attached file. ?I have provided for averaging the two indexes.
