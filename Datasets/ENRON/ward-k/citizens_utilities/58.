Lou,
Based on Jim's comments below, the attached revised version of the compromise proposal contains a change on the last page. 
 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
Please let us know if any other changes need to be made to the document before sending it to Citizens.
We hope to send the proposal to Citizens tomorrow morning after you have returned to the office and had an opportunity to review this e-mail.
Also, to let you kinow, Citizens Communications as of the end of 2000 held $7 Billion in assets and had adjusted EBITDA of $509 Million on revenues of $1.8 Billion.
Question:  What percentage chance is there that a court might set the indemnity aside as Jim mentioned below in the previous e-mail?

Chris,
Jim mentioned that ENA might want to consider being an additional insured under the insurance policy.  Any thoughts or comments?

Best regards,
Sarabeth

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Please review the attached proposed compromise to be sent to Citizens following internal review.  Lou worked with Don and myself to draft this document.  Jim and Chris, your comments are appreciated.  My apologies for the short turn around time, however, we need to get back to Citizens as quickly as possible due to the plant going commercial sometime between 6/18 and 6/21.
