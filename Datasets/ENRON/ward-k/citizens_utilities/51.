Chris, 

I hope that your voice is improving and that you are feeling better. 

I have attached a revised Citizens/Enron Griffith supply proposal and a  
redlined version to show the changes from your draft.  I have eliminated the  
$0.07 commodity add-on for Excess Utilities Volumes as we discussed  
yesterday.  I have also eliminated the late nominations provision since it is  
not in the Griffith proposal.  And, last, I have noted some pricing  
considerations for the Firm Peaking Requirements. 

Sean and I have not discussed this proposal so everything is subject to his  
agreement.  I hope to talk with Sean this morning. 

All the best, 

John
