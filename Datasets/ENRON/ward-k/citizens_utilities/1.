Sean/John,
We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will
available to discuss this proposal with Citizens.

Thanks

Terry
