Vladi, amigo ruso, de verdad:

?How are you doing my friend? I hope everything is cool with you. I`ve tried to catch you in the chat today
(just a few minutes ago) but you were not available. Ok, the purpose of this e-mail is to wish you the best in
this coming year, I know things are not easy right now and things are changing quickly for you, but you are an
incredible person and God (if you believe in God, but if you dont, it doesnt matter) save good and nice things
for good people like you. I know i havent been a good friend the last months (for various reasons i explained
to you over the phone last time) but you are the best friend I ever had (is serious, no just a phrase) and i
want for you just the best in this year and in the years to come. I promise to be in touch.

Your friend

Christian
