By 10:30 there will be a HR person (Dave Ciliberto) from UBS in the Control Center to answer any questions people may have.  Please inform your staff that they can feel free to walk in and ask him questions.  Also Kumar will be joining him sometime this morning.  Kumar is the Visa/Immigration person.  Here are some answers to a few FAQ that Dave gave me just a few minutes ago.

Position Applied For:  Same position you currently have at Enron
Salary Desired:  Same as you are currently making
Date you can start:  Immediately
Do I have to list all 10 years of employment: Yes to the best of your knowledge
What if I can not remember salary or supervisor: I can not remember is an acceptable answer
Is DWI a felony:  Yes

Note:  Accuracy is most important; therefore, if you can not remember something that is on the application, state you are not sure.

Any other questions please stop by and see Dave in the Control Center.

thanks,
bbh
