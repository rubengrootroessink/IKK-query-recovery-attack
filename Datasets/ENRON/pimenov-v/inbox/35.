Hey Vladi
 
Mike asked me to revise a couple of things on that file. Can you give me a hand when you get here today? I've started already... Just had a couple of questions for you.

Thank you.  Can revise the file to include Socal border and show which prices are NGI and which are Inside Ferc.  Also, can you show the Gas Daily prices by day dating back to Oct for all points.  
 
Mike
