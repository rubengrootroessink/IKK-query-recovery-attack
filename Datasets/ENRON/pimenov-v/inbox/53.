Greetings! 

Attached you'll find some reading materials for an introduction to the 
Crude, Coal, NGL and Refined products industry. 

Included is a general glossary of terms that we'll be using, PowerPoint 
presentations for the Petroleum and Coal business, as well as some 
documentations on refining, basics of NGL's and Crude Oil production, 
refining, transportation and trading. 

In addition, if you look on our intranet site, there is some additional 
information to familiarize you with the business. It's located at 
<http://inside.allegrodevelopment.com> under Industry Information. 

After reviewing this data, you all should have a good knowledge of basic 
terms and practices in the business. 

Thanks for your attention, as I look forward to working with each of you 
next week! 

Christopher Wich, Jr.
