Guys,

Here are the people that have agreed to contribute $25 each for the Playstation 2 that I will go buy for Francesco today:

Federico
Pedro
Massimo
Biliana
Vladi & Natasha
Claudio
Marco
Mauro
Pietro
Farhad

(Eltin and Paul I could not reach but I immagine they'll probably want to come in at the $25 level or some other)

We should convene at some point tonight to sign the card and figure out when to give him the gift


Playstation is $299 +tax and I will charge it on my credit card. Please reimburse me as soon you can.


Thank You
Massimo
