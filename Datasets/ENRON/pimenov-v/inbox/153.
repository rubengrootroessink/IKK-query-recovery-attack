Natalie:  If it happens, you have approx. 60 days to find another position before we cancel the HIB with the INS.
Let's think positive!

Margaret,

Could you, please, tell me how many days will I have to find a new job to maintain my H1B visa status in case I'm laid off by Enron? 

Everything is fine right now, I'm working but I just want to know what options I have in a worst-case scenario.

Thank you,
Natalie
