Hello All!

	I was planning an outing this weekend to play frisbee golf (http://www.hfds.org/).  I'm thinking this Saturday 1/12 at Jim Mozola (Memorial Park)
around 2pm.  If you've never played before it's free to play at the park you just need to swing by Academy sports or any sporting good store and buy
a disc.  If you ask a salesperson for frisbee golf discs they should be able to show you were they are.  They run $5-$7, and I would recommend
just buying a driver disc, I have a putter we can all use.


If you've got any questions call me 713.628.0170
