Alejandra,

here is the information that I hope you'll be using from time to time: :)
e-mail: vladislav@lycos.com
birthday: october 1st
phone no.: 713 993-00-67

Although my phone no.# might change if they kick me out of Enron :), I think my birthday and e-mail won't.

Stay in touch!!!

Vladi.

P.S. Please forward me your info too.

Hello to everyone.

I hope each of you can make it tomorrow, but if you can't I hope we can still keep in touch.  I'd love to have your address, email (external), birthday, and phone number. I'd also like to thank each of you for your friendship during this past year.  It has been great working with you!  Peace and blessings to all.

Alejandra
