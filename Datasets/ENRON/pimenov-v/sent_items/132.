Mi amigo ruso:

Receive my best wishes in this day of your birthday. I`ve tried to contact you through the messenger but the
connection is broken here at the university. I hope they reestablish the connection before five. I havent
forget about your birthday. At what time are you gonna be at home tonight to give you a friendly call. Dont
consider you are old if your spirit and soul is young, you always keep young. Celebrate with a giant party
today and remember i never forget the good and sincere friend you are.

Your humble friend, a caballote!!!!!

Chris
