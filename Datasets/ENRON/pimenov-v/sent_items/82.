John,

sorry for not sending it to you earlier (totally forgot to open my outlook).
Raw data is on the fisrt tab of the file to the right.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Vladi,

Do you still have the historical nymex settle file that you created for Lavo's spread analysis?  If you do would you send me a copy?  Thanks.

John
