Shippers 

Re: Meeting to Address Processing Plant Issues

Transco has been asked by several of its customers to 
address the dynamics of gas processing and its corresponding 
impact on gas quality and the overall operations on the 
Transco system.  In response, Transco will host a meeting in 
Houston from 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday,  October 17, 
2001 at the Williams Tower to bring together 
producer/operators, processing plant operators and local 
distribution companies.  

The meeting will be in a round-table discussion format to 
enable a wide-ranging, open dialogue among participants that 
are impacted by the dynamics of gas prices and processing 
margins. 

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 by Friday, 
October 12, 2001 so that the appropriate facilities can be 
made available.  


Ronald C. Doyle, Director Gas Management and Control
