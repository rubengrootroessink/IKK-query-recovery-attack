Pfizer Corp. (NYSE PFE) is making the announcement today that VIAGRA will
soon be available in liquid form and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola (Pepsi
bottling Group NYSE PBG) as a power beverage suitable for use  as-is, or as
a mixer, under the name "Mount And Do".   Pepsi's proposed ad campaign
suggests: "It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a
stiff one."
