Sean,

Elizabeth should be familiar with what I will be refering to in this note, so please reference her if need be...

There are several ENA sales for Sep-01 production to Coral Energy Canada, Inc. which the counterparty is claiming should be billed under Coral Canada US, Inc.  The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.  I am unaware of that occuring or even if that is the correct procedure.

I am cc'ing Vladi Pimenov because Sitara shows him as having created at least one of the deals.  Maybe he can clarify things for us.  One example of such deals is 1026087.  Bottom line is I need a way of receiving payment from Coral on these items.

All - please advise.
