Sorry!  Here are the bullets: 
- 2,500 mile pipeline extending from west Texas to the California border with 1.7 Bcf/day of peak capacity
- Maximum Rate Environment Due to Increased California Demand
- Bi-Directional Flow Capabilities Provides Flexibility to Rapidly Adapt Regional Demand
- Over 90% of Revenues From Demand Charges
- Western Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2005, Eastern Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2002; Well-Positioned for Recontracting
- No New Rate Case Until November 2006
- Overbuilding into Cal. can compromise resubscription of contracts (not unique to TW)

The slide includes these bullets, a map of TW and a barchart with 1999-2001 throughput.  I asked Gina to change the 90% to 80% in 4th bullet.  How do you feel about the "Maximum Rate Environment ..." bullet?

I have no way of seeing the slide on my Blackberry. Do you want to fax it to my hotel. I can look at it tonight.
