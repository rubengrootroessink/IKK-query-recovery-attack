I taked with Kathy about WFS.  They are not an owner, but are transporting on NWPL's capacity in the Hub.  Please see the attached revised document where I've added to the explanation of the Hub agreements.

The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, Williams Field Services is not an "owner" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a "hub" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.
