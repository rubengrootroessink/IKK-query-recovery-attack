Dear Ahmed,

	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with Khalid!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, Khalid will be a good sleeper.  I told Amy that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe Tony, Sam & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that Sam will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San Antonio (Tony's brother Larry's boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	Sam is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  Sam has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will Khalid be?  Sam is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and Charlie have started driving here today.  They will get to Houston tomorrow night.  Tony is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that Sam knows my mom, Charlie, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that Sam will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet Khalid and take care of Amy.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
Lindy
