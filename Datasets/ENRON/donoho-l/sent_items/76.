Thanks!  I just wanted to know the schedule to see if we needed to leave a key out for ya'll on Thursday or anything.  Sam & I will be home by the time you get to the house.  Friday is my day off, so that works out well.  We're looking forward to seeing you guys! Get ready to be "bossed" by the master =)  Sam's running the show!

Love, 
Lindy
