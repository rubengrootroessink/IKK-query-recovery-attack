Okay.  I've already drafted some Marketing Strategy stuff that Steve's reviewing.  Let me know when you want to get together to discuss.

Lindy:
The next parts that we will need some help on in the TW business plan is -

1) Risks - contract rolloffs and competitive threats
2) Growth opportunities (e.g. TransPecos, Sun Devil and the Bakersfield projects)
3) Marketing strategy

I have attached an updated Business Plan. Please insert your thoughts in the appropriate section - it may be helpful to talk about it first!
Thanks,

Kevin
