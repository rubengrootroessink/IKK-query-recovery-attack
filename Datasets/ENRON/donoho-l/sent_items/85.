How are you?!  It's so good to hear from you.  Of course I get the updates from Lorrainey & I knew about your new job.  I hope everything is going well there.  Lorraine said that you really liked it.  I thought of Florabama when I heard you were hired at Duke.  Lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive (I don't think) in our negotiations with them.  We need to meet you for lunch someday.

It would be great to see Jeff too, if we could get ahold of him.  He called the other day with a building question.  He sounded good and said Lisa had some irons in the fire.

Everything here is...wierd!!  And it's pretty sad.  The NNG commercial people go over (red rover, red rover) to Dynegy starting Friday.  (This would include Mary Kay - talk about a midlife crisis!)  It's all pretty sad (along with Lay resignation, Baxter suicide, etc.)  The new guy started today - who knows?!

How is Craig?  It looks like Calpine is holding their own.  I've left some messages for Diana, but haven't heard back from her.

Sam is wonderful.  He is talking alot and he's very busy!!  My dad and my stepmom, Flo, were here this last weekend for a visit.  Tony and I got to go out to dinner and to a movie - WOW!

Thanks for keeping in touch.  Let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon.

Lindy

Hi Lindy!  Laura McGuire and I were talking about you today.  Remember we
were working on Florabama and we met her for lunch and it was pouring down
rain?!  She was in my office today for a meeting and it took us a while to
remember how we knew each other.  She got married in January; I think her
new last name is Heckman.

Anyway, I was thinking about you and I hope you're doing well thru all this
Enron mess.  How is Sam?  talking up a storm already?

Take care--

Susan
