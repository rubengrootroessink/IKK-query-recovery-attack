Just wanted to let you know I had a phone message from Nancy Mallard(sp?) today.  Her daughter is a bunny.  She had a suggestion for the basket.  The James Avery catalog has some sterling silver charms (for a bracelet or a necklace) that are bugs.  A dragon fly ($17.50), a honey bee ($12.50) and a lady bug ($15).

I left her a message and told her I thought it sounded like a great idea.  I told her we would get back with her after next week (& collecting donations) to see if she would like to purchase one to donate for the basket or if she could provide us with the catalog (because I don't receive that one).  I've already looked on the internet to see if I could get a look.  Apparently, there's not a website.

FYI, we'll touch-base later.
