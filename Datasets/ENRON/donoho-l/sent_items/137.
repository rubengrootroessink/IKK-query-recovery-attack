I tried to find the original spreadsheet that I'm sure you sent me where you calculated these quarterly rates, but I can't find it.  Do you recall these rates?  My question is, I think we used just demand dollars (so I don't think commodity is in here) - how is it that the San Juan rates are above the maximum $.1020?  There really aren't any surcharges for San Juan to Thoreau transactions.  Can you try to look at this to see why the rate might be averaging greater than max?

Thanks!!
