Attached is the list of items and prices.  I'll put a check for $37 in Amanda's bag today (if I'm there before you) or tomorrow.  It might be today if I can arrange to meet Rita to drop-off my items to her during lunch.  Maybe I'll get to see you there dropping-off stuff - I'd love to see everything picked-out.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Lindy
