Here is the final version from Houston with the additional changes recommended by Mary Kay and the correction to the filing date.  No other changes have been made to the document distributed last night.

Rita - Please keep in mind our conversation this afternoon regarding additional comments that resulted from my meeting with Shelley, Lynn, Terry and Darrell during our review/approval of these reports.  Let me know if any of these reports are modified so we have a copy of the final version filed with the FERC.

Thanks,
