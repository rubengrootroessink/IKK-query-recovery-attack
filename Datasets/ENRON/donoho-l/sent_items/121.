It's just one slide.  The 2nd bullet is true in the recent past, but not necessarily going forward.  I'd have to check with Jan tomorrow if the 4th bullet is in the ballpark.  Neither of these bullets represent a timeframe - Gina said this is very high level.  I guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat.  Let me know if you have comments.  Gina said she had been running this all past Rod.
