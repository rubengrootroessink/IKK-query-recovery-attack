Amy & Ahmed,
	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy!
	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,
Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids

Subject: Pictures & News from Khalid


Hi Everyone:

Khalid is doing great and is a very happy baby.  As you can see from the pictures, he loves to laugh and smile at his Daddy!

He is still on his same schedule.  He sleeps every night from about 8:00 PM until 7:00 AM.  He loves to go to bed at night.  If it is after 8:00 PM he is rubbing his eyes and looking for his bed!  He likes to sleep in but if it is past 7:30 AM, we have to wake him up!

He eats 8 oz. 4 times per day - at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM.  He is definitely a growing boy - hardly any of his clothes fit anymore!  His 3-6 month clothes just fit him but will not for very much longer.  I have started buying him 6-9 month clothes.  He still does not like socks or anything on his feet - he kicks them right off.

He loves to put his hands in his mouth and suck on them.  He also still loves to look at all of his toys in his bed and his all-time favorite is definitely still his mobil!

His teachers at school tell Ahmed and me that he is the best baby there.  They definitely have some babies that are "high maintenance" but Khalid is not one of them.  He loves his teacher, Miss Janice, and smiles at her all the time.

We have noticed lately that he really likes to watch football - we have no idea where he would have picked that up :)

Khalid likes to go outside for walks both at school and at home when it is nice outside.  Our weather has been in the high 50's and low 60's so we have been going a lot.  It is great exercise for me and Khalid likes to be on the move!

Ahmed and I are doing great - enjoying these last couple of weeks of football before we go into mourning for 7 months!

Khalid sends his love to each and every one of you.  We hope to see all of you soon.

Love,
Amy, Ahmed & Khalid
