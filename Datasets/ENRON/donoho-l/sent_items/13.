Ava has received several RSVP's for the meeting, but the hotel has not received many calls for rooms.  Ava is trying to determine if the rooms still need to be blocked-out.  She will call the customers for us if we would provide the phone #'s to her.

Could you please fill in the phone #'s for your accounts and forward to Ava Garcia?

Thanks!
