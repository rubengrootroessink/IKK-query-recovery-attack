Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona
