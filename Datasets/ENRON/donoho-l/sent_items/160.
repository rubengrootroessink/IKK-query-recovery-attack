Here is the projected subscribed capacity and revenue through 2010.  This was updated in February, 2002.  Please review it to determine all of this info is appropriate to be provided to the rating agencies.  Most (if not all) of TW's contracts have confidentiality provisions concerning the rates.  I'm assuming we have Confidentiality Agreements with the rating agencies.
