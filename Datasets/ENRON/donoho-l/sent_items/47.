It looks good!  I had a few comments on pages 7 & 9.

Also, on page 13 - # 26 & 27, is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we "understood" and why they "knew" that the San Juan lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with Pan Alberta that existed prior to and after the Global Settlement rates were negotiated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan Alberta, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes.
