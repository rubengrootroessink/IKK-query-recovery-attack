Amy & Ahmed,
	Thank you so much for the pictures of Khalid.  We are so disappointed we will not get to see him at Christmas.  Maybe we can plan a trip to Memphis sometime in the coming year.  I wanted to let you know that we've sent a box of "stuff" to your house.  They are hand-me-downs from Sammy - clothes & his whirlin' twirlin' garden.  Please feel free to sell in a garage sale or donate anything you don't want/need.  Hopefully he can get some use out of some things.
	How are you all?  Getting ready for the trip to Omaha?  Are you driving or flying?  Everyone is good here.  We will get the kids Friday and have them until the evening of Christmas Eve.  Sam is having a Christmas party at school this Thursday.  I'm going to be baking cookies for that.  Sam is wonderful!!  He is the sweetest boy.  I've finally figured-out the digital camara, so I'll try to send some pic's soon.
	Take care.  We love & miss you.  Lindy
