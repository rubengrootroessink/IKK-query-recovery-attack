It's showing the percentage of capacity subscribed vs. total capacity.

On slide 28 the graph is a percent of what?  Is it revenue or something else?

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?
