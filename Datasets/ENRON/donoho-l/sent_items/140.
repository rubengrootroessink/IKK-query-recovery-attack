How does this look?  The first slide is the flyer to be distributed to the parents in the kids' bags.  The second slide I'll print to put on a large manila envelope for the each classroom door.

Did I forget any info?  Does it sound voluntary enough?

Let me know your comments and I'll run it past someone in the office this evening or on Monday and try to have the envelopes out on Monday.  I'll collect the checks each evening when I pick-up Sam.

Thanks,
Lindy
