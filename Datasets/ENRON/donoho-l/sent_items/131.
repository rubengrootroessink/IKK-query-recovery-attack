Yes, I'll be working a regular 5x8 schedule.

What voicemail?  Are you thinking of someone else?

Are you going to be working a regular 5x8 schedule?

Did my voicemail address your question from yesterday?

Thanks,

Fran

Effective March 1, 2002, I will not be working the 9/80 schedule anymore.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks,
Lindy
