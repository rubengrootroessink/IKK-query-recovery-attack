According to Glen, these were just orders granting rehearing on some issues=
.  We still have to proceed with compliance of the requirements.  We're sub=
mitting our first report on Friday for the month of August.

Subject:=09RE: Two proceeding changes

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 e=
ither, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing re=
quests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the follow=
ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercia=
l and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without re=
ading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O=
MB ruling a good sign. =20


As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budge=
t (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for "Reporting o=
f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market" through the six-month emergen=
cy period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements a=
re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  Howev=
er, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re=
porting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Informat=
ion Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as p=
art of its supporting statement (more specifically, "include an explicit di=
scussion").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of th=
e FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems =
with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co=
llection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business=
 in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep o=
ur records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, =
and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan=
t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale=
.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to=
 the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir=
es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo=
rting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it=
 intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide w=
ith the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical uti=
lity of requiring disaggregated data when "commenters" reported that they d=
id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. =
 OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d=
ata manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation woul=
d likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti=
mates after "consulting with respondents", and it must provide a list of th=
e names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would =
not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be =
that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sen=
ds a signal!
