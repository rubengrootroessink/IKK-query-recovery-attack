Hello!  I was asleep at the wheel there.  I'll have Gina change that to 85% subscribed on average through 2005.  

There is not time period referenced on the max rate statement.

What period does the max rate assumption cover. The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005. That is not true.
