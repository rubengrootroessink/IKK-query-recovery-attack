Can we all plan to get on the phone with Maria tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with Elizabeth about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.

Elizabeth, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call Maria?

Thanks!
