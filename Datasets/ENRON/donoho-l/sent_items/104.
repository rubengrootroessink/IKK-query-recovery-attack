I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription fro=
m now through Q3 2006:

The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of Ea=
st and Ignacio to Blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period.  The=
 forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to=
 California, not East to East or Ignacio to Blanco capacity.  I don't think=
 that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate=
.

The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San Juan group.

The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.

The volume of Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for resubscription shoul=
d be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that=
 then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts exist=
ed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern wh=
en we purchased the facilities from NWPL.)  Because of this "artificial bre=
ak" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San Juan lateral rate =
once on a contract from Ignacio to Blanco and then again on another contrac=
t from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this c=
apacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the=
 Blanco Hub and Transwestern will only extract the San Juan lateral rate on=
ce from Ignacio to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  Jan and I will look at t=
he Ignacio capacity that has historically continued on Transwestern south o=
f the Blanco Hub (vs. delivering to El Paso at Blanco).  We will come up wi=
th a % to be applied to the Ignacio to Blanco capacity that should be resub=
scribed at a zero rate (or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced -=
 whichever is easier to put in the model).
