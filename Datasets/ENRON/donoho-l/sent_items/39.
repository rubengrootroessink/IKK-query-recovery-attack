Save the date for another exciting, thrilling, the place to be gathering at T.K.'s on , Saturday, October 13th at 7:00 p.m.

The dinner theme will be Italian food. You will be able to experience the culinary delights of Loretta (T.K.'s sister) and tour T.K.'s new renovated kitchen (by our own Tony Donoho).  

Don't miss this event and mark your calendars now.  More details will be forthcoming.
