Yes, Shelley & I discussed this on Monday.  Isn't that interesting?  I wish we could slip this into some data request or something.

Lindy,  I accidentally left you off my earlier distribution to the marketers.  FYI, Kim.

FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million
