That's what I was asking Jan previously - does the 1.8 Bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number?

Gina, I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today.

Thanks!  Should I call an estimate or is this actual?  Also, any changes on the slide I sent yesterday?

Gina

Jan,
	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?
