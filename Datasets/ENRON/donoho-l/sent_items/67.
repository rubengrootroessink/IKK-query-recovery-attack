We spoke briefly with Randy this morning and let him know that Richardson took the gas in Dec the 22-31.  He was okay with this.  He wants to wait to change the volume until the 12th.  We told him you would let him know later today the amount he should nominate for Jan 12-31.

Here's our calculation.  Please confirm or correct and forward to Randy when you get in this afternoon.

Thanks!
