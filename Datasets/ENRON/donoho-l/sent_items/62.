Lindy, you have received the revised Blanco Hub Partnership 2002 O&M Budget (Overheads corrected).  I'm working with Devon Hunt with NWPL on the La Plata A/Ignacio Pipeline 2002 O&M Budget to correct the overheads on it.  Everything else on the Operating Budget was agreed on by the Partners as John stated, only the overhead amount has to be revised.  As soon as I get this straightened out I'll send you the corrected budget.

						Thanks,  tj

Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

THANK YOU!!

Lindy
