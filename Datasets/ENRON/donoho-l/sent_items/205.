Oh!  Doesn't he just steal your heart?  Thank you for the pictures.  I have the 3rd one on my screen background.  What an angel!  I'm glad you liked everything and it fits.  I hope you can find a tiny little picture of his sweet little face to put in his blue bejeweled frame.  

Isn't our Sam a handsome boy!  He says pickle, boat, nose, eyes, daddy's car, grandma (this is when he's referring to Tony with a blanket wrapped around his head like a scarf), milk, water, beans, hush chloe & I get binky.  He is wonderful.

Sam & I are bonding this weekend.  The kids were all 3 going to NYC with Lisa for the weekend, but Anthony doesn't want to go.  So, he's staying with us, but he and Tony are going to the river in Utopia, TX to take Anthony deer hunting for the first time.  They're staying at Tony's grandma's house.  She's very excited to see them. Anthony is very excited and wanted to know if they could get him some "camo" Friday night (it's all about the clothes these days).

That's about all I know.  It's good that you're going into work and getting out of the house.  It sounds like you're hanging in there.  I hope you're able to get some more sleep.  I'm sure it won't seem soon enough, but you will get to sleep again sometime in the next year or so =)  (It does sound like a long time when you say it out loud.  Sorry.  It'll go by fast!)

I'm excited that Khalid will be baptized by your friend.  He sounds like an enlightened man and I think it's nice for him to recognize both your and Ahmed's faith.  Khalid is a lucky baby.  I wish we could be there.

Take care and tell Ahmed hi.  Give Khalid a kiss & a squeeze.

Love,
Lindy
