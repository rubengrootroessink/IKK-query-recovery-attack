Kevin needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI Kevin, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.)
