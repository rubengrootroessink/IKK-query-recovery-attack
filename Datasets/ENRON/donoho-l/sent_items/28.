Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday dear Margy, happy birthday to you!

How are you?  Brett?  Shayne & Summer?  Your family?  I hope everyone is well and coping with all that has happened.  We are fine down here.  My mom & Charlie are coming for a visit next week.  They were flying, but now they're driving.  I think we could all get into the whole family truckster thing again.  Tony & I have decided we probably need the van with the TV/VCR in the ceiling now.  By the way, how is Summer?  What did the doctor have to say about her germ thing, etc?  I hope you all are working through that ok.

I hope you are doing something special for your birthday - going out to dinner with your family & kids and/or maybe a night out with just Brett & you - there's a treat!  Tony & I got a babysitter (one of Sam's teachers) last Saturday for no particular reason and just went out to eat & to a movie (Serendipity - it was a cute romantic comedy.  Just about all I need these days - light & funny & not too much brain power.)

Well, please take the time to celebrate this day - the day we all lucked out and you were born!  Tell Brett it really was his lucky day!  Spend some time with your mom & dad - they were both there =)  And remember the best birthday gift you ever got - the gift of this life - what more wonderful thing could there be?  It was a gift to all of us that have the pure pleasure of knowing you, Margy.  My life would not be the same without you =)

I love you & miss you, my friend. 

Lindy
