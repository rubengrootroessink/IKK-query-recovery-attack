Maria, Please let me know when  you can meet tomorrow.  TK is out tomorrow through Dec 26th, but we can't meet this afternoon because Elizabeth is out today.  So, let me know when Elizabeth & I can get with you tomorrow.

Can we all plan to get on the phone with Maria tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with Elizabeth about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.

Elizabeth, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call Maria?

Thanks!
