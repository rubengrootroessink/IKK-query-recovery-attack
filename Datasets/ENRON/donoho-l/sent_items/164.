Well, I can't meet at 10:00.  Steve just asked me to attend a "Stan restructuring" meeting for him at 10:00 (Steve's on vacation).  I'd say let's reschedule for this afternoon, but I want to wait to see if there's anything we have to do ASAP from this meeting this afternoon.  Let me get back with you.

Cheers.

I got your message.  They just got my phone and computer hooked-up (I'm on 39 now).  Can you get together tomorrow?  How about 10:00?  Let me know.

Thanks, 
Lindy
