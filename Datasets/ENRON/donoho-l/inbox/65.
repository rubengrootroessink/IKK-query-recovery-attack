In honor of Breast Cancer Month and those who have suffered you have been t=
agged by an Angel.


You have been tagged by the Friendship Angel (\o/) Which means you are a gr=
eat friend! If this was sent to you it means you are a good friend! PLUS IF=
 I HAD MY LIFE TO LIVE OVER I would have invited friends over to dinner eve=
n if the carpet was stained and the sofa faded. I would have eaten the popc=
orn in the "GOOD" living room and worried much less about the dirt when som=
eone wanted to light a fire in the fireplace. I would have taken the time t=
o listen to my grandfather ramble about his youth. I would never have insis=
ted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair had just b=
een teased and sprayed. I would have burned the pink candle sculpted like a=
 rose before it melted in storage. I would have sat on the lawn with my chi=
ldren and not worried about grass stains. I would have cried and laughed le=
ss while watching television and more while watching life. I would have gon=
e to bed when I was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a ho=
lding pattern if I wasn't there for the day. I would never have bought anyt=
hing just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil or was guaranteed to=
 last a lifetime. Instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy, I'd hav=
e cherished every moment realizing that the wonderment growing inside me wa=
s the only chance in life to assist God in a miracle. When my kids kissed m=
e impetuously, I would never have said, "Later. Now go get washed up for di=
nner." There would have been more "I love you's" and more "I'm sorry's" but=
 mostly, given another shot at life, I would seize every minute.....look at=
 it and really see it ... live it ... and never give it back. In honor of W=
omen's History Month and in memory of Erma Bombeck who lost her fight with =
cancer. Here is an angel sent to watch over you (\ /)


    Pass this on to five women that you want watched over. If you don't kno=
w five women to pass this on to, one will do just fine.
