 The attached file has July 2001 and September 2001 analyzed.

I have compared the TW Balance Report to Actuals for July 2001 (see attached spreadsheet) and feel that the Fuel Retention numbers are good.  The Fuel Burned numbers are generally too low due to missing 3-days of actuals and some fuel meters are inputted only once a month and will be missing from the balance report.  However, when you use Ken's report just estimate the fuel numbers 25% higher and you will be OK.

The remaining volumes (Retention less Fuel less Sales) will equal imbalances and UAF.  Ken's report (area under construction) needs work to solve the imbalance question and we can discuss this next week.  He will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday.

Also, I want to make one thing clear.  Sales go to the bottom line, however if your selling imbalance gas received from a customer or line pack you will have an expense offset that also goes to the bottom line.   Conversely, if you are repaying (giving) gas to a customer you will have an expense credit that goes to the bottom line.  Over-retained gas (Retention less Fuel less UAF) is the only bottom line amount.  You can sell the gas outright or sell it to the customers imbalance or linepack.  If you sell it to linepack or volume valued imbalances, you will have taken on commodity risk.  We can discuss TW's risk profile next week.
