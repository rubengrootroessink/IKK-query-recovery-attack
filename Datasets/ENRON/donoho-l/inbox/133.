Hello Lindy Lou,

How are you? Thank you for the great picture of Sam for Halloween. What are you doing for Thanksgiving? I am having both sides his family and mine--If there is an explosion on the national news in Omaha you'll know what it is. It should be fun. We are expecting 30 people. How is work? Are you secure in your position. The market looks so bad. I think I heard some company is to purchase Enron is that accurate? I am now working 4 days a week and loving it. We miss the money but not enough to resume full time. I was just thinking of my many blessings and you popped in my head. Tell Tony hello. Take care. I love you. Holly
