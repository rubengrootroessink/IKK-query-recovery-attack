***PLAYBOY SEEKING "WOMEN OF ENRON" FOR PICTORIAL LAYOUT
   Saying its goal is to give Enron's female employees an opportunity that
could "lead them down a new career path," Playboy magazine has launched a
national campaign seeking women willing to shed their clothing for an upcoming
pictorial layout entitled "Women of Enron."
   "When one door closes, another one opens," said Playboy's photo director
Gary Cole, referring to the collapse of Enron and along with it, most of its
employee's savings.
   And so far the response has been phenomenal according to the Playboy
spokesperson.
   "We've put the press release out five hours ago and the amount of
interested women is substantial," Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeh Norris told
OPIS. "We have no limit on how many Enron women we'll use in the layout."
   Norris added that Playboy hopes to have issue out as soon as possible and
is pushing for a summer release.
   To be eligible candidates must be at least 18 years of age and be able to
document their employment at Enron, along with a valid birth certificate and
photo ID. A recent photo in a two-piece swimsuit and a head-and-shoulders
portrait is also required.
   For additional information, call 312-373-2758.
