Due to recent concerns about the lack of security over wireless networks, all wireless hubs will be disconnected from the Enron network on Tuesday, 3/26.  Enron Network Services will continue to investigate alternative wireless security methods.  If you have any questions concerning this action please, please contact Mary Vollmer @ ext. 33381.
