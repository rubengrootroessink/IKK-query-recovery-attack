FYI - I am forwarding the attached file (matrix200111), which provides a matrix of TW's max tariff rates as well as a table of the base res. and comm. rates and reservation surcharges for the Global Settlement contracts.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or Rita.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Please post the attached TW rate matrix, MATRIX200111.doc, effective 11/1/2001.

Only the rates for the "Current Shippers" as defined in TW's Global Settlement changed,
including Reservation, Commodity and TCR surcharges.
