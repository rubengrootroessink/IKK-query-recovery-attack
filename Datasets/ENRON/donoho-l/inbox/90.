Lindy:

John just emailed me the pictures of Sam.  He is the cutest!  I can't
get over how much he has grown since I saw him.  Your Dad is anxious to
see these pictures so I have run copies on my color printer--they came
out great.  Good job!

I've been thinking about you a lot and know these are stressful times.
Somehow I guess it all works out like it is supposed to.  

Give Sam hugs and kisses from us and of course some for you and Tony
too.

Love you,
Flo
