I wanted to let you know that I sent you the TW Daily Balance report in Business Objects this afternoon. When you get a chance, will you retrieve it and try to refresh it, please? It may take a couple of minutes to refresh, so don't worry if it seems to be taking a long time.

By having the report yourself, we can start working on automating your imbalance monitoring process, or at the very least, we may be able to come up with a way to make the estimated imbalance on the report more accurate, as Tracy and Dan requested.

Let me know how it goes. 

Thanks.
