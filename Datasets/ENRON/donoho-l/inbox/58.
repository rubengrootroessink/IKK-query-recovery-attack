Lindy, you want the first tab with the blue highlight for the contract closing price for the following month.

Attached is a spread sheet that has various NYMEX information.  One tab has the daily close, with the day that the contract expired highlighted in blue.   The other tab has the close at the end of the month.

Call me if you have questions.
