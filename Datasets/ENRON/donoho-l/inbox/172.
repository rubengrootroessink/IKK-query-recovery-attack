The following items were presented in last week's change control meetings....

Nov. 29
Shared Folder Move "Common" located on GTA\SYS2\ will be moved to GTHOU-DV01\data1\Transfer.  In an effort to migrate the remaining GTA Common folders from the old GTA server to our current Windows 2000 server, GTHOU-DV01\Common, we are asking you to do the following:
?	Review the folders on gphou-nwgway1\gta2\Common.
?	Identify the folders you are currently using.
?	Reply back with a list.
?	Only the folders identified on the reply back will be moved!

Dec. 1-2
