Ramona,

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

ab.

Andy,
I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Ramona

I know it has been a while, but I wanted to send you the follow-up on our conversation last week, to make sure I heard everything correctly.

Please let me know if the notes don't correctly reflect your memory of the conversations.  

Thanks a bunch!
