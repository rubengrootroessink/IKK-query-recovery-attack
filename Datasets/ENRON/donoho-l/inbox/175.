Lippman Consulting, Inc. is proud to announce that it has started publishing 
a monthly Great Lakes Pipeline Report. This report will provide our clients 
with up to date information on the 2 Bcf/d capacity system that is a vital 
link to Canadian supplies. The report will detail the supply movements east 
from Emerson through the Great Lakes  system till it reaches delivery back 
into Canada at St. Clair.    

The cost for the report is $110 per month on an annual subscription basis or 
the report can be purchased on a quarterly basis for $220. If you would like 
additional information on this report or on any of our other products, please
