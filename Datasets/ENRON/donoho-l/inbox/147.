I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.
