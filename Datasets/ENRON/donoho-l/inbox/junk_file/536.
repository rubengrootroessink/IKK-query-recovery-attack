Ramona,
Yes, K 24954 is a Hub contract and we have special code tied to it. Let me know if you find any evidence showing otherwise.

Wayne,

Do you have this contract defined as a HUB contract? I thought that we showed this as a FTS-1 HUB agreement. Please let me know. Also don't you have  specific hard coding tied to the HUB contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Should Cr 24954 (The Northwest Capacity in the Hub) be and FTS-1 contract or should it be an Administrative contract?

It is currently set up as an FTS-1.

Please advise...
