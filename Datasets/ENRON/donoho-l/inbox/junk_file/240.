Lindy, 

Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is a draft presentation for credit agencies regarding TW.  Please take a look at it and provide me with your comments.  In particular, I have designated some pages that I think you can help me with, see below.  Please feel free to comment on the rest of the presentation too.

Thanks,

Michael
