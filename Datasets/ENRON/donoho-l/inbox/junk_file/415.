Lindy,
I have made a few suggestions to your letter please review, I wanted to make clear that TW would accept nominations as usual but it would be SoCal's decision to only confirm beginning at the evening cycle. I hope it did not add a negative connotation to your letter because I know you want it to be positive so do not feel obligated to use my suggestions.
I have talked to Mary Draemer about the EDI issue and she will give me a date that TW can start accepting confirmations from SoCal via EDI for the Topock point. Before EDI starts the point could be manually confirmed. 

 


Thanks: John Buchanan
