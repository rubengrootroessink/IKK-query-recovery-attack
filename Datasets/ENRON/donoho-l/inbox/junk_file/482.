Welcome to this week's Eyeforenergy Update.  Just to refresh your memories,
this update is sent to you, alternating each week with the main Eyeforenergy
Briefing to let you know of any developments on the Eyeforenergy.com
website, including publication of new stories, whitepapers and special
features, as well as the latest news on our upcoming conferences.

If you visit our homepage www.eyeforenergy.com, you will see that our newest
Featured Content is a special report, commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA and
produced by the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research
- Oslo.  This takes a look at the current status of climate negotiations and
the Kyoto agreement, particularly after COP7 towards the end of last year.
It's most interesting aspect for Eyeforenergy readers is how it takes a look
at implications for business in terms of compliance, mechanisms and funding,
even for countries which have chosen not to ratify Kyoto such as the USA.
Scroll down the page to read the full report...

On the same subject, early discounted registration is now available for our
CO2 Trading: The North American Market conference, 18-20 June in Chicago,
which already has companies such as DuPont, Entergy, TransAlta, Natsource,
Entergy and Cinergy on board.  Look out for the full program for this event,
which will be published on our website tomorrow.  We can also announce that
the number of industries who will be talking about their energy management
strategies for the first time at Strategy Energy Management USA is growing,
including the likes of International Paper, North Star Steel, Nestl? and
more.  Keep an Eye on future Eyeforenergy Updates for more information as it
becomes available.

Lastly, we are now taking early no-obligation applications for our
forthcoming members only Premium Content subscription area, which will
entitle you to a discount off the already very low price.  See down for
further details...

NEW WHITEPAPER

An evaluation of business implications of the Kyoto Protocol

This report was originally commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA, and it's aim is
to present and analyze the newest developments in the climate negotiations,
particularly the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention
in Marrakech, Morocco, in October/November 2001, and to provide an
evaluation of what the finalized Kyoto Protocol means for business.

Eyeforenergy thanks and acknowledges the author Dr Asbj?rn Torvanger
(asbjorn.torvanger@cicero.uio.no) and CICERO (Center for International
Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo), on whose website it was
originally presented.

Energy Management has never been more important than today. As the energy

increasingly faced with new players, new tools and new choices. A solid
strategy which can navigate the challenges of intense competition, online
developments and a volatile market supply is crucial to your business.

This June in Philadelphia, and for the first time ever, all the major
industries will be discussing their energy management strategies.
International Paper, North Star Steel, the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia and Nestl? are just some of the companies who will outline how
they purchase and manage their energy supplies. If you are involved in
energy procurement, make sure you're in Philadelphia this June at the
Strategic Energy Management USA conference and exhibition.
