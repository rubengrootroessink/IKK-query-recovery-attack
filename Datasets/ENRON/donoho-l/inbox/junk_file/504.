RE: TWO NEW PIPELINE REPORTS


Lippman Consulting, Inc. is proud to announce that it has expanded it's 
monthly pipeline reports by adding two new pipelines. The two new systems are 
the Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company and  the CMS Trunkline Gas 
Company. Both of these two new reports will contain the same detailed 
information on the major receipts and deliveries along these pipelines as our 
clients have grown to expect. With these two reports, we have completed our 
coverage of the Rocky Mountain region and expanding our coverage of the Gulf 
Coast region. Over the next few months, our clients will see continuing 
expansion of our pipeline reporting coverage in the Gulf Coast region.   

The cost for either one of these reports is $110 per month on an annual 
subscription or the reports can be purchased on a one-time basis for $330. As 
a reminder, our Retainer Clients will receive these new reports at no 
additional charge. If you would like additional information on our Retainer 
Client services or to order the report, please feel free to contact me by 
e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.
