If you could help me with a couple of pieces we will be moving in the right direction.     I am looking for a history of TW and some basic overview stuff.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.
