Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona
