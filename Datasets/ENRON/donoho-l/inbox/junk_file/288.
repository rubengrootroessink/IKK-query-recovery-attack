500390	Sum WTG Delivery Pt 			Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.
