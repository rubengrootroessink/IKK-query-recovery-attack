<B>Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh 
Annual Spring Conference:  Power Markets 2002: Risk 
and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in 
Las Vegas, Nevada.</B><p>

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming 
on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise 
dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will 
continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps 
more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will 
continue, and risk management techniques will continue 
to be honed. <p>

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and 
thrive in 2002!
