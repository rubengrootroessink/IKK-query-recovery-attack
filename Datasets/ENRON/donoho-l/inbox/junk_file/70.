Lindy and I just discussed this and there may be others; Lindy mentioned expansion deals that may contain MDQ and term stipulations in construction letters, etc...   She's checking...

Bill Rapp requested copies of contracts that deviated from our GISB boiler plate contracts.  He was to review them and determine whether he needed to include them in a project he was working on.  Josh delivered copies of the ones Craig identified below to him on Friday afternoon so I do not think you need to do anything.

Craig,
	What is the definition of "non-standard" for your purposes?  Give me a call to discuss and I'll verify. (X36007)
Thanks!
Lindy
