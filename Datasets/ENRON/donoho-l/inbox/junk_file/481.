NEW REMAINING RESERVE REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is proud to announce that is has just completed a 
new Lower 48 States Dry Remaining Reserve Report. This report lists annually 
the reserves, additions, revisions and production as well as the reserve life 
index for the period 1990 through 2000. The data for this report was obtained 
from the EIA and is shown in both a table and graphical form. LCI has 
captured the data and summarized the report into the 8 separate producing 
regions that we have used for all our other production reports. Individual 
charts and tables are provided for each of the separate regions. The report 
quickly gives the reader an excellent overview of the historical activities 
that have been underway in each of the regions. It highlights the growth of 
some regions and the significant declines in other regions. Historical 
reserve life index over the period for each region is provided to inform the 
reader of the producing ability of that region.  

The cost for the report is $300.  If you would like additional information or 
to order the report, please feel free to contact me by e-mail at 
Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.
