 Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Res=
ources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and T=
ransportation System   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    PHOENIX, Jan. =
10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation Syste=
m (Desert Crossing) is holding an Open Season for customers interested in c=
apacity, beginning today and extending through Feb. 8, 2002.     Open Seaso=
n is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas stora=
ge capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeli=
ne, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purcha=
se the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing sy=
stem will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas =
storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, no=
rth of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 mil=
es from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an=
 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage comple=
x with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and sou=
thern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com =
).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and=
 trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Proj=
ect (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE =
), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-respons=
ive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwest=
ern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on na=
tural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along =
with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region,=
 have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline pro=
ject attractive.     "As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeli=
ne configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consum=
ers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation cap=
acity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets," commented Michael Morrel=
l, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. "The increased storage and t=
ransportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective pr=
ices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas."      S=
RP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David =
Areghini, concurred.  "As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by addi=
ng new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability=
 to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossi=
ng project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consu=
mers and others in the Southwest for many years."     "The additional natur=
al gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, e=
specially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to=
 help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest," said Dwain Boettcher, v=
ice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. "The ho=
urly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to =
transform the way storage service is offered in the future."     Customers =
participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedent=
ed flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse ga=
s supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize thei=
r portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's e=
nergy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary reg=
ulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the =
Open Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of=
 the Open Season. To participate in the Open Season and for more informatio=
