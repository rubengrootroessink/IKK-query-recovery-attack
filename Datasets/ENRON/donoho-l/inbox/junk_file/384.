Please disregard this TW business plan that was distributed on Saturday - this did not pick up the changes that were made.  I will resend the correct version.

Attached is a first draft of the TW business plan requested by Stan.  There are a few remaining items that can be cleaned up on Monday, however, Rod, if Stan would like to see this now, it is in pretty good shape.  I also want to thank everyone for their input into this process.  The ten year forecast was (hopefully!) finalized last night -  I will circulate that as well after I get a chance to review it.  
thanks,
Kevin
