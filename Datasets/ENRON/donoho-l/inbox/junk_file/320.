Rob and Lindy:
The two major areas that we are lacking for the TW business plan are Customers/contracts and Regulatory.  The attached power point presentation is a draft of a rating agency presentation that is being prepared and should be used as a guide for the narratives.  Since we are under a tight deadline on these business plans, I would very much appreciate it if you both could draft the narrative for your respective areas based upon the attached presenation.  The "story" in the presentation just needs to be translated to a narrative form - one that is in a "offering memorandum" format.  If we could get these by tomorrow mid day would be great.
Thanks,

Kevin
