The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.
