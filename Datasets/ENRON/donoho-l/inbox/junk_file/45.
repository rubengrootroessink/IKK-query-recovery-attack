Please plan to attend a meeting on Thursday, January 17, 2002 at 8:30 AM in Conf. Rm. 1336 to discuss Transwesterns position on PG&E's Plan of Reorganization.  In particular they have requested our support of their filing at FERC (Docket No. CP02-41) to convert their backbone system into an interstate pipeline (GTrans).  Interventions in this docket are due January 29th.  Below is the link to PG&E's home page location with a summary of their proposal.  Should you have any other questions or need additional data, please advise.  gh
