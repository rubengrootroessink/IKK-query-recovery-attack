Looks good to me.  

Should John Duschinske and Greg Porter be listed on the officers for Transwestern?

As I mentioned in the staff meeting, please find attached for your review and comment the first draft of TW's Section 7(c) application requesting Commission authorization to certificate the addition of 10,000 Dth/day of capacity on Transwestern's San Juan lateral.  Also, please note that the exhibit section is not complete in this draft.  
thanks for your assistance      - kelly
