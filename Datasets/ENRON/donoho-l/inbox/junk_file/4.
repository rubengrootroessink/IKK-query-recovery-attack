T.K., Lindy,

I have set up new groups for TW in the PLE system that emulate the templets in CBS.  I would like to get together with you and review the lists or give you a copy and have you review them.  Do you have some time this afternoon for me to come down with the lists?  Let me know.

Thanks

Linda
