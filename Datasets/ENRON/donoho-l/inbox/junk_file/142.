RE: NORTH AMERICAN REGIONAL FLOWS


Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has expanded the 
Western North American Supply Movement report and renamed it the North 
American Regional Flows. We have divided North American into 16 regional 
areas including Canada and Mexico. This monthly report will capture the 
volumes flowing from region to region. At this time we have complete data on 
the flows for regions 1 through 8 and incomplete data for flows from regions 
9 through 12. As we expand our pipeline coverage, we will continually update 
this report with our expanded coverage. Attached for your review, is the 
update map showing flow for the month of December, 2001. The full report also 
contains a data base with three years of historical flow for each of the 
points shown on the map.    

The cost for this report is $160 per month on an annual subscription or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $480. If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman, 
President
