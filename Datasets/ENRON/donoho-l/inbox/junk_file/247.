I would bring 10 copies of the valuation page, assumptions page, financial statements (annual), expansion pages, revenue back up.  Anything else?

Here we are.  If something is glaringly off, I will have my cell & pager, I'm going to grab some lunch.  Cell is 7/303.1297.

Key assumptions -$200mm new equity in '03 to fund $300mm in expansions.  Debt reaches 50/50 cap ratio by '04.  reduced ltd to $500 in '02.

The average ROIC as you get out in the future is on the order of 7%, which is greater than the wacc, so there is reasonableness to the positive valuation.

Please advise how we should prepare to present.
