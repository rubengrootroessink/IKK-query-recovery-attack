An emergency change control has been submitted for implementation this weekend...

Oct.   13	From 12:00 - 1:00 p.m., Telephony Services will reboot the back-up processor on the Cajun ATM Network.  This change is necessary to alleviate dropped calls in EB, ECS and 3AC due to an unstable environment on the back-up processor.   No impact is expected.
