Attached are the spreadsheets which show the amount of gas which should be nominated as payment for electricity provided to the Gallup Compressor.  The amount nominated for Bisti is a constant 8106 mmbtu/day each month.  Therefore the total daily amount for 
December was 11692 mmbtu/day and the total for January was 11668.

  

Thanks,
Amy
