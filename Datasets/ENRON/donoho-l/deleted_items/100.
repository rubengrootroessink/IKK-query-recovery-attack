Randy, Stephanie asked me to send this to you.  Is this correct with your records?

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy
