How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team has contacted Webmasters with content or applications on the following ETS websites: http://home.ets.enron.com and http://home.ops.ets.enron.com to discuss the migration.    If you have content or applications on this server and have not been contacted, please call LaDonna Dervin as soon as possible.
