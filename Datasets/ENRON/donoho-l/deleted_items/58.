Today is the final day to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award.  Today is your last opportunity to nominate that special coworker who represents Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  

Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past may be nominated again this year.  Also, there is no limit to the number of nominations you submit. 

Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by the end of the business day today. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com.  In Houston, forms are available in the elevator lobbies as well. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your prompt attention and participation.

Stan
