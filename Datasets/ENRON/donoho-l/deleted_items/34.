Remember to join Enron Global Services Chairman & CEO Stan Horton on an eSpeak session Thursday, October 18 at 10 a.m. Houston time where he will answer questions regarding the new EGS. This is a great opportunity to get first hand information about what's going on within EGS and throughout Enron. 

If you can't make the live event, don't sweat it.  Go to http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp, and submit your question(s) today.  Stan will try to answer your questions during his "open mike" session, and you can read the transcript whenever you get the opportunity. 

Don't miss this opportunity to hear it straight from the top.
