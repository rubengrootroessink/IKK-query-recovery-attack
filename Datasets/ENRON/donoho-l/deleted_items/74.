Linda,

I am going through your list & should be able to send you the updates by the COB Tuesday or Wednesday. Most of these are accounting related reports that will be addressed with the rates and revenue project. 
Thanks Ramona

Could each of you review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS reports and let me know by Friday 1/11/02 which of the reports are being used and which are not.  Several of the reports have not been run for years.

Thanks

Linda

Linda,

Could you please have someone review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS Reports and Jobs and verify from the business perspective whether the reports/jobs still need to be functional in the CBS system once we transition to the CMS system?  Do the best you can.  Indicate for each item whether it is needed or obsolete.  David generated the list from current CBS information as of 11/12/2001.  It is my fault this did not get reviewed earlier.  This will help him as he designed the backfeed that will keep the accounting portions of CBS going.  If you are not sure of the need for certain reports, leave them blank and indicate to the right who might know this information in the business area.

Thanks!

ab.
