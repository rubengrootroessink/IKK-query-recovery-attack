Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the 3 rd quarter of 2001 San Juan 
Basin production report. This report contains historical gas volumes that are 
separated out by conventional and coal seam properties. The report also 
separates the production by each contributing state.  Volumes are reported 
annually as well as quarterly for the past 10 years.  The report contains 
charts and graphs depicting various historical statistics including the gas 
production volumes, number of new wells drilled each year and monthly rig 
activity. The data clearly shows that the San Juan Basin  production has 
peaked and is now on a decline.     

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information on this report or on any of our other reports, please 
feel free to contact me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 
915-581-1668.
