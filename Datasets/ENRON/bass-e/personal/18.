The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian
