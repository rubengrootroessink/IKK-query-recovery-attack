Dear eric,




ROCKETS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE MAVS SATURDAY

After trailing the Lakers by 15 points in the third quarter of last night's game, the Rockets needed a lift. They turned to the sold-out Compaq Center crowd and got what they were looking for. 

With the house-a-rockin', Steve, Cuttino and the gang led a furious second-half Rockets rally spurred by the energy of the sold-out arena. Although the comeback fell just short, the fans' support was a certain factor in the rally.

The Rockets will be looking for the same support Saturday when Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks pay a visit to Compaq Center for a Texas Showdown. Game time is 7:30 p.m.
