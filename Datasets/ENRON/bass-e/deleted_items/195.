Eric

Thanks for the invite but I will be unable to attend.  That is my first 
weekend of this semester and I am sure I will have a load of crap to handle.

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our 
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 
2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the 
bachelor party.

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the 
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) 
called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about 
$50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or 
$35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would 
prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not 
included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would 
like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric
