just got my ticket to h-town this weekend.  i wouldn't
miss this shalacking (?) for the world.  i'm already
ready to drink. 

hope everything goes well for you guys at ene.  while
i'm happy to have left, it sucks to know that some
friends might not have a job in a shitty time to not
have a job.  i heard you gas traders are alright
though since you're the only ones who made money for
enron.  i'm referring to my egm and ees peeps.
