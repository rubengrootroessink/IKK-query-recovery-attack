Hi Folks,

Getting an avalanche of email on this so thought I'd share my thoughts on
how I see this Jimmy Smith business shaking out.   This is strictly my
opinion here.

First off, I'll stay totally out of the issue of casting any moral
judgements.   That's not my place and that's not why you subscribe.   I'm
only interested (because I know YOU'RE primarily interested) in how this
affects his Fantasy Football status.

I could care less about a fine.   The real issue is whether the league could
take action in the form of a suspension.   It's my opinion that this is
highly unlikely to happen this season.   For a number of reasons.

First, Smith is widely regarded as one of the league's "Good Guys".   Rest
assured, the NFL is first and foremost, a business and like any business,
the league takes it's image very seriously.   There's a reason big bucks are
spent on all the (outstanding) feel good commercials featuring players
lately.   Smith is known as a good guy with lots of charity work.   Plus, he
has the amazing story regarding his health this summer.   He's a poster guy.
It's my understanding that this is a first time offense for him.   The fact
that a respected coach like Tom Coughlin is staunchly behind him helps.   By
far, the best Public Relations move for the league is that this be swept
under the rug.

Secondly, there's the evidence itself.   While the NFL has a pretty large
(and vague) "Good of the League" directive to work within, the evidence of a
urine test seems sketchy to me.   Especially as it was not administered by
the league.   There is of course the possibility for false positives in such
a test.   An even bigger factor in Smith's favor is that he will not be
charged with any crime.

Thirdly, is the timing.   I doubt the league is in any hurry to throw the
book at Smith.   Any action that might result would likely be something that
is carefully weighed with the ever present thought of the league protecting
itself from litigation.   Therefore, even if something serious were to arise
from this, I have a hard time seeing it happening within the next few weeks.
Not to be too callous about our game of Fantasy Football, but I honestly
care a lot more about this between now and week 17.   I'd be surprised to
see some sort of swift action taken.

Bottom line:   If I were a Jimmy Smith owner, I believe I'd sit tight.
While embarrassing, I don't see a lot of real live jeopardy there for him.
That's my opinion.   If you had a Smith owner in your league who is
panicking over this, I would have no problem letting him believe what he
chooses to believe and maybe scooping up Smith if the price is very
attractive.   Again, just my thoughts.

Thanks to our friend Tom Kessinich from Krause Publications for letting me
bounce some of these things off him.

Have a great week.

Joe
