ROCKETS GUARD TO SHARE BACKCOURT WITH BRYANT 

  <http://origin.nba.com/media/allstar2002/francis_drive_020125.jpg>Jan. 26 - Houston Rockets guard Steve Francis today was named as a starter for the Western Conference in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game to be played in Philadelphia on February 10. 

Francis will join Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in the backcourt along with Tim Duncan of the Spurs, L.A.'s Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves in the Western Conference frontcourt.

The Rockets point guard, who will be making his inaugural All-Star appearance, held the second position among Western Conference guards when the first returns of the 2002 All-Star balloting were announced last month. He maintained that position throughout the process, easily outdistancing Seattle's Gary Payton for the starting nod.
