IRVING, Texas (AP) Emmitt Smith will return to the Dallas Cowboys' lineup
Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right
knee.

Coach Dave Campo said after practice Friday that Smith would "be ready to
play the majority of the game."

Smith returned to practice Thursday and was back on the field Friday. He was
hurt during the Cowboys' 17-3 win over Arizona on Oct. 28 when he was
tackled after a 1-yard gain in the final two minutes.

Smith, the NFL's second-leading career rusher, did not speak with reporters.

Before missing consecutive games for the first time in his 12-year NFL
career, Smith had missed only two other games because of injury - one in
1994 and another five years later.

Smith has 15,564 career yards rushing, 1,162 behind Walter Payton's NFL
record.

Troy Hambrick, who rushed for 204 yards while replacing Smith in losses to
the New York Giants and Atlanta, will start at fullback.

Doesn't make a lot of sense to me with Hambrick playing the way he does but
far be it from me to try and figure out Jerry Jones.   Emmitt has paid the
dues and has earned the start I suppose when he's healthy.   Bottom line is
put a heavy downgrade on Hambrick for now.
