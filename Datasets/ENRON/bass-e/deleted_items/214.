Sounds good to me. Count me in. I will do the "gourmet" dinner if that is
what the rest want to do. What do you have in mind about transportation to
and from the ship? A designated driver, rent a limo/van, mules? Love-Dad

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb.
2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the
bachelor party.

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston)
called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about
$50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or
$35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would
prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not
included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would
like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric
