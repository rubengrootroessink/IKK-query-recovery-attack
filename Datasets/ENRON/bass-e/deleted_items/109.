Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Beer! Banjos! Bock! Bluegrass!   
If you love bluegrass, the Grateful Dead, or both, this is the event for you.  If you loved the soundtrack to "Deliverance" but could do without the "Squeal like a pig", this is the event for you.  If you look forward to the rollout of Spring Bock every year, this is the event for you.  If you like yummy Tex-Mex, this is the event for you. 

This Friday night, January 18 at the Garden in the Heights, the Yonder Mountain String Band will be performing (inside the Beer Hall in all likelihood).  This band takes bluegrass to a new level and has been known to jam on one song for an hour.  They just sold out the Fillmore in San Francisco (the Mecca of Bluegrass - OK, perhaps not, but they do like good music there) two nights in a row.  Come out and join us (overalls not necessary).  This email is good for $2 off the admission ticket. 

When: Friday, January 18 
Time: 6:30  Doors open 
      7:00  Billy Bright Band (opening act) 
      9:00  Yonder Mountain String Band (they're doing 2 sets - you'll get your moneys' worth) 
Where: Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan 
Admission: $10 with this email, otherwise $12 at the door 
Food: Tex-Mex available, catered by a fine restaurant (where the Yonder Mountain String Band played their Last Concert) 

Last Chance on Cigar Night 
We have just a few spaces left.  Here's the info.  For reservations, please call the brewery or email dan@saintarnold.com.   

Admission: $20 (includes the two cigars)  
Date: Wednesday, January 23 
Time: 6 pm - 9 pm  
Where: Saint Arnold Brewery 
       2522 Fairway Park Dr. 


If anyone was supposed to receive his/her Hopwaiian shirt and has not, please let us know.  It's the ultimate beer fashion accessory!  Christian Dior wants to license the design from us for their show in Milan. 

Also, please forward this to any friends on AOL, because AOL blocks our email missives (even though we don't spam).  Anyone with connections to AOL that can get us past this hurdle, please let us know!  Thanks for your support!
