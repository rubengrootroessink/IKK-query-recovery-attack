Some of you are still alive and playing in your Championship this 
week.  Some of you completed their seasons last week or before.  For 
those still alive, here is the news that you need to know:

General News:

Tampa Bay is expected to rest a lot of players in this game.  They do 
not need the game and will likely sit Warrick Dunn.  Brad Johnson and 
Keyshawn Johnson may play only a half.  Doug Brien will also give 
Martin Gramatica another week to heal.  

Pittsburgh will likely rest some of their players this week  Jerome 
Bettis could start, but probably will not.  Hines Ward and Kordell 
Stewart may only play a half.  Don't expect Kordell to take off
on many runs this week either.

Philadelphia is expected to rest the majority of their stars.  Chad 
Lewis and James Thrash are not expected to play.  Duce Staley may 
play.  Donovan McNabb is likely to only to play a half.

The Rams will either be full throttle or resting their stars.  If 
Chicago wins, expect Warner and Faulk to be huge.  If Chicago loses, 
both could be spelled this week.

And now onto the individual players:

to play.  He appears on the injury report as doubtful with a sore 
elbow.  Michael Vick will start in his place.

decision.  If he cannot go, Jake Reed will start opposite of Randy 
Moss.

Randy Moss (Min) hasn't done anything stupid this week?yet.

Terry Glenn (NE) was given Wednesday off for personal reasons.  I am 
guessing he needs a lot more days off.  Glenn practiced on Thursday 
and will play as the #3 WR this week.

Jerry Rice (Oak) is away from the team to be with his ailing father.

expected to play.

not be able to go on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as
