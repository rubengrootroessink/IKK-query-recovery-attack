INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts will place wide receiver Jerome
Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday.

Team president Bill Polian said Monday night that Pathon will undergo
surgery ``sometime soon'' to repair a damaged ligament in his right foot.

The move will end Pathon's fourth NFL season. The Colts did not announce how
they would fill Pathon's roster spot.

Pathon sprained his right foot near the end of the third game of the season,
a 44-13 loss at New England. He aggravated the injury during warmups before
the Colts played Miami on Nov. 11. Polian said a further examination last
week revealed more damage to the foot.

Pathon earned the starting job opposite two-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin
Harrison, and was having the best season of his career. He set career highs
for receptions and receiving yards in each of the Colts' first two games,
and was the team's leading receiver through three games.

He missed four games before returning against Miami.

Pathon tried to practice last Wednesday. But Polian said the receiver had a
setback before missing Sunday's game at New Orleans.

Pathon finishes the season with 24 receptions for 330 yards and two
touchdowns.

And the hits just keep on rollin' for Indy.   Terrence Wilkins and Reggie
Wayne should benefit as should TE Marcus Pollard.   Tough break for Pathon
who was having a great start.

Thanks to Footballguy Chuck Bailey for pointing me to this one.
