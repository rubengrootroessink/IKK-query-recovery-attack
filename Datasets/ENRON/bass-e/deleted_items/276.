NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair missed
practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back spasms and is
questionable for Saturday's game against Oakland.

"There are concerns," coach Jeff Fisher said. "He hasn't responded like we'd
hoped. He's still pretty stiff."

McNair first experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In
the first quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles
tightened up. However, he stayed in the game and led the Titans to a 26-20
victory.

Even McNair is unsure of his status for Saturday night.

"If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it," he said. "I'm
very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the spasms have
stayed longer than I anticipated."

McNair has been questionable numerous times this season with shoulder,
ankle, thumb and elbow injuries. However, he missed just one game, and is
now producing the best statistics of his career.

**********  Our View  **************

Jeff Fisher is probably the least forthcoming of any NFL coach outside of
Mike Shanahan.   Clearly, it doesn't sound good.   But McNair is a guy who
seems to always be a stretch to play and then he goes out and does well (at
least lately)   I honestly don't have any more info that what's reported
above.   It would be my suggestion that if you have a good alternative, you
look hard at him as it's awfully murky for McNair right now.
