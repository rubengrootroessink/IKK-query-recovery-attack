Garcia Throws, but Still Questionable

BY DENNIS GEORGATOS
Mercury News

Quarterback Jeff Garcia tested his sore ribs Thursday, briefly running plays
and passing during the 49ers' team drills on a rain-soaked practice field.

Backup Tim Rattay still handled the bulk of the practice snaps and Garcia
remains questionable for Saturday's game at 3Com Park against the
Philadelphia Eagles.

Coach Steve Mariucci said he was encouraged by Garcia's outing but the
quarterback's playing status could be a game-time decision.

``I didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing,'' Mariucci said.
``I saw him throw a couple of frozen ropes in there. We didn't overdo it
with him. We'll see. I don't know what to predict but he's making some
progress. The important thing will be how it feels'' today.

Garcia, who has started the past 34 games for the 49ers, tore rib-cage
cartilage when he was tackled Sunday during a 21-0 victory over the Miami
Dolphins.

``I felt pretty good in throwing the ball in our 7-on-7 period,'' Garcia
said. ``I didn't want to make it any worse. But I was able to practice and
felt good about that. I felt crisp and I felt sharp. And it made me more
confident as far as going into Saturday.''

If Garcia is unable to play, Rattay would make his first NFL start. Rattay
has thrown one pass in his two-year NFL career.

If Rattay does start because of Garcia's injury, Rick Mirer could be his
backup. Garcia still could be available in an emergency as the third
quarterback.

************* Our View **************

Another sketchy call here.  It's encouraging news but still a game time
decision.   It's pretty much the same advice as with Steve McNair:  If you
have a good backup, I'd go there.   Garcia could play, but there is
definitely the chance he sits and you probably can't risk a zero from your
QB.

More if we hear it.   Thanks to Footballguy Bob Albright, Jr for pointing me
to this one.
