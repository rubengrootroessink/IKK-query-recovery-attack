Thought you might find the attached article interesting. I called SCCC. Cannot get a tee time for Tuesday until Sunday. I will call then. It is ladies day, which means the earliest tee time will be noon. I will get the tee time as close to noon as available. If you only have 3 players, I will join you if you do not mind. Love-Dad
