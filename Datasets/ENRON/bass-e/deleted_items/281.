Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=133462&"><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1152&"><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=12436&"><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>, RB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the <I>Nashville Tennessean</I>
. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=133462&"><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1070&"><B>Gus Frerotte</B></A>, QB DEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT></FONT><BR>

He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1681&"><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1025&"><B>Scott Mitchell</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=133415&"><B>Akili Smith</B></A>
, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1177&"><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. N!
on!
e of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT>

While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1645&"><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=235069&"><B>Bill Gramatica</B></A>, K ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the team's placekicker. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=187388&"><B>Bubba Franks</B></A>, TE GB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/17/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>

Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Boston had eight catches for 84 yards on Saturday against the N.Y. Giants. Boston was held out of the end zone, but he's still one of the best Fantasy receivers in the game. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1440&"><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, Active RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR>
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. <BR>

Moulds has been an up-and-down player this year. He might have trouble getting open against Ty Law. <BR>

Look for Dyson to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He might not score, but should catch a lot of passes. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=12429&"><B>Matt Hasselbeck</B></A>, Reserve QB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/14/01</FONT><BR>
Hasselbeck may not do much against the Dallas defense. The Cowboys' defense has been solid against the pass, and Hasselbeck has been erratic in his first year as a starter.<BR>

Brown should get in the end zone this week. The Bills will have trouble handling him in the open field. <BR>

Ismail has been a solid receiver but could struggle this week against a tough Steelers defense. Consider benching him this week if you have another receiver with a better matchup. <BR>

Williams was held to only 41 yards rushing on Sunday, but he did score his seventh touchdown of the year. Williams is a solid Fantasy tailback, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. <BR>

Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don?t depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.<BR>

Jones scored a touchdown last week against Oakland, but he's still not seeing enough carries to warrant Fantasy consideration. Unless you're desperate and in a deeper league, there's no reason to risk starting Jones in Week 13. <BR>

Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday. <BR>

Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. "I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals," Wilkins said. "It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks." <BR>
