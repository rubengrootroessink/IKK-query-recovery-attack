Hey there y'all.  Hope you had a Merry X-mas and a good New Year's Eve.
I just got back from Texas where I asked Marilyn to marry me (she said yes 
you wacko so don't even ask).  I updated the website with pics and a story 
on how it went down.

Hope you're all doin well, drop me a note when you get the chance.

Brett.
