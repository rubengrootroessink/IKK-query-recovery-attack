Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=27&>, DT SEA - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. "If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week," Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1296&>, WR KC - FIBSABs Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards ! an! d one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=12797&>, QB STL - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta. "They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine," Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. "They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords," Warner said. "It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit." Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1294&> , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. "It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain," Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game." Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Rocks Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1262&>, WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1254&>, WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had ! to! attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1511&>, WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Klap Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. "Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury," General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. "The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look." Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Further! t! ests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1387&>, K JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1116&>, RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. "I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know," Davis said. "I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe." Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1383&>, K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. "I've met every goal that I had coming into the season," Elam said. "I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better." Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent. 

T.J. Houshmandzadeh <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=235086&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Houshmandzadeh left Sunday's game against Tennessee with a sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, however, and the injury isn't considered very serious. 

Dez White <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
White (hamstring) was inactive for Sunday's game against Jacksonville. However, he expects to be ready for the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. 

Wesley Walls <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Walls will have reconstructive surgery on his left knee on Monday, and is expected to be ready for the start of the 2002 season. However, the Charlotte Observer is reporting that Walls likely won't be back in Carolina next year. The veteran tight end could be made available for the expansion draft, or may be released from the team altogether. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Van Pelt suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's 34-7 loss to Miami. "I'm a little sore," Van Pelt told the Buffalo News. "I think what happened is basically the shoulder came out of the capsule in the back. It's nothing too serious, but when I tried to throw on the sidelines, I didn't have any strength." Van Pelt later stated that doctors expect his shoulder to be completely healthy in between six-to-eight weeks. 

Michael Bennett <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 01/06/02
Bennett was not limited in practice Friday due to a sore heel, and should be able to play Monday against Baltimore. He's still a very risky start against the tough Ravens rush defense.

Martin Gramatica <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=133297&>, K TB - Fear Updated 01/06/02
The Bucs are expected to rest Gramatica this week due to a hamstring injury. Doug Brien will likely handle the kicking duties Sunday against Philadelphia, but we don't recommend you use either player in Week 17.

Jerry Rice <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/06/02
Rice returned to practice Friday after spending time with his ailing father during the week. He plans to play Sunday against the Jets.

Alge Crumpler <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 01/06/02
Crumpler will start Sunday's game against St. Louis as a result of an injury to Reggie Kelly. Crumpler, who has been somewhat useful in recent weeks, could be worth using in Week 17.

Tommy Maddox <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1005&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/06/02
Maddox took extra snaps in practice this week and could replace Kordell Stewart as early as halftime Sunday in order to keep the latter healthy for the playoffs. We don't recommend you use either player based on their abbreviated playing time.

James McKnight <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Baja Updated 01/06/02
McKnight practiced Friday and will play Sunday. He has been recovering from the effects of a concussion.

Fred Taylor <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2362&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 01/06/02
Jaguars Head Coach Tom Coughlin declared Taylor out for Sunday's game against Chicago due to the groin strain that has kept him out since Sept. 23. He appeared in just two games this season, and you'll need to monitor his progress over the offseason before considering drafting him in 2002.
