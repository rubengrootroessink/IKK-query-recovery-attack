PROS Revenue Management's Web Seminar: 


Energy Profit Optimization for Natural Gas Trading

 
January 29, 2002-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, invites you to its web seminar spotlighting natural gas trading profit optimization, will be hosted on February 7th, 3:00 - 4:00pm Central Time.
 
Executives from the world's most forward-thinking companies have already registered to attend the seminar.  This seminar is of particular interest because it will address the broader applicability of revenue optimization, which has proven to be a "significantly effective competitive device" in industries where it has been deployed effectively.  PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.  This Web seminar will allow industry leaders to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 17 years of deploying these solutions.
 
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process.  The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use since 2000.  Version 2.0 of the TOS system has been completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.  The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.
 
The seminar will address topics critical to understand how revenue optimization can be deployed in specific environments, including the following:
How revenue optimization works, 
How to estimate the potential value of a revenue optimization system, 
What is required for a successful revenue optimization initiative, and
Examples of revenue optimization success
