Good evening my friends:
 
Bob Hebert is running for County Judge of Fort Bend County. The incumbent will not run for health reasons. The incumbent will support Bob.
 
I know of no one in Fort Bent County more qualified to be County Judge than Bob. If elected, he will do a fine job and the citizens impacted will be better off with him in that position.
 
He needs your help. Money is more important than anything. This is a short race and time is precious. The election is in the first week of March.
 
If you are willing to make a donation(any amount will be appreciated), please make your check (no corporate checks, please) payable to the Robert E. Hebert Campaign and send it to me @ Suite 560, 9800 Richmond Ave., Houston 77042. I will see that Bob knows of your support.
 
You will also be invited to a fund raiser on Jan. 29 to meet and visit with Bob.
 
If you have any questions please either give me a call or e-mail. Thanks for your support.-Larry W. Bass
