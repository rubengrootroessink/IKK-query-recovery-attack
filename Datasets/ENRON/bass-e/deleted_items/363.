no, no more motorcycles.  i'm working for an engineering consulting firm
near the galleria, and i really enjoy it.  i've been here several months,
and it seems to fly by.  my lease was up at the gables at the end of
october, so i have been looking for a townhouse for the last couple of
months.  i've found several i like, but none i'm extremely crazy about.  for
thanksgiving, i went and delivered food for meals on wheels with Oma, and
then ate with my family.  it was really nice.  the girls are so grown up
now!  mom and dad are getting along better than ever!  i got some of my
christmas shopping done over the weekend as well.  other than that, not too
much else going on in my life. for once in my life, i feel as though i don't
have much stress.  it is actually a wonderful feeling!  what about you?
where are you living, etc?
