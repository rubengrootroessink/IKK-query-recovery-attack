Dear icruise member,
Things are settling down and all over the country it seems, people are
looking to get back to their lives. A New Year and a new start, what
can be more American. We see it in the demand for cruises, and folks
inventory is already tightening up.

This week FLASH brings you something new, something familiar and
something unusual. How about the Norwegian Sea for 13 days from
Miami to New York via the Caribbean for just $1,082 including FREE
air and port charges! In familiar territory, the Carnival Spirit beckons to
have fun, sailing to the Southern Caribbean for 8 days and only $751.
The brand sparkling new Radiance of the Seas also awaits you for
7 days to beautiful Alaska for just $1,012 port included, of course!

Alex Aliksanyan
President/CEO
PS. If you had 27,000 icruiseMiles on your icruise credit card that 8 day Carnival cruise would be completely FREE!	 flashborder <http://www.i-cruise.com/flash/images/flas! h_sideheader.gif>
