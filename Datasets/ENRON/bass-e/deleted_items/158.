Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Got that January lethargy?  Experiencing post-holiday doldrums?  If so, you need to drink more St. Arnold's!  This elixir is known to create excitement in your life and can cure the common cold.  And here is a reminder about some events also sure put a smile on the face of even the biggest curmudgeon.

Looking for Christmas Ale? 
We have had some calls from people experiencing Christmas Ale withdrawal.  If you suffer from this ailment, we know of a couple of places with a few cases left.  We can't tell everyone where it is, but if you call or email us, we can tell you individually. 

Spread the Word 
You are the reason that we have experienced such strong growth this past year.  Most people find out about us because someone like you has told them about us (that's a lot of pronouns).  Please keep telling your friends.  Also, if you have a favorite restaurant/bar that doesn't carry our beer, let us know.  If you manage to sell it in, let us know and we will reward you! 

Anyone Seen our Cable TV Ads? 
We have been running some ads on the Optel/Showcase cable network.  We are curious if anyone has seen them.  If so, please let us know (along with any comments).  Did you suddenly experience the uncontrollable urge to open a cold St. Arnold? 

Thanks again for all your support, and remember to recycle your six pack carriers.   

Cheers,
