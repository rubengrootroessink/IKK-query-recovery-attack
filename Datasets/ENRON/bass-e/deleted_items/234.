Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1116&"><B>James Stewart</B></A>, RB DET - Tori Kuykendall <FONT SIZE=1>

Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least 200 yards and a touchdown. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1231&"><B>Marvin Harrison</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=12431&"><B>Donald Hayes</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1511&"><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.<BR>

Davis (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game. You should have no reservations about starting him against the Chiefs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1820&"><B>James Allen</B></A>, Active RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/09/01</FONT><BR>
According to published reports, Allen will split carries with Anthony Thomas on Sunday against Green Bay. Thomas is expected to start, but Allen will spell the rookie during the game. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=673&key=1676&"><B>Marcus Robinson</B></A>, Reserve WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 11/15/01</FONT><BR>
Robinson's prognosis for recovery from surgery to repair two ligaments in his left knee is seven to nine months. That would put him on target to return around the start of training camp next season, but you should check back on his status during the summer.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
