Congratulations!   If you're still reading this late in the season, 
you're likely in your playoffs (and well on your way to winning your 
league...)   We've said all along that it's you guys who make the 
site what it is.  We want to show our appreciation and give you guys 
some due props.   
 
Beginning Monday, we'll be accepting teams for display on our 
Footballguys Wall of Champions.   In this wacky season, making the 
playoffs is a feat in itself and we'll be displaying teams that make 
their playoffs as well as league winners.
 
Here's a chance to boast a little and rub it in the faces of your 
leaguemates who're on the sidelines watching as you battle for the 
league championship.
 
See the site for details.
 
Joe and David

and now onto the news:



Quarterbacks in the News:

Rob Johnson (Buf) is out.  

Scott Mitchell (Cin) injured himself in Wednesday's practice and
is now doubtful for this weekend.

Cincinnati has signed Scott Covington.  He will backup Jon Kitna this 
week.

Gus Frerotte (Den) has been placed on I/R and is out for the rest of 
the season.  In related news, the team signed Todd Husak for the 
remainder of the season.

Mark Brunell (Jac) is expected to practice on Thursday.  He appears 
on the injury report as probable with a sore quadriceps. 

Daunte Culpepper (Min) underwent surgery and is likely lost for the 
season.  Todd Bouman will start in his place.  He is nursing a 
sprained ligament in the thumb of his throwing hand, but is expected 
to play on Sunday. 

Jeff Garcia (SF) was held out of practice on Wednesday and may be 
rested this week.  He appears on the injury report as questionable 
with sore ribs.  Jeff would like to play, but coach Steve Mariucci is 
considering resting Jeff so that he is closer to 100% for the 
playoffs.  This would seem to make sense since the Rams have likely 
locked up winning the Division.  The 49ers believe they will need a 
healthy, scrambling Jeff Garcia to go deep into the post season.  If 
Jeff does not play, look for Tim Rattay to get the start.    

Steve McNair (Ten), despite being listed on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore back is expected to start.  

*******************************************

Running Backs in the News:

Maurice Smith (Atl) continues to battle through cartilage damage in 
his knee.  He is expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable.

Terry Allen (Bal) will start for the Ravens this week.  Moe Williams 
will back him up and see plenty of action. 

Jason Brookins (Bal) is out and will not play.

Shawn Bryson (Buf) will start this week.  Travis Henry is listed as 
out with a bad knee.  Sammy Morris will spell Shawn.

James Jackson (Cle) is out this week and is likely going to miss the 
remainder of the season with his bad ankle.  Jamel White and Ben Gay 
will both see duty in this week's game.

James Stewart (Det) practiced on Wednesday and likely will start on 
Sunday.

Ahman Green (GB) did not complete the full practice on Wednesday, but 
he is expected to play on Sunday.

Fred Taylor (Jac) continues to show up on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore groin, but do not look for him to play any 
time soon.  The injury is significantly worse than the team has let 
on.

Elvis Joseph (Jac) has a sore shoulder, but is expected to backup 
Stacey Mack.

Priest Holmes (KC) was excused from practice today.  He is expected 
to practice the rest of the week and will start on Sunday.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable with a pulled groin.

Rob Konrad (Mia) has a stiff neck, but is expected to play on 
Saturday against the Patriots.

Jim Kleinsasser (Min) will play through his sprained ankle.  

Ricky Williams (NO) is expected to start despite a hairline crack to 
one of his ribs.  He appears on the injury report as questionable.  

Jon Ritchie (Oak) is expected to play if needed.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a sore ankle.

Jerome Bettis (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is listed as 
doubtful on the injury report with a pulled groin.

Amos Zereoue (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is expected to 
contribute on Sunday as a backup to Chris Fuamatu Ma'afala
despite being listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.

Terrell Fletcher (SD) is out with a bad hamstring.  LaDainian 
Tomlinson will carry the running game like most weeks.

Warrick Dunn (TB) will play with turf toe.  He appears on the injury 
report as probable.

Skip Hicks (Ten) is expected to get significant playing time this 
week.  Eddie George will continue to start.

Stephen Davis (Was) did not practice on Wednesday.  He still is 
expected to start, but may be a gametime decision.  He appears on the 
injury report as questionable with a sore knee.  Proceed with caution.

*******************************************

Wide Receivers in the News:

Martay Jenkins (Ari) missed Wednesday's practice with bruised
ribs and a sprained ankle.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable and may be a gametime decision.

Brian Finneran (Atl) is expected to play despite a sore shoulder.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Terance Mathis (Atl) is expected to play through his back pain.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Peerless Price (Buf) was unable to practice Wednesday on his sore 
ankle.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a 
sprained ankle.  If he is unable to go, Reggie Germany would get the 
start opposite of Eric Moulds. 

Muhsin Muhammad (Car) skipped Wednesday's practice.  He will
likely be a gametime decision.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore toe.

Bert Emanuel (Det) completed the Wednesday practice and is expected

Harrison and Marcus Pollard are likely to get the majority of the

questionable to play Saturday.  He appears on the injury report as

expected to start in his place. 

James McKnight (Mia) has a sore back, but is expected to start 
opposite of Chris Chambers.  He is listed as probable on the injury 
report.

Cris Carter (Min) hinted to reporters that this is likely his final 
season in the NFL.  Of course he said all those things last year, but 
no one is now believing this team is very close to winning a 
Superbowl soon.   

Terry Glenn (NE) is expected to see increased playing time on 
Saturday.

Santana Moss (NYJ) was able to practice Wednesday, but is not likely 
to make a big impact this week.  He appears on the injury report as

remain the starters.

Sunday.

He appears on the injury report as probable.

James Thrash (Phi) is nursing sore ribs, but is expected to start as 
usual.  He appears on the injury report as probable.

Tim Dwight (SD) is out with Pneumothorax.  And No, I do not have a 
clue what that is.

few weeks.  He is expected to practice the rest of the week and start

Wednesday citing personal reasons.  He is expected to practice the 
rest of the week and play on Sunday.

in an effort to improve upon his accuracy.  He is not in any danger 
of losing his job despite poor performances as of late.
