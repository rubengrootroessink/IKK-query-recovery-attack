Dear eric,




HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO MEET MOOCHIE NORRIS!


Be sure to tune in to tonight's Rockets-Mavericks game on UPN 20 beginning at 7:30 p.m. for the chance to win a fabulous "Rockets Experience Package," featuring two tickets to the December 6 sold-out game against Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards, and the opportunity to meet Moochie Norris prior to the game.

 

During tonight's telecast on UPN 20, Rockets broadcasters Bill Worrell and Calvin Murphy will make an announcement advising viewers to phone a special number. The 20th caller will receive a "Rockets Experience Package" and the chance to see the Washington Wizards' only visit to Houston this season, plus have an individual photo taken with Moochie Norris at center court.
