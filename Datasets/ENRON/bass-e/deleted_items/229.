elieve that there are select sailings for as low as $199 per person for a t=
hree-day Nassau cruise or a seven-day eastern Caribbean cruise for only $39=
9 per person? Of course you are not going to get the best cabin at these pr=

cabins. The trick is to be flexible! One week, a seven-day cruise could sel=
l for $899 per person and the next week the same cruise could go for only $=
399 per person. Check out all of these short notice specials. This could be=
 your best value for 2002. Visit <http://www.cheapcruises.com> Remember, if=
 you're buying a cruise-only package and purchasing your airfare separately=
