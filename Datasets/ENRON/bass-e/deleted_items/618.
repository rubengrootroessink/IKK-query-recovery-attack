Dear Americans,

Well, it's that time of year again. The Holiday season is
upon us, and we're all thinking about gift ideas.

That is why I had to write you today, to let you know that
now at MillionsofAmericans.com there is an important new
addition to the site.

I am pleased to announce the opening of The Activist
Library, a place where I have put a few of my favorite
selections.

Listed you will find a diverse selection; everything from
Tom Clancy's "Debt of Honor", to William Manchester's
"Alone", a biography of Winston Churchill during the darkest
period of his life.

If your favorite book is not listed, please email me.

My hope is that this Library will be a place where
conservatives can come together, share ideas, browse, and
maybe even get a little bit of an education from some of the
greatest minds available on what it truly means to be a
conservative.

Thanks again for all of your support, and if I do not talk
to all of you again before, have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

God bless you all, and keep in touch.

For America,

Bruce Eberle
