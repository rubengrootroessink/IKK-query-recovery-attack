the family is great!  and yours?  i'm doing well, i'm actually back in
houston and really enjoying it!  i was going through some boxes at my
parents during all the moves, and found some things from austin or maybe
even from high school that were yours.  i figured you probably had no need
for any of them, much less even given any of them any thought, but before i
tossed them, just though i would check.... and no, Lucky was not in the
stack of things to get rid of!  how are things in your life?  i'm sure you
could care less about the books and binders and stuff, but i just wanted to
make sure.  i also just wanted to see how you were doing.

take care.
danielle
