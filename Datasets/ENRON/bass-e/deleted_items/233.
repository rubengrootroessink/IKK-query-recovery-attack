Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3655&key=1116&"><B>James Stewart</B></A>, RB DET - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>

Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season.

Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.<BR>

Davis (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game. You should have no reservations about starting him against the Chiefs. <BR>

Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth starting at this point. <BR>

Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. "I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals," Wilkins said. "It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks." <BR>
