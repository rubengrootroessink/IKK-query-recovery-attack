ARTICLE:
Will the U.S. regulate CO2 from power plants, giving a massive lift to the
fledgling market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions?

The U.S. Congress continues to discuss regulation of CO2 from power plants
as part of a comprehensive package to address power plant air pollution.
Hearings were convened late last year by the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee to discuss the merits of a four-pollutant power plant
strategy-controlling SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 emissions in a coordinated
fashion.
