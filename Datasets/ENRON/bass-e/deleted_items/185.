Eric,

Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  

Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  

My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  

Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.  


Brian
