PROS Announces Next Generation Trading Optimization System

 
 
January 24, 2002 -Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced the next generation of its PROS Trading Optimization System.  
 
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process and enables an automatic EDI nomination process reducing manual errors.
The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use at a major energy marketing and trading company.  Version 2.0 of the PROS Trading Optimization System is completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple and unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.  These parameters can further be configured by the user as pipelines impose various restrictions.
Matt Johnson, Senior Vice President of PROS Energy says, "PROS Trading Optimization System enables marketers to manage their physical positions and transportation assets optimally in real-time.  Companies can identify and optimally exploit market opportunities in seconds and then immediately understand the physical and economic impact of their trading on their physical position.  Today, with increasing pressure on gas margins and the convergence of the gas and power markets, PROS Trading Optimization System provides our clients a significant competitive advantage."
