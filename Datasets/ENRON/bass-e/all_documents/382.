??TravelTips

Traveling Ice
?

Take a 20 oz. soda bottle (plastic one) and fill it 3/4 the way  with water. 
Freeze it and use to keep perishable food cold. Put  in a zip lock bag to 
keep from dripping. When the bottle unthaws,  use as drinking water. Throw 
away (or recycle) soda bottle when  empty. -Joyce W.

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!
