lNO MISTAKING WHO IS IN CHARGE OF  REDSKINS...

[IMAGE]According to the Associated Press, out  of sheer habit, Terry Robisk=
ie=20
almost forgot he was  in charge during his first practice as interim coach =
of=20
the  Washington Redskins.=20

In fact, the man really in charge wasn't  there at all.=20

Dan Snyder was  attending league meetings in New York and wasn't sitting in=
=20
his  usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday. If he had been there,  th=
e=20
owner would have seen Robiskie do a double-take to keep from  following the=
=20
same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers  under fired coach=
=20
Norv Turner.=20

"Today the whistle blew and I started  going out with my receivers," Robisk=
ie=20
said. "And I realized I  couldn't. I had to go out and stand in the middle =
of=20
the field and  do whatever it is Norv's been out there doing."=20

And what did Robiskie do in the middle of  the field?=20

"I did what I usually do," Robiskie said  with a shrug. "Talking."=20

Robiskie made some changes. He eliminated  the morning walk-through so=20
players can rest their legs. He  simplified the offensive scheme. He spent=
=20
more time on special  teams, in part because new special teams coach Pat =
=20
Flaherty is also trying to nail down a new routine.=20

Robiskie also said he'll have the last  word "once the whistle blows" and t=
he=20
game begins. Otherwise, he  made it clear that Snyder is the boss.=20

"A lot of people want to separate us from  Mr. Snyder," Robiskie said. "Mr.=
=20
Snyder owns the football team. I  know that. I promise you there's very few=
=20
things in the building I'm  going to say I want to change without calling h=
im=20
to say I want to  change it."=20

The subject arose when earlier in the day  when disgruntled quarterback Bra=
d=20
Johnson said  Snyder =01* not Robiskie =01* made the decision to start Jeff=
  George=20
the rest of the season.=20

"I think that decision's made from up  top. ... I think it's obvious,"=20
Johnson said. "I think Jeff's going  to be the starter the rest of the way=
=20
out. In case something happens  with him, then I'll be ready to go.=20
Otherwise, I'm just going to  finish strong up here and deal with my=20
situation in the offseason." =20

Robiskie said the decision to go with  George was a collective one made by=
=20
the coaches and Snyder. Turner  had planned to go with George for this week=
's=20
game against Dallas.  Turner was fired Monday, a day after a 9-7 loss to th=
e=20
New York  Giants.=20

"If I wanted to change my desk, I'm going  to call him and say I want to=20
change my desk," Robiskie said. "If I  want to change quarterbacks, I'm goi=
ng=20
to call him and say, `What do  you think of me changing quarterbacks?' It's=
=20
his football team. To  try to separate it, we're wasting our time."=20

Snyder was not available for comment. His  spokesman, Karl Swanson, said=20
Robiskie "makes all  football decisions, just as Norv did. He doesn't need =
to=20
ask  anybody's permission."=20

Still, Robiskie's remarks might make it  even harder for the Redskins to lu=
re=20
a high-profile coach for next  season. One thing is for sure: The quarterba=
ck=20
who led them to their  only playoff appearance since 1993 does not plan to=
=20
return.=20

Johnson's relationship with Snyder has  been frosty since the owner signed=
=20
George to a huge contract in the  spring and refused to negotiate a new one=
=20
for Johnson. While Turner  preferred Johnson, George was Snyder's chosen=20
catch.=20

Johnson's contract expires at the end of  the season, and he restated his=
=20
intention to become a free agent. =20

"I still stand by what I want to do,"  Johnson said. "We tried to work out=
=20
stuff a long time ago, and it  didn't work out on both sides. And you've go=
t=20
to move on."=20

The only way the Redskins can keep  Johnson from becoming a free agent woul=
d=20
be to designate him as a  franchise player, but that would require an upfro=
nt=20
commitment of  about $6.5 million from a team with almost no salary cap=20
room. =20

Johnson's career record as a starter is  31-18. George's is 46-74. Johnson=
=20
said he would not mind working  with Turner again.=20

"I wouldn't have a problem strapping it  up with him again at all under=20
different circumstances," Johnson  said. "Norv's a tremendous coach. He's=
=20
going to go one way, and I'm  going to go another way, and you never know=
=20
where that road leads in  the end."

lSAINTS PK BRIEN ON THIN  ICE...

[IMAGE]According to Ted Lewis of the  New Orleans Times-Picayune, "this=20
should be a  happy time for Saints kicker Doug Brien. =20

"For the first time since he was a  rookie with the eventual Super Bowl=20
champion 49ers in 1994,  he's on a team that is zeroing in on a playoff=20
berth.=20

"But as so often happens to those  playing the most precarious position on=
=20
the team -- there's a  little dark cloud on the horizon.=20

"Unhappy with Brien's misses of  field-goal attempts in three of his last=
=20
four games, the  Saints brought in free-agent kickers Michael  Husted and=
=20
Doug Pelfrey for workouts  Tuesday, although neither was signed.=20

"'First of all, we wanted to see  who's out there,' special teams coach Al =
=20
Everest said. 'And I would hope it makes Doug aware  that he has a=20
responsibility to the team and to himself, and  that security in this=20
business is success.'=20

"It's the first time in Brien's six  seasons with the Saints that his job=
=20
appeared anything less  than secure. But the working out of Husted and=20
Pelfrey doesn't  have him looking over his shoulder any more than he has in=
=20
the  past.=20

"'I was plenty motivated before,'  said Brien, who was told about the=20
workouts by Everest on  Monday. 'So it doesn't increase my motivation.=20

"'And it doesn't affect my  concentration, either. There's always a long li=
ne=20
of guys out  there, whether they're here working out or in camp. If you =20
don't perform to a certain standard, that's what happens.' =20

"By Brien standards, he is not  having a good year. The fifth most-accurate=
=20
kicker in league  history coming into the season (80.3 percent) is 17-of-23=
, =20
.739. The six misses are Brien's most since 1995 when he was  7-of-12 in si=
x=20
games with the 49ers and 12-of-17 in eight  games with the Saints. Since th=
en=20
the most he has missed has  been five.=20

"Brien, the number-two kicker from  beyond 50 yards in league history befor=
e=20
this season (.700),  has been allowed to try only two from that distance, a=
nd=20
both  were blocked.=20

"'I've been struggling a little  bit,' said Brien, who took extra kicks in=
=20
practice Wednesday.  'I haven't been hitting the ball as well as I normally=
=20
do. =20

"'It's very frustrating, but at the  same time, the law of averages plays i=
n.=20
I've been pretty  consistent over the last five years here, and I wouldn't=
=20
say  I'm doing horribly. I just expect to do better, and the Saints  expect=
=20
me to be better.'=20

"It's not so much how many kicks  Brien has missed but when he has missed=
=20
them.=20

"At St. Louis, he was wide right on  a 44-yarder with 2:21 left that would=
=20
have given the Saints a  10-point lead. Instead, they had to sweat out two=
=20
more  possessions by the Rams that could have tied the score. =20

"And last week against Denver, he  was wide left on a 43-yarder in the firs=
t=20
quarter that would  have given the Saints the early lead. Never mind that h=
e=20
made  three more after that.=20

"That miss had Saints coach  Jim Haslett visibly unhappy on the sideline =
=20
last Sunday and again on Monday=20

"'It wasn't the hold,' Haslett said  then. 'It wasn't the snap. It wasn't=
=20
protection.=20

"'He just missed it, and it would  have been nice to have had those three=
=20
points.'=20

"But Wednesday, Haslett took the  unusual step of sitting with Brien at his=
=20
locker for several  minutes after practice, engaging in what appeared to be=
 =20
lighthearted encouragement.=20

"'I have confidence in Doug,'  Haslett said. 'I can't get inside kickers'=
=20
heads, but Doug  will fight through this, and everything will be fine.=20

"'Everybody goes through this in a  point in their career.'=20

"Maybe so, but kickers and punters  are the only front-line players who can=
=20
be replaced on a  moment's notice, even this late in the season.=20

"'Right now, kicking field goals  and extra points is all Doug does since o=
ur=20
kickoff guy is  Toby (Gowin),' Everest said. 'But we haven't seen anybody=
=20
yet  we think is better than Doug.'=20

"To be sure, the Saints will bring  in two more kickers next Tuesday, Jeff=
=20
Hall  and Scott Blanton.=20

"And to Brien, who likes to think  of each kick being of equal value, no=20
matter the distance or  the situation, it is a time to strive to do better.=
=20

"'I've been pressing a little too  much and trying to make things happen,' =
he=20
said. 'I'm not way  far off, but it doesn't take too much.=20

"'I don't think I've ever missed a  kick at the end of a game that's cost t=
he=20
team a game, and I  don't intend to start now. I'm doing what I can to get=
=20
this  fixed and just keep plugging along.'"=20

Also of interest...=20

ESPN's John  Clayton reported that Terry Allen  will probably get the start=
=20
at halfback for the Saints because  of the neck injury to Jerald Moore and=
=20
the  sore shoulder of Chad Morton. Morton may play  on his shoulder, but=20
Moore, who has had three recent neck  stingers, probably won't.=20

However, neither man was included  on Friday's list of early inactives (Ric=
ky=20
 Williams and Jake Reed were the only  offensive skill players on that list=
).=20

As stated in USA  Today, WR Joe Horn had 10 catches  for 180 yards against=
=20
the Niners the last time the two teams  met, the third-best receiving yards=
=20
game in club history. He  needs nine receptions to break the Saints=20
single-season record  for catches in one year. Eric Martin holds  the team=
=20
record of 85. Last week, Horn became only the fifth  receiver in club histo=
ry=20
to gain 1,000 receiving yards. Martin  did it three times.=20

According to Pro Football  Weekly, the first person among a throng of =20
well-wishers to meet Saints QB Aaron Brooks  when he got off the plane=20
following the Saints=01, huge Week 13  win in St. Louis was an absolutely=

[IMAGE]Tim Tyers of the  Arizona Republic reported this  morning that=20
Cardinals quarterback Jake  Plummer's injured ribs didn't allow him  to=20
practice on Friday and whether he plays on  Sunday at Jacksonville will be=
=20
determined by a  dreaded game-day decision, according to head coach  Dave=
=20
McGinnis.=20

"He hasn't been able to  practice for two days, and that's not a good  sign=
,"=20
McGinnis said. "If he's not ready to go,  there's no reason to play him. I'=

not going to  risk him. It makes no sense."=20

If Plummer can't go,  number-two quarterback Dave  Brown, who is still=20
experiencing soreness  in the left shoulder he injured in his only start  t=
wo=20
weeks ago against the New York Giants, will  start. But McGinnis also=20
guaranteed that if Brown  does start, number-three man Chris  Greisen will=

"It's the first I've  heard of it," Greisen. "I have to be ready, either =

Also of interest... =20

McGinnis said he will  take three running backs with the team to =20
Jacksonville. Michael Pittman  (hyperextended big toe) saw limited duty on=

"Thomas has been fine  the last two days. He seems to be getting a lot =20

Other items of interest...=20

Quarterback Jeff  Garcia, who is ranked third in the latest results of  fan=

balloting for the Pro Bowl, would welcome a ticket to  Honolulu for the=20
February 4 game.=20

"If I'm able to be selected to  represent this team in the Pro Bowl, I'd=20
definitely be honored  and I think it just shows people I've turned a long=

way," said  Garcia, who threw for 323 yards and two touchdowns Sunday. =20

49ers offensive coordinator  Marty Mornhinweg endorsed Garcia's Pro Bowl =

candidacy. "Jeff threw the football in that game Sunday  against San Diego =

And finally... Placekicker  Wade Richey isn't afraid to talk about the  hot=

streak he's been on in the past two games. He just isn't  sure how to expla=

the way he's made all six of his  field-goal attempts, which have ranged=20

"They've been short kicks, but  they've felt good," said Richey who had=20
