media in effort to bolster their team's image:=20
=09

games five times in the 1990s.=20

Applewhite's right knee appears to be responding pretty well. He practiced=
=20
Tuesday for the first time since getting injured at Texas Tech. Mack Brown=
=20
said if Applewhite is healthy enough to back up Simms, he would use=20
Applewhite on a need-to-win-the-game basis. Those situations would seem to=
=20
include Simms getting hurt or Simms being completely ineffective. Otherwise=

I think he'll have a good chance of playing early because Kenny Hayter, Iva=

Williams and Victor Ike did not overwhelm the coaches this season. But Snee=

=09
=09 Q: I sent you a question last week about the intensity and "hate" that =
the=20
Horns didn't have for the OU game and was wondering if Coach Brown: a) thin=
ks=20
he made a mistake by having the players take the OU game so lightly with=20
comments like "...we don't hate OU..." and "... it's just another game on t=
he=20
schedule..." and, b) is that the attitude that will prevail going into the=
=20
A=02?game, and in future OU games?=20
=09?? Joe Rushing=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown and his staff are not an in-your-face group of coach=
es.=20
Players say that they are treated with respect. Make no mistake, they know=
=20
their jobs are on the line every day in practice. They know if they don't=
=20
perform in practice, they will be replaced. But SS Greg Brown said that Mac=
k=20
Brown has never given a "hell hath no fury" locker room talk, before, durin=
g=20
or after a game. Greg Brown said that Mack simply states what's on the line=
=20
for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate=20
themselves. Mack has said that as well. He said he asks players what works=
=20
for them best: whether it be the tough-love approach or the straightforward=
=20
approach. He has said constant yelling wears off. So he doesn't play head=
=20
games with his team. According to coaches and players from his time as OU=
=20
offensive coordinator back in 1984, Mack used to be a much more in-your-fac=
e=20
kind of coach, yelling at players to get them going. Coach Barry Switzer ha=
d=20
to tone him down. Brown said he has learned that you can't be negative with=
=20
players, that you have to treat them with respect. I don't know that you wi=
ll=20
hear him talk about hating other teams.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Looking at the haul of recruits Texas already has commitments from, =
is=20
there an area of need not being addressed? It appears that this is quite a=
=20
haul of offensive linemen, so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the makin=
g.=20
If he signs, what will Quan Cosby be asked to do? Doesn't he have a twin=20
brother - and is that a factor on where he signs? When all is said and done=
,=20
where do you think this class will rank come signing day in February and=20
which of the potential signees, not orally committed, will most determine=
=20
where that rank ends up? Also, with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt ye=
ar=20
and from what I am reading, an impressive one at that, what do you see in t=
he=20
future for Cedric Benson? What about the returning RBs such as Ivan William=
s,=20
Kenny Hayter, et al? Is the abundance of talent at RB a good thing or too=
=20
much of a good thing? And one last thing: Is anyone looking to transfer aft=
er=20
the season?=20
=09?? Roy Cassas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Quarterbacks and linemen (on both sides of the ball) control th=
e=20
game, so you can never have enough of those positions. UT is filling its=20
needs nicely with the commitments that it has. The player that can probably=
=20
make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, perhaps th=
e=20
best defensive tackle in the country. UT's class is shaping up as a top 10=
=20
nationally, again. If Harris comes, it will climb. But as is the case with=
=20
all of this recruiting hype, it's just that - hype. Who knows if Cedric=20
Benson will play next year? He has to come down here in the heat of August=
=20
and prove to the coaches that he's better than Kenny Hayter, Ivan Williams,=
=20
Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran. I would say Benson's chances are good if som=
e=20
of those guys don't toughen up and let loose. But time will tell. As far as=
=20
guys looking to transfer, there aren't any rumblings yet. Stay tuned.=20

=09UT's road uniforms =20
=09
=09Q: I can say this because I am a graduate of the University of Texas: I =
think=20
the Longhorn football team has the UGLIEST uniform in all of college=20
football. When the Horns play on the road, they have too much white and not=
=20
enough color. They wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long sol=
id=20
white socks are atrocious. It looks like each player can dress anyway he=20
desires, there is no uniformity in the look. Some players don't even wear=
=20
socks at all. It seems =20
=09
=09the coaches let each player express their own individuality, and I think=
 they=20
play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team. Coach McWilliams let=
=20
this trend start and it has continued through the current regime with poor=
=20
results. The orange home jerseys are not the right color orange, and they=
=20
look cheap. I wish Coach Brown would adopt a true burnt orange color. I wis=
h=20
he would change the helmets to the same burnt orange color with a white=20
traditional Longhorn logo on each side and a white facemask. Shirttails=20
should be tucked in and each player should be dressed the same. Few=20
indicators of individuality should be allowed. The Longhorns look ragtag an=
d=20
slow on the field. If they would improve their image, their play might=20
improve as well. =20
=09 ?? John Robert Pharr, Waco, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  That seemed to be more of a comment than a question. But everyo=
ne is=20
entitled to their own opinion. I don't know about the burnt orange helmets.=
=20
That might be a little too much of a good thing.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the loss to OU will hurt our recruiting class? I k=
now=20
that we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their recrui=
ts=20
at the Cotton Bowl (since they were the home team). =20
=09?? T. Franks, Austin =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It appears that Oklahoma is making some serious inroads on UT=
=20
recruiting territory, at least for the 10 or so recruits the Longhorns stil=
l=20
hope to get orally committed. Namely, Tommie Harris, the defensive tackle o=
ut=20
of Killeen Ellison. Texas needs to take care of business on Friday to keep=
=20
the Sooners from stepping up their pitch for some of the noncommitted kids =
UT=20
is hoping to sign.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: The lack of respect Texas is getting leading up to the A=02?game is=
=20
disturbing. I understand that the Horns were crushed against OU and also ha=
d=20
an early-season loss against Stanford on the road, but even with the stats=
=20
from those two losses, the Horns have one of the nation's top 5 defensive=
=20
units, plus we are playing at home and are riding the confidence of five=20
consecutive wins.=20
=09 ?? Derrick Jackson, Coppell, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, Texas is a 5-1/2 point favorite, so I don't know where th=
e=20
lack of respect comes from. But I think people are lukewarm about UT becaus=
e=20
the Longhorns haven't had a chance to show how much they've improved agains=

=09Quentin Jammer =20
=09
=09Q: What are the key matchups in Friday's game?=20
=09?? Lucas Harrington=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  In think the best matchups will be MLB De'Andre Lewis against A=
&M's=20
corps of running backs, namely Ja'Mar Toombs. Also keep an eye on Quentin=
=20
Jammer against A=02?WR Robert Ferguson. Lewis basically said this week that=
 if=20
you hit Toombs in the mouth, he'll fold. So that immediately inspires some=
=20
interest in that matchup. Jammer also had a lot to say about Ferguson,=20
stating that if =20
=09
=09Ferguson's ankle wasn't 100 percent, it might not even be a close matchu=
p.=20
"If he's 50 percent or 75 percent, that won't cut it," Jammer said. Jammer=
=20
did say that he thought a healthy Ferguson was better than Kansas State WR=
=20
Quincy Morgan. Jammer and Ferguson are both big, roughly 6-1 and 205 pounds=
.=20
Should be fun to watch.=20

ing to=20
air out the ball and not being able to?=20
=09?? Stephen Torrence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think so. It seems hard to believe. After Branndon Stewart an=
d all=20
the hype about building a big-time passing offense the past several years,=
=20
it's finally hit College Station. The Aggies run four-wide, even five-wide.=
=20
They have trick plays, and Robert Ferguson, Bethel Johnson and Chris Taylor=
=20
are big-time receivers. And 25-year-old QB Mark Farris is the gritty leader=
=20
and 60 percent passer they have been looking for. I think it will be a dece=
nt=20
test for Texas, owner of the nation's No. 1-ranked pass efficiency defense.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: Why does Texas keep throwing that out pattern and allowing Chris Sim=
ms to=20
be intercepted for touchdowns?=20
=09?? Margie Phillips=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I'll let Mack Brown answer that one: "It's not the same pass or=
 we=20
would throw it out of the playbook. We're not that dumb." That was his=20
comment Tuesday night on his radio show.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms is ready for the pressure of the Texas A=02=
?game?=20
=09?? Deginald Franks=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think so. Simms seemed to grow in confidence after the Kansas=
=20
game. Getting the chance to pull the Longhorns out of a 14-0 hole after=20
throwing a pick for a TD really seemed to give him a positive jolt. Normall=
y,=20
he would have been pulled at that point for Major Applewhite - at least he=
=20
would have been pulled early in the season (a la Louisiana-Lafayette). So=
=20
getting the chance to play an entire game seemed to help. I believe Simms=
=20
will be fine on Friday. He must feel good about his deep ball to Roy Willia=
ms=20
after the success they had at Kansas. I would expect to see a lot more of=
=20
that, creating room for Hodges Mitchell to run against a depleted A=02?fron=
t=20
seven. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I heard that this is only the ninth time that Texas and Texas A=02?a=
re both=20
ranked coming into this game. That doesn't seem right.=20
=09?? Brock Marshal=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It doesn't seem right, but it is. Of the 107 times these two te=
ams=20
have met (including this year), both have been ranked only nine times. Thos=
e=20
years are 2000, 1999, 1995, 1985, 1977, 1975, 1974, 1943 and 1941.=20
