Hi Folks,

?

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.?=20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm=
? =20
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.??=20

Note:? I=01,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last f=
our=20
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mik=
e=20
Hall=01,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/fo=
r=20
more info.? =20

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

Seattle Passing  Game vs Bronco Defense??  If we=01,ve seen one  trend rece=
ntly=20
in defenses it=01,s to start your QB / WR / TEs against the Broncos  and wo=
rry=20
about your RBs.? They=01,re  tough on the running game but easy against the=
=20
pass.? I won=01,t get into whether that=01,s a  =01&chicken or the egg=018 =
situation but=20
the bottom line is go with your passing guys  against Denver.? They rank # =
31=20
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? QB Jon Kitna =
=20
gets another start  and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in=
=20
him, he=01,s been ok.? Derrick  Mayesand  Sean  Dawkinsshould see lots  of=
=20
action and rookie Darrell  Jacksonis working his  way back into the mix.? I=
f=20
you=01,ve  been sitting on RB Shaun  Alexander, coach Mike  Holmgren did sa=
y he=20
wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but I=01,m  still not too=
=20
excited about him yet.

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Bengal Defense?? Once again, keep an eye on  QB=
=20
Steve  McNair=01,shealth this  week.? It=01,s early, but he=01,s already  b=
eing called=20
a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle  injuries.?=
=20
Keep your fingers crossed  as it=01,s a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa=
ss=20
defense.? They rank # 30 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last=
=20
month and are just playing out the season.? Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost=
=20
for the  year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier.?=
=20
Derrick  Masonis the clear cut  # 1 WR with Chris  Sanders# 2.? The best=20
receiver on the team (or at  least most utilized) is TE Frank  Wycheckwho=
=01,s=20
starting to  get back to his normal high level of  production.

Denver Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense??? By now you know the  drill:? Sta=
rt=20
any player vs  Seattle.? Just do it.? The Seahawks are anemic.? QB Brian=20
Griese did start to throw some  but he=01,s still at least a couple weeks a=
way,=20
maybe more.? Gus  Frerottegets another  start and if you=01,re looking for =
him=20
to regain that 400+ yard form he showed  early on, this is his best chance =
to=20
do it.? Rod Smithand  Ed  McCaffreyare the usual  must starts at WR.?  Dway=
ne=20
 Carswelland  Desmond  Clarkare excellent  plays at TE.? I=01,d start eithe=
r=20
one  and feel pretty good about it, especially  Carswell.

Baltimore Passing  Game vs Charger Defense?? San Diego made a run back at =
=20
respectability on defense but I=01,m thinking they=01,ve fallen back down t=
o well =20
below average.? Over the last four  weeks, they rank # 27 in passing yards=
=20
allowed per game.? For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed =
to=20
the opposing QB.?  The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be=
=20
ready to  roll.? QB Trent  Dilferis playing  exceptionally well and WRs=20
Qadry  Ismailand  Patrick  Johnsoncould do  well.? The most enticing matchu=
p=20
may  be Shannon  Sharpeas San Diego  ranks just 24th in Fantasy Points=20
allowed to the opposing TE for the  year.

St. Louis Passing  Game vs Viking Defense?? I don=01,t think you keep  QB K=
urt =20
Warnerdown for  long.? Sure, he had an awful game  last week but some of th=
at=20
can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you don=01,t see drop  half of what Warn=
er=20
throws this time.?  The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking=
 #=20
26 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last month.? For the year,=
=20
they rank # 24 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  Isaac Bruce=
=20
is the best WR  while Torry Holthas been  surprisingly disappointing lately=
.?=20
 He=01,s still worth a start though.?  Az-Zahir  Hakimalways has a  chance =
too.?=20
The Vikings just don=01,t  have the secondary to keep up with these  guys.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Colt Defense?? I probably get more mail from my =
=20
ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player.? I make no apologies as=
 I=20
really just  don=01,t like the guy.? He simply has  major troubles finishin=
g a=20
game.?  Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy, one of th=
e =20
weaker defenses in the league.?  Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is=
=20
questionable so they might be  even less effective.? On the other  hand, th=
e=20
Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home.? As you can see from my=
=20
rankings, I=01,m not  thinking too much of Johnson again this week, but he =
does=20
have a good  matchup.? Eric Moulds is the  primary WR as always with Peerle=
ss=20
Price and Jeremy McDonald  picking up the scraps.? TE Jay  Reimersma is a=
=20
favorite target and gets plenty of looks.?

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Giants Defense?? The Kordell Stewart  Bandwagon=
=20
is getting awfully crowded lately, but for good reason.? He=01,s playing ve=
ry=20
solid football.? More importantly, he cleared a huge  hurdle Sunday showing=
=20
some leadership and toughness coming back in the game  after injuring his=
=20
leg.? The Giants  defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim=20
Fassell=01,s media games where  he says =01&ok=018 more than Joe Pesci in L=
ethal=20
Weapon are apparently working as his  playoff guarantee seems to have=20
inspired the team.?? The pass defense still ranks # 25  in passing yards=20
allowed  per game over the last month though.? For the year, they rank # 23=
 =20
in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing QB.? Hines Ward is the WR of=20
choice on  this team and I=01,d feel fine starting him. He=01,s not even th=
e true #=20
2 guy, but  you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw.? For some=
=20
reason, I like him over starter  Courtney Hawkins. Even TE Mark Bruener is =
a=20
solid choice as he=01,s  done more in the last two weeks than he=01,s done =
in two=20
years.???

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Panthers Defense? I=01,m  dreading the Gunther=
=20
Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like  Iron Mike.? A soli=
d=20
game here could  help him keep his job (which may have Chief fans pulling f=
or=20
Carolina=01()? From a FF perspective, I like Elvis  Grbac here.? He showed=
=20
Monday  night he was clearly back from the finger troubles.? As usual, the=
=20
running game is a mess but  that=01,s good news for Elvis owners as he=01,s=
 forced=20
to go with what=01,s been working  for them =01) throwing the ball.? TE  To=
ny=20
Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and  he=
=01,s=20
certainly the best receiver on the team.? Derrick Alexander is a sure =20
starter too.? Sylvester  Morris continues to regress which is troubling.?=
=20
Carolina ranks just # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last=
=20
four games although for the year, they=01,ve  fared better ranking # 9 in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.? Part  of that is they seem to=
=20
give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be  leery in TD only=20
leagues.?

Carolina  Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? If you=01,ve been fence sitting w=
ith =20
Steve Beuerlein, this may be a week to take a close look at him.? The Chief=
s=20
rank # 21 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and=
=20
they may be missing CB James  Hasty who=01,s questionable with a knee.?  WR=
=20
Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and he=01,s  a sure=
=20
starter.? Donald Hayes  got through last week=01,s game without reinjuring =
his=20
groin and he=01,s a solid  option as well.? TE Kris  Mangum is no Wesley Wa=
lls=20
but he=01,s a pretty good player.? The Chiefs do get back home where  they=
=01,re=20
tougher but I like this matchup.?

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  The 49er pass defense is=
=20
better than people think and the Saints defense  is worse than many assume.=
?=20
Over the  last four games New Orleans ranks # 20 in passing yards allowed=
=20
per  game.? (the 49ers  rank # 16)? In reality, both  defenses are pretty=
=20
suspect.? And  both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball.? Jeff=
=20
Garcia picked up right where  he left off last week against a tough San Die=
go=20
defense.? It was great news for Terrell  Owens fans as he looks on his way=
=20
back.? In the meantime, Jerry Rice  showed he still has a few tricks in the=
=20
bag.? I wouldn=01,t be surprised to see Tai  Streets and J.J. Stokes see=20
increased time at Rice=01,s expense though  as many feel the Hall of Famer =
isn=01,t=20
in the 49er=01,s plans for 2001.? RB Charlie Garner is always a threat  cat=
ching=20
the ball.? TE Greg  Clark is suddenly a producer so he=01,s worth a shot to=
o.=20
This could be a  shootout.?

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Two teams heading for the=
=20
couch in the post season but that=01,s about all  they have in common.?=20
Jacksonville  just ran out of time as they=01,re playing well now.? Arizona=
 is=20
heading downhill from an  already low position.? Arizona ranks  # 19 over t=
he=20
last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game.? QB Mark  Brunell had a=
n=20
injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be  fine.? He could be a=
=20
decent play  along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.? Arizona CB=
=20
Aneaes Williams is a player  but he can=01,t do it all.? The biggest  probl=
em=20
for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling =20
something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a 7 yard=20
gain  each time=01(?

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Ram Defense?? You don=01,t need any analysis fro=
m  me=20
to know you=01,d better start Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter and Randy  Moss=
.?=20
The Rams are much  improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks,=
=20
they rank # 17  in passing yards allowed  per game.? Still  though, the=20
Minnesota =01&Big 3=018 (=01&Big 4=018 counting RB Robert Smith) are no  br=
ainers.?? =20

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense?? QB Aaron Brooks  continues to b=
e=20
one of the better stories of this season.? He=01,s facing a 49er time that=
=01,ll be=20
chock  full of youngsters although they=01,re playing better of late rankin=
g #=20
16  in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.? But that=
=20
was before losing Safety Lance  Shulters to a torn ACL last week.?  Brooks=
=20
will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should  continue to shine.?=
=20
Willie  Jackson is a solid # 2 WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive =20
lately.? =20

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Detroit  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Of course, all this hinges on the=
 =20
ribs of one Charlie Batch.?  If he can=01,t go, all bets are off.?  In fact=
,=20
even if he can go, you should hedge your bets a bit as we=01,ve  already se=
en=20
one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch.? It=01,s not a=
 bad=20
matchup though against a  Green Bay defense that=01,s ranked # 22 in passin=
g=20
yards allowed per  game.? Johnnie  Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi=
th=20
Herman Moore in the mix  too.? Germane Crowell may be  able to make his=20
return this week as he=01,s been practicing this week.? I wouldn=01,t start=
 him yet=20
but keep an eye  out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him=
=20
up.? I can see plenty of James Stewart in  this one though as the weather=
=20
could be really nasty for this  one.?

Chicago  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? This one=01,s full of story line=
s as =20
a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane =20
Matthews.? The juicy rumor here  is that according to a story in the Sun=20
Times, McNown would receive a $8.25  million escalator clause if he plays i=
n=20
55% of the offensive snaps this year and  next.? He=01,s currently at 54%=
=01(?=20
Conspiracies aside, Matthews will be  without WR Marcus Robinson who=01,s o=
ut=20
for the year with a bulging disk in  his back.? New England ranks # 23  ove=
r=20
the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game but the turmoil coul=
d=20
take it=01,s toll on the Bears.? The Bears will also be without Offensive =
=20
Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job.? Some think that will be a=
=20
positive.?? I honestly have a hard time  getting too excited about Eddie=20
Kennison and Marty  Booker.?

Dallas  Passing Game vs Redskin Defense? I=01,m really interested to see ho=
w=20
the  team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie.?  I=01,ll be surprised if t=
hey=20
don=01,t kick things up several notches.? Although I do find it odd that th=
e=20
guy  in charge of the worst performing part of the team (passing game) is t=
he=20
guy  they decided to elevate to head coach.?  Who knows?? QB Troy  Aikman=
=20
will try to get through another game without being maimed.? He=01,ll have J=
ames=20
McKnight and  Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promisin=
g=20
against a  pretty tough defense.? Dallas showed  last week the complete lac=
k=20
of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding  Emmitt Smith the ball =
as=20
they trailed Tampa by a mile.? David LaFluer and Jackie  Harris both are=20
dropping along with Aikman.?

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Brown Defense?? Two teams used to bringing up=
=20
the  rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping.? QB Donovan=
=20
McNabb finds himself  in a strange spot here.? The Browns  are so pitiful=
=20
against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them  at the=20
expense of throwing it.? But  with McNabb the team=01,s best rusher, he=01,=
ll have=20
to decide which way he=01,s going to  beat the Browns.? Charles Johnson  an=
d=20
Torrance Small aren=01,t much.?  TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he =
could=20
make some  noise.? I'm interested to see how quickly they work in newly=20
signed  RB Chris Warren.

Miami  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense??  Another good case of=20
misconceptions.? Miami is better throwing the ball than  people give them=
=20
credit for and the Bucs aren=01,t as dominant stopping the pass  like many=
=20
think.? Over the last four  weeks, Tampa ranks # 14 in passing yards allowe=
d=20
per  game.? Very solid  for sure, but not dominating.?  Jay Fiedler continu=
es=20
to astound his critics as he threw for 3 TDs  Sunday.? I don=01,t think you=
=01,ll=20
see  the same production here but he=01,s still a decent play.? Leslie Shep=
herd=20
had been my  favorite WR here but with his surgery, it looks like Tony Mart=
in=20
will  finally get a start.? Oronde  Gadsden continues to make sick catches.=
?

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense ??This is where Doug Pederson=01,s=
 at:?=20
He gets the start this week because  rookie Spergon Wynn can=01,t go due to=
=20

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Titan Defense?? The Bengals just won=01,t die =
=20
quietly.? Corey Dillon keeps running  the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott=
 =20

?=20
He may be able to but he draws a tough  matchup Sunday in a Titan team that=
=01,s=20
solid.? They rank # 11 over the last four week  in passing yards allowed pe=

game.?  Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad=
=20
wrist  and will likely have to play with a brace.?  WR  Peter Warrickwill=

big play  potential.

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Steeler Defense?? The Steelers seemed to=20
enjoy the  spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot=
=20
this week  against the Giants.? Pittsburgh=01,s  playing tough pass defense=

Oakland Passing  Game vs Jets Defense?? The Raiders look to bounce back  th=
is=20
week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and =20
distance.? The Jets are playing  tough defense of late ranking # 9 in passi=

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Tampa Bay Passing  Game vs Miami Defense??  Don=01,t start your  passing ga=
