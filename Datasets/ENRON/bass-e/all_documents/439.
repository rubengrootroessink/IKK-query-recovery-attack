Well, the only thing that you have to remember is that between where these
are and SMU it is only about 5 miles apart.  In the SMU area there is the
Doubletree, Marriott Courtyard, Residence Inn.

Here is a more comprehensive list that has phone numbers.  I have stayed at
most of the hotels around there and the most bang for your buck is the
Doubletree.  Not too expensive and pretty nice.

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice
and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Saturday would be good for me if you can squeeze it in.  I am going to see
Dad tonight.  I will be there at about 7.

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

I can do the tv but I am busy all weekend so, if I can do it next week let
me know.  I might be able to squeeze it in on Saturday b/c I will be out
that way.


On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in
Dallas?
