NEW YORK  --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to 
get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The 
batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference 
earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. 

"We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets 
batting coach. "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we 
received and believe we have been denied our right to hit." 

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had 
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.  It was 
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls,  though a 
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. 

Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively 
reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in 
fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. 

"The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of  our 
right to hit," said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet 
and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely." 

Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games 
and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. 
"While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, 
there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the 
commissioner said. 

Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base 
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the 
final scores of the games. "It's clear that we were slightly on-base more 
often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman. "The World Series crown is 
rightly ours." 

The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some 
light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes "we need to let 
the process run its course without a rush to judgment."
