Dear Santa Claus:

We were good boys and girls last year, so please don't bring us a lump of 
coal again.  If you feel the need to bring us something black, the Saint 
Arnold Winter Stout will be available before Christmas.  If you take them out 
of the six pack, they will fit into our stockings, but please let us know so 
we can reinforce the hooks our stockings hang on.  Here are some other things 
on our Christmas list.  Some are events that we would like all of our friends 
to attend.

What I want for Christmas:

1. A case of Christmas Ale, but please buy it quickly because the distributor 
only has a week of inventory left right now.  That won't last until 
Christmas.  I understand that there may be a deal on it at a large warehouse 
store, but I'm not allowed to tell you where.  Do you remember the name of 
the protagonist of "Green Eggs and Ham"?

2. All my friends to come to our Toys for Tots Bratwurst Promotion Friday, 
December 8 at the Midtown Station, 2306 Brazos, 713-522-1041.  It is from 
6pm-9pm.  Bring an unwrapped toy.  The Marines will be there (they administer 
the program) to collect the toys for the underprivileged.  Everyone should 
make a point of doing something charitable during the holiday season.  It 
will make you enjoy it even more.

3. A new St. Arnold Wants You t-shirt.  All my friends already have one.

4. All my friends to come to the 6th Annual Celtic Christmas at the Garden in 
the Heights, Sunday, December 17 from 12:00 noon - 11:00 pm.  If you bring 
this email with you, you get a $2 discount off the door price. Regular 
prices: $12.00 at the door, $8.00 advance, children 12 and under are admitted 
free. Entertainment: Seven Nations, The Flying Fish Sailors, Godfreys 
Rangers, Celtic Rebellion Dancers, The Battle of the Oak King & the Holly 
King.

5. A new St. Arnold fishing hat.  You know, the floppy canvas type with an 
embroidered St. Arnold logo on it.  It's the height of fashion.

6. A president-elect.

7. A six-pack of Amber Ale every week of the year.  

8. A (choose one) nubile young lady or strapping young buck to rub scented 
massage oil into my shoulders.

9. A warm St. Arnold sweatshirt to wear on these cold, December nights in 
case you don't bring me number 8.

10. A Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, or Jolly Kwaanza and a Happy New Year.

Love,

Saint Arnold's Army
