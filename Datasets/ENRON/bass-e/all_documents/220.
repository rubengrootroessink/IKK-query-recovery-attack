Burntsand e-Business Xpert Xpress features Marc Karstaedt, Vice President,
e-Trading for Burntsand who will deliver his presentation "Automated Trading
Exchanges", a topic of increasing strategic interest within the
business-to-business (B2B) community.

This Xpress is designed to give the business and/or technical executive an
appreciation of the various exchange models, success factors and some
insight into Burntsand's "lessons learned" from multiple successful
implementations.

"Competition is no longer a question of big versus the small or even fast
versus slow, - in the new economy it is those that do it well who will
succeed!" Marc Karstaedt, VP, eTrading.

Upon the conclusion of the presentation, listeners are invited to ask Marc
questions or share their experiences and insights.

Access to the web-cast presentation and a dial in number will be
communicated to registrants prior to the event. If you have any questions
about this event, please feel free to email me at lplotkin@burntsand.com or
call me at 713.890.8045.  I would really appreciate if you could forward
this message to other individuals in your organization that might be
interested in this topic.

Thanks so much and have a great weekend!

Lesley
