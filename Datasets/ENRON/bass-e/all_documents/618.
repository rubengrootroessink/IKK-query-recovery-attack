 Latest NBA Player News 

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/11/00 
 The Raptors placed Bogues on the injury list today, as he will be out four 
to six weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. To 
replace him on the roster, Toronto activated center Garth Joseph, who at 7-2 
is nearly two feet taller, from the injured list.  

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 The Rockets placed Cato on the injured list today, as he will be out for up 
to six weeks with a high left ankle sprain. Houston activated rookie forward 
Dan Langhi, who has been out all season with an upper leg injury, from the 
injury list to replace Cato on the roster.  

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/10/00 
 Nowitzki sprained his left(non-shooting) shoulder Thursday after practice 
and is doubtful for Friday's game.  Look for Michael Finley or Christian 
Laettner to replace him in the starting frontcourt.    

 Lamond Murray , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Murray sat out practice Thursday with a sprained left knee but is expected 
to play against Toronto Friday.  Look for Matt Harpring to start at small 
forward if Murray is unable to play.    

 P.J. Brown , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brown sat out Thursday's game due to a strained left achilles.  He is 
expected to play in Saturday's road game against the Knicks.    

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 Mutombo scored 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his first game of the 
season Thursday.  He had missed the first five games and most of the 
preseason with a case of Malaria.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/10/00 
 Sprewell missed Wednesday's game against Cleveland and will sit out Friday's 
matchup against the Celtics.  Glen Rice will start at small forward for the 
Knicks in his absence.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  He is listed as day-to-day.  Erick Strickland will backup Charlie Ward 
at point guard if Childs is unable to play.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Majerle will try to run at practice today and is not sure whether he will be 
ready to return Saturday.  He has missed the first four games of the season 
with a hamstring injury.          

 Eric Williams , F BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Head coach Rick Pitino has moved Paul Pierce to small forward so Williams 
will now come off the bench for the Celtics.  He is averaging 4.0 points and 
2.3 rebounds per game.    

 Paul Pierce , F BOS - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 In a move to prevent Pierce and Antoine Walker from being double-teamed, 
head coach Rick Pitino has inserted Bryant Stith and Rick Brunson into the 
starting lineup.  Stith will play shooting guard and Pierce will move to 
small forward.  This move shouldn't affect Pierce when playing against teams 
in the Eastern Conference but could influence his numbers when he plays 
against the taller small forwards in the West.     

 Bryant Stith , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Stith will make his debut as the Celtics' starting shooting guard Friday 
against the Knicks.  Paul Pierce will move to small forward.  Stith is a good 
shooter and a dependable scorer but has been injury prone in his NBA 
career.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brunson will start at point guard for the Celtics Friday.  But he may give 
way to Chris Herren on Saturday when he is activated from the injury list.  
Keep an eye on Brunson.  Although he is not a prolific scorer he is a good 
passer and a solid defender.  He may be a solid Fantasy pickup within the 
next few weeks.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Williams was back in action Thursday against the Grizzlies.  He sat out 
Tuesday's game against the Lakers due to a mild knee sprain.  Williams showed 
no effects from the injury Thursday hitting 4-of-5 three-point attempts and 
scoring 13 points.    

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Harris played in his first game of the season Thursday against the Pistons.  
He had been sidelined since the beginning of training camp with a hernia.  
Harris scored five points in 12 minutes against Detroit.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Gill sat out Thursday's game against the Pistons because of a sore knee.  
Stephen Jackson moved from small forward to shooting guard and Aaron Williams 
moved into the starting lineup at forward in his absence.  Gill is expected 
to return to action in time for Saturday's home game against Seattle.    

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Wallace played against the Nets Thursday despite suffering from an injured 
left leg.  He scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 31 minutes of 
playing time.  

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Bogues will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Friday, which 
will sideline him for up to six weeks. He has been scratched from each of 
Toronto's last four games while the severity of the injury was determined.    
 

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 An arbitrator upheld commissioner David Stern's initial ruling on Thursday, 
stripping Smith of his Larry Bird rights.  Players with Bird rights can 
re-sign with their team even if the team is over the salary cap. Smith will 
have to play three more seasons to re-earn those rights.  Smith will probably 
sign with another team now.  The Timberwolves can offer Smith a one-year 
contract for no more than $611,000. Other teams, including the Miami Heat and 
Chicago Bulls, can offer Smith more than six times that amount.     

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  "Never 
Nervous" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped "The Man of Steel" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.
