A&M / UT Grads (or anyone wanting to become an honorary grad),

 Sorry for the late notice, but we (we meaning UT and A&M grads here at 
Enron) are trying to raise money for scholarships 
for the two greatest schools in Texas (well, one is slightly better than the 
other).  We are having a Flag Football challenge tomorrow
(sorry, all the teams are full).  If you would like to come to show some 
support, it should be a blast!  I have to have the money 
collected by 5:00 PM today.  Any contributions will be matched by Enron.  If 
you would like to contribute to A&M, make checks 
payable to Texas A&M Foundation.  For UT, make them payable to University of 
Texas at Austin (why do they always have to 
call it UT at Austin, like anyone would assume you meant UT Arlington when 
you say UT?).  Anyway, ANY contributions will be 
GREATLY appreciated.  Call me at x54915 and I'll be glad to come get them, or 
stop by my location at EB652b.

Thanks!

Class of '99 (A&M)
