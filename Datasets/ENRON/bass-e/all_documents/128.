Hi Folks,

As we head into your FF Playoffs, weather is a real factor in many games.
Knowing how it will affect your players can be huge.  With that in mind, I'm
pleased to introduce our Weather Guru, Mike McVay.  Mike's a Meteorologist
with WOWK - TV in West Virginia.  He also happens to be a very successful
Fantasy Football Fanatic.  What a deal.  Not unlike when I call on my
Physician friends for injury advice, Mike will offer his expert insights to
give you a sneak peek at how the weather may affect key games.

I'll see you early Thursday morning with our Matchups to Avoid and Exploit
and Players in the News.  In the meantime, here's an early look at some
developing weather situations that could affect your players this weekend.
Thanks Mike!

SEATTLE @ DENVER:  This one is worth monitoring.  The last game at Mile High
this year could get interesting.  A major snow storm will be brewing in the
Rockies on Sunday and heavy snow could cause problems for both the Seahawks
and Broncos.  Safest bets here are with the RBs.  What initially looks like
a high scoring game on paper, may actually become a ground game with a lot
of turnovers resulting in a low final score.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  More snow potential here.  Not a major storm, but
possibly enough to once again affect the passing game.  I'd shy away from
QBs and WRs if you have better options.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  This game will be ugly for the fans at Arrowhead. A
cold, steady rain with temps in the 30s for the start of this one.  The
Chiefs can't run the football, so this one could get interesting. Carolina's
Defense might actually be worth a gamble in this one.

CINCINNATI @ TENNESSEE:  Showers are likely throughout the game, but with
these two teams it shouldn't matter.  They both like running the football
anyway.

NEW ENGLAND @ CHICAGO:  I think the rain/snow will hold off until after game
time in this one.

PHILADELPHIA @ CLEVELAND:  Slight chance for rain/snow showers, but
shouldn't affect the game much.

TAMPA BAY @ MIAMI:  Slight chance for showers, but both of these teams are
used to this kind of weather.
