Statement by Governor George W. Bush
November 22, 2000

"I am disappointed with last night's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court.  We 
believe the justices have used the bench to change Florida's election laws 
and usurp the authority of Florida's election officials.  We believe the 
court overreached. Writing laws is the duty of the legislature; administering 
laws is the duty of the executive branch.

"Two weeks after the presidential election, a court has decided that
Florida's deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a
deadline at all. The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes 
that have already been counted at least two times, and in some cases three or 
four times, will continue more than a week after the law says it should. And 
the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this.

"The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language. But make no
mistake, the court rewrote the law. It changed the rules, and it did so after 
the election was over.

Statement by James Baker III, Senior Advisor, Bush-Cheney Recount

"At Monday's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court,
Justice Harding asked a key question about Florida's electoral
laws and standards: "Is it right to change the rules in the
middle of the game?"

"The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral
boards have now decided to do just that.

Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count
Dimpled Ballots, So...

 ~ For the past week, the Gore campaign has been saying that
   the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of
   this election.  But now that they didn't get a decision
   exactly to their liking, the Gore campaign is backpedaling
   and saying that they will leave all their options open.

 ~ In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be
   counted as votes, the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke
   case in Illinois, but the Illinois case didn't talk about
   dimpled chads at all. It involved hanging chads, the
   standard that these three counties began using and the
   standard that they are now seeking to change.

 ~ There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas
   governing manual recounts.  In Texas this would all be over
   because Texas only allows one manual recount, and it has
   very clear and objective standards.  The first of those is
   when you see light coming through, and the second of those
   is where you have a hanging chad. It's only in the third
   instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any
   consideration of a dimpled chad, and it doesn't say that a
   dimpled chad can be considered standing alone. It says it
   can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a
   clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote.

 ~ With its decision, the Florida Supreme Court has decided
   to 'change the rules in the middle of the game.'

 ~ The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both
   the executive and legislative branches.  They effectively
   rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida
   Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly
   belonged to the Florida Secretary of State.

 ~ This decision by seven Democrat justices completely
   politicizes the vote-counting process by putting the fate
   of this election in the hands of the six Democrats, two
   independents and only one Republican that control the
   Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this
   election, the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the
   rules in three counties that are still conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ Statistical experts have said that under the current
   standards, Gore will not get enough votes to overcome
   Governor Bush's lead.  So now the Gore campaign is looking
   to change those standards in the middle of the process.

 ~ The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a
   slight indentation.  No hole in the ballot is necessary.
   No single loose corner is necessary.  Not even seeing any
   light through the ballot is necessary.  This lenient
   standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent
   enough votes to overturn the election.

 ~ Ten years ago, the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in
   Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots
   should be counted that stated, "But a chad that is fully
   attached, bearing only an indentation, should not be
   counted as a vote."  Now Democrats want to unfairly change
   those rules.

 ~ The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes
   they need is to keep changing the rules.  This is unfair
   and unacceptable.  This election must be decided by the
   rules that existed on Election Day, not the rules
   rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged
   environment two weeks later.

The Washington Post
SEND IN THE THUGS
Michael Kelly
11/22/00

Excerpt:
"Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida, he will have come
very, very close to winning. Moreover, he will have done this
with his image-skin more or less intact. For Gore has already
won an astonishing propaganda victory: With the help of
reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and
liberal national press corps, he has managed to spin his
extraordinary, radical, unprecedented behavior as reasonable -
and legitimate. This probably ensures that future close
presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers,
marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies
of lawyers and thugs, demanding recounts, rewriting the rules
and the laws, convincing more and more Americans that their
electoral system is, like those in most of the world, just
another rigged game.

Thanks, Al, we needed that."

The Palm Beach Post
Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996
Joel Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post
11/22/00

Excerpts:
"Amid the swarm of the world press outside the county Emergency
Operations Center, Dennis Newman leads the charge to find new
votes for Al Gore in the dimples of the Palm Beach County
ballot.

"His argument, put simply, is that dimples show the true intent
of the voter. Voters caused those dimples. Dimples should count.

"Four years ago, in a similar election spat, Newman took a much
different stand. Employing his best legal tactics on behalf of
a Democrat holding a slight lead in a primary race for
Congress, Newman scoffed at the idea of counting the tiny
indentations as votes.

"Like the Republicans watching now, Newman wondered out loud how
ballots that had been handled over and over, in recount after
recount, could still be impartially judged. Couldn't the
ballots -- and therefore the votes -- be affected by all that
touching and grabbing?
