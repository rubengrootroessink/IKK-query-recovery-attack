Hi Folks,
?
I'll?have the full blown matchups very late  tonight / Friday morning but for 
you last minute waiver wire watchers, here's  something you might be 
interested in:? Chris Warren might be worth a shot  as the Eagles have signed 
him as anticipated according to the AP.? Full  article is below.? I'm betting 
he's still got something left in the  tank.? I'm also betting coach Andy Reid 
is smart enough to figure a way for  him to contribute in some fashion. 
McNabb is not a QB that must be overly  protected so the fact Warren may not 
know all the pass protection blocks isn't  quite as critical as it normally 
is.? He could be worth a  shot.
?
See you Friday morning,
?
Joe

From the article: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/eagles/thurs.htm?  The 
Philadelphia  Eagles have said for weeks that they're not looking ahead to 
the NFL playoffs.  But by adding recently waived running back Chris Warren on 
Thursday, the Eagles  may be thinking about what they need to succeed if they 
reach the postseason.  The Eagles claimed Warren one day after he was waived 
by the Dallas Cowboys.  

Warren, in his 11th NFL season,  will join the Eagles for Friday's practice 
and will be available Sunday against  the Cleveland Browns. 

''He's been in the league 11 years and at one  point he was one of the best 
backs in the game,'' Eagles head coach Andy Reid  said. ''Is he that now? I 
don't know. But he's a big back who has played well  this season.'' 

In Dallas this season, Warren rushed for 254 yards and  two touchdowns and 
averaged 4.3 yards per carry He also caught 31 passes for 302  yards and a 
touchdown. 

But in last Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay, Warren  misplayed a pass that 
deflected off his hands and was intercepted and returned  for a touchdown. He 
was benched after that play, and then was involved in a  shouting match with 
a Dallas coach on the sideline. 

Three days later, he  was waived. Dallas owner Jerry Jones said Warren 
''wasn't in the plans moving  forward,'' but Warren said he was cut because 
he wouldn't accept a one-year  contract extension for 2001 at his current 
salary, $715,000. 

Now Warren  is an Eagle. Philadelphia is looking to add a spark to a running 
game that has  been struggling since the season-ending injury to running back 
Duce Staley in  October. 

The running-back-by-committee group of Darnell Autry, Stanley  Pritchett and 
Brian Mitchell has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in the  last four 
games. Philadelphia, 9-5 and needing just one win in games against  Cleveland 
and Cincinnati to make the playoffs for the first time since 1996, has  
relied on quarterback Donovan McNabb almost exclusively to make the offense 
go.  

McNabb is averaging nearly 75% of the team's total offensive output.  

Warren began his NFL career in Seattle and ran for more than 1,000 yards  in 
four consecutive seasons, 1992-95. He made three Pro Bowls during that time.  

Seattle's career leading ground gainer, Warren has 7,654 yards rushing  in 
his career, which began in 1990. 

Warren signed with Dallas as an  unrestricted free agent prior to the 1998 
season. He has been a backup behind  Emmitt Smith the last three seasons. 

To make room on the active roster,  the Eagles waived wide receiver Alex Van 
Dyke.
