COMMISSIONERS, REMEMBER TO SET YOUR PLAYOFF MATCHUPS

When your league's regular season ends, the site will not
generate your playoff schedule automatically. The
commissioner must set the playoff matchups manually by
accessing the Schedule, Matchups toolbar link in the Front
Office, choosing the week the playoffs begin and then
entering the matchups. Nothing else needs to be changed.
Once the commissioner enters the matchups, all owners can
view them on the Schedule, Playoffs page.


CONSOLATION MATCHUPS DURING PLAYOFF WEEKS

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. So why leave the
non-playoff teams on the sidelines? Commissioners can set
not only the playoff matchups, but consolation matchups as
well, under the Schedule, Matchups link in the Front
Office.


PLAYOFF INFORMATION

Go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoff
tournament starts and how many rounds it lasts. If you were
lucky " make that skillful " enough to make the playoffs,
go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams
with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which
players will be available for you.

PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS FROM OUR FANTASY "GURU"

Take a break from pre-game trash talking and let our "guru"
have a say. Go to Schedule, CommGuru for a "tale of the
tape," comparing your starters to your opponent's, position
by position. The "guru" will predict the winner of the
matchup and a final score. In addition to adding spice to
your trash talking, it could also help you decide who to
start and who to bench. Tweak your lineup and go back to
see if the guru's prediction changes. If so, you may want
to consider changing your lineup accordingly. Of course,
the guru isn't perfect, but he can help you with those
tough decisions.


CUSTOMIZE YOUR REPORT SETTINGS

Did you know you can customize the settings of most
reports on the site, and save those settings so they are
displayed each time you visit the report? For example,
suppose you'd like the Transactions, View report to display
only Add/Drops over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter
those settings, click GO and then click the "save" icon
displayed over the report. Now each time you go to
Transactions, View, the report is displayed according to
your custom settings.

Football Season is Planters Season. Don't get left on the
sidelines. Planters brings you TWO ways to win! Click here:
