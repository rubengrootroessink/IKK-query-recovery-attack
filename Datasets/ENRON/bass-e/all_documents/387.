Three heavily Democratic counties continue to handcount
ballots that were meant to be counted by machine.

As the process continues, it has become apparent why
machines are used to count these ballots.

There have been reports of Bush ballots in the Gore
pile, counters using ballots as fans, and chads on the
floor and on the counting tables....

Cick here to watch a member of the Miami-Dade County
Canvassing Board bend, scratch, poke and press a
ballot during the manual recount...

Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words....
