 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision

his injured foot.

tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00

fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two

 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on

enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00

rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00

nine-year veteran signed a three-year free-agent contract with Vancouver in 
the off-season. Grizzlies general manager Billy Knight said he is not 
contemplating a deal for Massenburg.  Massenburg is a bruising rebounder but 
will have very little Fantasy value wherever he plays.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Payton has been the ultimate Ironman in his career with the Sonics.  His 
game against Orlando marked the 319th consecutive start for him, dating back 
to March 18, 1996, the longest active streak in the NBA.  The last game he 
missed was March 15, 1996, against Dallas when he served a one-game 
suspension that snapped his career-high consecutive games played streak at 
354.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/08/00

spasms.  He played 31 minutes without aggravating his injury, scoring 12 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.     

 Howard Eisley , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 He is backing up Steve Nash at point guard but head coach Don Nelson is 
using Eisley to finish games for Dallas.  Fifty-five percent of Eisley's 
total points and 41 percent of his assists this season have come in the final 
12 minutes of the game.  He scored 10 of his 14 points in Monday's game 
against Denver in the fourth quarter.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00

knee.  He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against

the Wizards. He had five points and eight rebounds in Chicago's 88-83 loss.   
 

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sabonis could be back for part of the Blazers' Eastern Conference swing, 
which begins Monday in New Jersey.  He has missed all four of the Blazers' 
regular season games while he recovers from a knee injury.

 Geiger, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, went 
through his first full practice yesterday at the Philadelphia College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.  He is eligible to come off the disabled list after 
tomorrow night's game, but the team hasn't disclosed any definite date as to 
when he will return.    

 Sherman Douglas , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Douglas twisted his left ankle slightly during practice on Monday, but is 
expected to be available tomorrow night when the Nets visit the Wizards. He 
is averaging 7.3 points, 1.0 assists and 1.3 rebounds through three games 
this season.      

 Tom Gugliotta , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Gugliotta went through his first practice on Monday since having major 
recontructive knee surgery eight months ago.  He damaged both his anterior 
cructiate and medial collateral ligaments in a game against Utah last March.  
He hopes to begin playing in games in about two weeks.   

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/07/00

play on Thursday night against the Suns.  He missed most of the preseason and 
the first four games of the regular season after suffering a mild case of 
malaria.

Knicks in a meeting with league officials on Monday.  In the meeting, 
officials described exactly what the NBA's tampering rules were, and how they 
apply to players.  No disciplinary action was taken against the Knicks' 
forward.    

 Darvin Ham , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Ham will miss 3-4 months after undergoing foot surgery on Monday.  He 
injured the foot while going up for a rebound against the Pistons on Saturday 
night.  Ham averaged 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in his first 
three games of the season.  He will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
either Tim Thomas or Jason Caffey.      

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/07/00 
 Doctors have cleared Coleman to return to the court for the Hornets on 
Wednesday against the Magic.  He missed the entire preseason while adapting 
to new medication for his irregular heartbeat.  Head Coach Paul Silas said 
that Coleman wouldn't start Wednesday's game, but that he would get some 
playing time.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Celtics on Monday after the team released Greg 
Minor.  He played in 54 games over the past two seasons with the Knicks, and
