Hi,

If you have a minute, I'd really
appreciate your assistance as I start
planning for 2001.  I waited until now
to ask as I think the playoff
contending folks are the cream of the
crop when it comes to our customers.

I'm interested in the features this
year you found most useful on the
cheatsheets.net site.

Follow the instructions, click on the
link provided, and please vote for a
few of the things you found the most
valuable and important to you. There is
not a set number of items you must
choose.  Just pick the ones you like
the most.

Thanks for your help and good luck this
week!

PS. I also ask a couple of bonus
questions at the end.  Interested in
your thoughts there.

Joe
