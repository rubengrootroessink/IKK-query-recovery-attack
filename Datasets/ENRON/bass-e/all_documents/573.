Each year, we all dress up like ancient Indian warriors and perform an 
elaborate ritual in which we sacrifice a chosen damsel to Vulcan, god of fire 
and metalworking.  Congratulations!  (sorry about your luck, Eric)

I didn't realize that there was a "tradition".  Remember- I wasn't in y'alls 
little picture around this time last year.  What does the tradition consist 
of?
