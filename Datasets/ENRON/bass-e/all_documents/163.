 Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
 that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
 lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
 robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

 The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
 on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
 "Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
 escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
 by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889."

 After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
 consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
 picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
 image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

 The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
 Associated Press as follows:

 "Gunther Gore was a famous
 rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
 grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
 and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
 Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
 service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
 his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
 a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
 Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
 civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
 he was standing, collapsed."
