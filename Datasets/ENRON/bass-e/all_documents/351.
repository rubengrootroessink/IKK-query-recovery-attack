Dear Friend,

Thousands more Americans have signed their Petition to
Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.electionIntegrity2000.com . We=01,re building a tidal
wave of public support for fairness and integrity in the
aftermath of this presidential election.

Make no mistake, Al Gore=01,s team of lawyers and activists are
fighting to the finish in a desperate attempt to overturn the
results in Florida.  Here=01,s the latest:

After hand picking Florida counties to conduct recount after
recount and using the Florida Supreme Court to help them
rewrite the election rules, it still didn=01,t look like Al Gore
was going to be able to manufacture enough votes to win.  But
they want this election and they=01,re not giving up without a
fight.

Statistically, early returns from the manual recounts (hand-
counts) did not show Al Gore overtaking George W. Bush=01,s lead
in Florida.  So the Democrats have simply changed the
"hand-counting" rules again.  The new rules say that ballots
with dimples, loose chad or any indentation in the area of
the box should be counted.

No punch hole in the ballot is necessary for Gore to gain
a vote!

This amounts to mind reading because the activists conducting
the recount are allowed to divine the intent of the voter.

Gore=01,s team argues that "every vote should be counted" hoping
to gain votes in their favor, but they use every technicality
to disqualify thousands of military ballots delivered without
a post mark.  Why?

Because these ballots likely favor Bush at a rate of 2 to 1!

And even though military servicemen abroad can=01,t control how
their mail is delivered, Gore=01,s allies are fighting to deny
their votes.

We the American people must fight this systematic and
calculated effort to overturn the election.  We must fight
in the media.  We must fight in the courts.  We must fight
in the Florida legislature.  We must fight for public
opinion.

One way you can help is by urging your friends and family to
join our online campaign to Certify the Bush Victory at
