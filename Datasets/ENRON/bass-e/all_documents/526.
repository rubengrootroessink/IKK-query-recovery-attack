Good evening. I am hopeful it is no big deal. This is a spot on my left leg.
I had a biopsy a couple of weeks ago and this spot is very active. So, they
have scheduled surgery on Thursday. It is Moies Surgery. They take out the
obvious contaminated area, immediately do an analysis, and if there is still
contamination on any part, they go back in an take out more until the lab
test are clean. Will not know how much leg they take until it is all over.
So, if you have a peg leg that you are not using, I may need to borrow it. I
do not expect any complications. Will let you know the results Thursday p.m.
Love you-Dad
