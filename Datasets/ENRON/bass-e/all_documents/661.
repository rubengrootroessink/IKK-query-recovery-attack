HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact,
Telluride has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the
temperatures have been frigid?which makes for excellent snowmaking
conditions. Winter has come, and you know what that means ? YES! Time to
strap on some boards and make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine
the local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked
out the window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop
with our waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But
when the other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with
the anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak
preview, check out the photo of the day at
www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And
that's what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some
of America's biggest hubs:

Dallas Special:          $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing
and roundtrip air to Montrose
Houston Special:    $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Chicago Special:    $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Miami Special:      $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and

To get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT'S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski
Resort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that
every lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep.
Lifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing
from beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be "tasty."

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred's, a new
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.
Sophia, Allred's will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the
evenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For
dinner reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It's easier to get to Telluride than ever
before. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on
American Airlines?but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your
body is in one of them!


WHAT'S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November
22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning.
Like the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you
can ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program.
What's it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at
participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can
choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free
half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call
888-288-7360.

And if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference
Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like
Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was
the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the
Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the
snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran
outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute
embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built
their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot
nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best
for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride,
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on
the slopes!

Rosemerry


WHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?
Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six
years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She
lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for
getting first chair of the morning.
