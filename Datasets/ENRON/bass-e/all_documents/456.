 Latest NBA Player News 

 Lee Nailon , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Hornets activated Nailon from the injured list today after placing Otis 
Thorpe on the injured list. Nailon has been out since the start of the season 
with right ankle tendinitis.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Thorpe was placed on the injured list by the Hornets today with a strained 
left foot. He had played in six of Charlotte's eight games this season, 
posting a 3.0 ppg average and a season-best eight points against New Jersey 
on November 4.  

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Dudley left Thursday's game with a sprained left ankle 3 1/2 minutes into 
the contest and did not return.  He could be sidelined for up to three 
weeks.  Daniel Santiago will probably start at center in his absence.     

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/16/00 
 Webber did not practice Wednesday due to a sprained left ankle, and is 
doubtful for Thursday's game.  He did not play in the Kings' win over the 
Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.  Scott Pollard will start at power forward if 
Webber is unable to play.      

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 LaFrentz is suffering from a contusion on his left hand and is questionable 
for Thursday's game against Chicago. If LaFrentz can't play Keon Clark will 
start at center. LaFrentz has been inconsistent this year averaging 10.3 
points and 6.6 rebounds per game but is still one of the better Fantasy 
centers.    

 Eduardo Najera , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Najera has had a diminished role with the Mavericks since starting at small 
forward in the season opener.  Dallas has sinced moved Greg Buckner into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard and placed Michael Finley at small forward 
in Najera's place.  Najera played a season-low 10 minutes against the Suns 
Wednesday.  He may be re-inserted into the starting lineup to shake things 
up.  Dallas has lost three out of its last five games.    

 Michael Finley , F DAL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/16/00 
 Finley's shooting woes continued against Phoenix Wednesday.  He scored seven 
points and shot 3-for-16 from the field.  In the past four games, Finley has 
made just 33 percent of his shots.  His current slump could be attributed to 
the fact that he played small forward in those games.  He played well against 
San Antonio, matching up with the 6-7 Sean Elliott but struggled to get his 
shot off against taller more athletic small forwards in the next three games 
against Peja Stojakovic, Lamar Odom, and Shawn Marion.  It may be wise to 
stay away from Finley until he regains his shooting touch or moves back to 
shooting guard.        

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Miles did not play in Wednesday's game against the Knicks.  Head coach Alvin 
Gentry chose to go with a more experienced lineup and started Tyrone Nesby at 
shooting guard.  Keep and eye on this situation.  This could lead to a 
diminished role for Miles.    

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 During the offseason he was touted as a potential savior for the Suns at the 
center position, but has been a major bust.  Tsakalidis still needs more time 
to develop and has played in only half of the Suns games so far.  If you 
drafted Tsakalidis you may want to give up on him for now and add a center 
that plays on a regular basis.    

 Shawn Marion , F PHO - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Marion had a monster game against the Warriors Wednesday.  He scored 19 
points, grabbed 19 rebounds, and blocked five shots.  Marion has been a major 
sleeper in the early part of the season, averaging 19.0 points and 10.6 rpg.  
If you have him on your Fantasy team hold on to him and start him.    

 Antawn Jamison , F GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Jamison started at small forward for Golden State Wednesday matching up 
against Minnesota's Wally Szczerbiak.  He started at power forward in the 
game prior to that.  Jamison will alternate at the forward spots until 
starting power forward Danny Fortson returns from his foot injury.  His 
scoring will remain about the same but look for Jamison to grab more rebounds 
at the power forward position.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip in Tuesday night's game against the 
Kings.  He spent much of Wednesday getting treatment, which will continue 
today before a decision on his availability for tonight's game is made. "If I 
had to guess now," said McGrady, "I'd say I'm going to try and play...we'll 
see."    

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/16/00 
 Jones missed last night's game in New Jersey with a strained calf.  He 
suffered the injury in the fourth quarter on Tuesday night against the 
Hornets. He considers himself "day to day."   

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Rose sat out of Wednesday night's game against Detroit after the team's 
medical personnel had determined that his injured left wrist was not yet 
sufficiently healed.  Rose, who was expected to play in the game, will now 
likely wait until sometime next week to return to action.    

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 The Cavaliers today waived Bryant, a 12-year veteran who had not appeared in 
a game this season. The 35-year-old forward-center had been on the injured 
list since October 30 with patellar tendinitis in his knees.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Livington was signed by the Golden State Warriors today after they placed 
Danny Fortson on the injured list. The 25-year-old was a free agent after 
posting 4.8 ppg, 1.6 rpg and 2.2 apg in 79 games with Detroit last season.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 The Warriors placed Fortson on the injured list today with a sore right 
foot. The league's leading rebounder, Fortson's injury is on the same foot he 
broke last season. Golden State signed free agent point guard Randy 
Livingston to take his roster spot.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Majerle said that he will miss "at least" two more weeks after re-injuring 
his left hamstring during Monday's practice.  "Obviously, I came back too 
soon," said Majerle, who was hoping to play in Tuesday night's game against 
Charlotte before the injury occurred.    

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Wallace left practice early on Tuesday after being hit in the face by an 
unidentified teammates' open hand.  He suffered a swollen right eye, but 
should be available for Wednesday night's game against the Pacers.  

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 Rose is expected to be in the starting lineup tonight for Indiana's Central 
Division matchup with the Detroit Pistons.  He has missed the Pacers' first 
six games after breaking his wrist during the preseason.  Fantasy owners who 
drafted Rose should be thrilled by his return, and hope he can duplicate his 
solid numbers of a year ago.  

 Rashard Lewis , F SEA - Fear Updated 11/15/00 
 With rookie Desmond Mason out of the mix at shooting guard, Lewis may spend 
some time at the position.  He has played mostly small forward in his career 
but started at shooting guard during his rookie season.  Lewis has shown some 
proficiency shooting from the outside.  He scored 22 points against the 
Knicks Tuesday hitting 4-of-7 three-point attempts.  His versatility may be 
valuable in a league where playing players at multiple positions is 
allowed.    

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Patterson replaced rookie Desmond Mason as the starting shooting guard 
Tuesday.  Mason who had been relatively unproductive as a starter was benched 
and did not play.  Patterson scored 10 points and grabbed four rebounds.  He 
is not known for his scoring but can pad his stats with rebounds, assists, 
and steals.  Patterson might be worth adding to your Fantasy team if you play 
in a deep league.     

 Brent Barry , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Barry has finally joined the Sonics lineup after missing the first six games 
with a sprained ankle.  He came off the bench and scored 14 points and had 
four rebounds in Tuesday's game against the Knicks.  Barry lost his starting 
shooting guard job in training camp but will continue to come off the bench 
until head coach Paul Westphal decides he wants to shake the lineup up 
again.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Sabonis was impressive in his season debut for the Blazers Tuesday.  He came 
off the bench and scored 12 points in 13 minutes.  Sabonis had been sidelined 
for the first eight games due to torn cartilage in his left knee.  Look for 
Sabonis to continue to come off the bench for Portland and play less minutes 
this year.  He will still give you you points, rebounds, blocks, and assists 
making him valuable as far as centers are concerned.     

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mills missed Tuesday's game against Cleveland due to a sore back.  He 
remains questionable for Wednesday's game at Minnesota.  When he does return 
he may be inserted into the starting lineup at small forward.  Starting power 
forward Danny Fortson will miss the next three games due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mullin was inserted into the starting lineup Tuesday against the Cavaliers 
at small forward alongside Antawn Jamison.  Playing in just his second game 
of the season, Mullin scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds.  He will 
most likely remain in the starting lineup until starting power forward Danny 
Fortson returns.  But the void in the starting frontcourt may also be filled 
by Chris Mills.  The 37-year old Mullin is still a solid shooter but his lack 
of quickness makes him a liability on defense.  His poor defense could cost 
him minutes of playing time.     

 J.R. Reid , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Reid was activated on Tuesday, filling the roster spot left vacant by Wesley 
Person, who is out with an elbow injury.  Reid has missed Cleveland's first 
six games with tendinitis in both knees.  

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Person was placed on the injured list on Tuesday with a bruised right 
elbow.  He averaged 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds over his first five games of 
the season.  His spot on the roster will be filled by J.R. Reid.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip flexor during Tuesday night's game in 
Sacramento.  He was injured in the first half, and played only 14 minutes 
after halftime.  "Right now I'm in a lot of pain," said McGrady.  "I don't 
know if I'll be able to go Thursday."  

 Cal Bowdler , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Bowdler was removed from the injured list today, filling the roster spot 
left by Roshown McLeod, who is out with an undiclosed ailment.  Bowdler has 
missed Atlanta's first eight games with a sprained MCL.
