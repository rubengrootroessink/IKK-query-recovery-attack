TO ALL ELECTION INTEGRITY INTERNET ACTIVISTS:

Keep it up! The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.

It's only a matter of time before they're going to have to
back off on their support for Al Gore and join the call for
him to concede.

For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayor
of El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliation
from Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirty
tactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.

Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, "Over 600,000 servicemen
and women gave their lives in this last century to ensure
American freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this same
right. I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when the
leader of the Democratic Party, supported by other elected
Democrat officials take this position. This is the final
straw. I didn't leave my party - my party left me."

It's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore and
even elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.

And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.  Disenfranchising the
military is as low as you sink.  As American citizens we owe
a debt of gratitude to the military.

The least we can do is defend their fundamental right to
vote.

If you want more info on this issue, go to

The site is sponsored by the United States Justice
Foundation a non-profit legal foundation that's suing the
Florida Elections Commission to make sure military votes
are properly counted.  They're also trying to put pressure
on the House and Senate Armed Forces Committees to fully
investigate why and how many military ballots were tossed
out of the Florida Election.

I highly recommend that you check out this site and send
any of your friends or relatives who are in the military
to that site also.

For Election Integrity,
