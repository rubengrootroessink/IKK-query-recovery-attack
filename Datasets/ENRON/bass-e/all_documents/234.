Dear Eric,

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election
at ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

For Election Integrity,
Bruce Eberle

Dear Bruce,

The liberal media is at it again.

They used every trick in the book to try to help Al Gore win
on election night.

And following a vote that didn't come out the way the
liberal media wanted it to... the media used their massive
influence to drum up controversy in Florida to try to
overturn the whole election.

On election night, the network media shamefully tried to
influence the election by declaring Al Gore the winner in
Florida before the polls were closed in that state -- and
hours before the polls were closed in the rest of the
country.

And the media all but declared Gore to be the overall winner
based on his "win" in Florida and other early states.

This clearly biased move led to thousands of discouraged
George W. Bush voters in Florida and other swing states to
leave long poll lines BEFORE they voted.

Who knows what the outcome might have been in Florida and
other swing states such as New Mexico, Oregon, and
California if the media had not falsely declared Gore to be
Florida's winner so early.

And then the media tried to overturn the most crucial swing
state -- Florida -- by inventing controversy and scandal
there.

The liberal media has always been biased...

.. but never before have they so blatantly tried to rig an
election in favor of their liberal candidate.

And who knows what tricks they may still have up their
sleeve to overturn the election and put Al Gore in the
White House.

Believe me, until the last Gore lawsuit is dismissed, the
liberal media will cling to the hope of getting their man
elected despite the actual outcome of the election.

That's why Radio America is so important.

giving truthful, unbiased election information.
