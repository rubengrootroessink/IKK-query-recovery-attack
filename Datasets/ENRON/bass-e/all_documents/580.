Dear Loving Son,

I'm glad you are having a good month.  That does not surprise me.  Perhaps
we should turn what's left of your inheritance over to you to invest.  Just
kidding.  Dad is doing a great job but this market is really jittery over
this election mess - thanks to the Dems.

Bi-weekly sounds good.  Let's do that.

Have a great day.  Talk to you later.  LU-Mom
