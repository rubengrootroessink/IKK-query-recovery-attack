 Latest NBA Player News 

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  "If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him," said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage 
in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.  
With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to 
search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.  He 
averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the 
Hornets to a 4-0 week.  Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early 
in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your 
league.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an 
injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.  He won't travel with the 
team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.  
With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for 
Carter until he is healthy.       

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 
 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position 
in Monday's game against Vancouver.  In what has been called the "big 
backcourt," Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the 
shooting guard.  Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he 
could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point 
guards.     

 Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the 
Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' 
two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring 
punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup 
change.      

 Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.  
He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt 
that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.  Despite the 
injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.  With the success of 
so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his 
Fantasy value.  He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners 
in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.    

 Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.  He 
sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  
Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value 
in most leagues.  His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers 
is uncertain.     

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the 
Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.  X-rays on Atkins' 
ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New 
Jersey is still unknown.    

 Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games 
with a knee injury.  He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on 
September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.  Unless you are 
desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of 
Fantasy.     

 Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee 
against Atlanta on Wednesday night.  He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds 
in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the 
Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. 
The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. 
Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by 
swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn 
hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. 
 

 Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 
 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of 
his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman 
Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on 
the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.   

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 
 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday 
night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The 
fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.   
McGrady's status is day-to-day.    

 Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 
 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to 
repair frayed cartilage.   Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the 
source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst 
near the rear of the knee joint.   Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 
before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 
weeks.    

 Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee 
Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no 
real Fantasy value.     

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 
 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   DeMarr Johnson will probably 
start at shooting guard in his place.  Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the 
only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.     

 Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday 
before their game against Toronto.  Terry Mills was activated form the list 
to take Perkins' place on the roster.  Jermaine O'Neal will start at center 
in Perkins' absence.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 
 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left 
ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is 
probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 
 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had 
been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, 
keep him in your active lineup.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 
 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will 
be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.
