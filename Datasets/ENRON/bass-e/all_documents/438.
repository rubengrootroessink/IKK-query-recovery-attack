Hi Folks,

Sorry to send another email but I've had a few AOL folks tell me the
Matchups To Avoid and Exploit reports I sent last night were not readable.
If you were unable to read the email, you can access the Passing Game
Matchups online here http://www.cheatsheets.net/update111700.htm and the
Rushing Game Matchups online here
http://www.cheatsheets.net/update111700b.htm

Apologies for the trouble.  I'm trying to see what's causing this.  If we
have any AOL experts out there who think they can see what's happening, I'd
appreciate your insights.  You can reply to this message.  Thanks.

Players in the News Report is coming soon.

Thanks and I hope you have a great weekend.

Joe
