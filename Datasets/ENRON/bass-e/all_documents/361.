AND coast-to-coast U.S. travel for $198 roundtrip, or less.

the decks for a  four-day weekend. Bestfares.com will be posting new deals
throughout the holiday, but we=01,ll make this newsletter short and sweet,
whet your appetite with the best of our specials and leave you with room
for delicious desserts of deals. Our hot, new Caribbean sale can save you
up to 60 percent in the most popular travel season, and you still have
time for last-minute savings on Turkey fares. Without further ado, we=01,ll
serve up our buffet of bargains.

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get
back some of the money the airlines have gotten for your business trips by
using our coast-to-coast $198 Super Sale fares. Access more information at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149
roundtrip; 1,001-1,250 miles for $139 to $169 roundtrip; and over 1,250
miles for $151 to $189 roundtrip. Get the big end of the holiday dinner
