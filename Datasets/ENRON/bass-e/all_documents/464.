Once--in March, in Riadosa, NM.  People were literally skiing in tank tops
and shorts.  I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10
times easier than Colorado slopes.  Needless to say, I'm a little nervous
about how well I will do.  But I am extremely excited about going.  When I
did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on
because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues
successfully and one black semi-successfully.  My biggest fear of all is the
cold.  I HATE COLD WEATHER!!  It should be interesting.  On top of it, I'm
extremely excited becase this will be my first vacation I have EVER taken.
Yipppeee!!!

Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.  I
am excited because I haven't experienced real winter like conditions for 3
years.
Have you been skiing before?
