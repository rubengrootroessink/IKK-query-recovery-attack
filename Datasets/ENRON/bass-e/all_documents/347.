DON'T WAIT FOR THE SCORES

If you're like a lot of us, you're tracking your fantasy
team via Live Scoring while watching the games on TV. Did
you know that Live Scoring can also track the real-time
scores of all the NFL games? Go to Live Scoring, NFL Games
and avoid waiting for the out-of-town scoring updates on TV.


THE TOP PERFORMERS

Want to see where your players rank among the top scorers
in your fantasy league? Go to Statistics, Player Scoring.
Initially, you'll see a list of your players, in point-
scoring order. Choose "All Teams" and "All Positions" from
the listboxes above the report to view every player in the
league, ranked by fantasy points, and see how your players
stack up. If your trading deadline still hasn't passed,
you can view the top scorers at a specific position, to
help you decide which player to target.


MILLER LITE

The tab for SportsLine's FREE Fantasy Football is being
picked up by Miller Lite, our favorite beer around here.
Check them out offline at your local bar or online with us.
Grab a Miller Lite. It's Miller Time!

GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.


PLANTERS

Football Season is Planters Season. Don't get left on the
sidelines. Planters brings you TWO ways to win! Click here:

MONITOR THE TRANSACTION WIRE

Go to Transactions, View to stay on top of every player
move in your league. The page will display all your
league's transactions, sorted by the date they were
entered. If your league charges transaction fees, they will
be displayed as well. You can sort the report by team, by
transaction type (only IR moves, only add/drops, etc.) and
by time period. Try to monitor the transaction wire as
often as possible, so you don't miss out if another owner
releases a potential sleeper.
