Dear Eric,

Keep up the good work!  Election Integrity 2000 is already
over 254,000 petitions to Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  We're going to see this thing through to the end
so please continue to spread the word.

Fortunately, there are many other groups out there fighting
to prevent Al Gore from stealing this election.  I'm
forwarding an e-mail I just received from the editor of
Newsmax.com describing their emergency campaign to get the
truth out.  Check it out!

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Dear Concerned American:

The major media are not telling the truth about this
election and the serious vote fraud that has taken place.

Al Gore is trying to steal this election and the liberal
media are helping them.

NewsMax.com has set up an Emergency Fund to take out ads
across America to directly inform the American people about
this election and Al Gore's attempt to overturn the election
results.

It's critically important we bypass the major liberal media.

Already NewsMax has taken ads out in major newspapers like
USA Today. We plan on more ads on the web, in major papers,
and even ads on TV and radio.

If you want to help or just want more information, please
read NewsMax.com's Urgent Letter.

This is important. Al Gore is planning to take this to the
Electoral College. We need to act now.

Thank you.
