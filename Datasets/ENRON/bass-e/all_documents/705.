Hi Folks,

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch,  identifying those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making  the playoffs or watching from the sidelines.? As=
=20
we head into our 11th week  of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both  the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make  sur=
e=20
you understand, what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? In=
=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Upgrades and Downgrades.? Some of these players are obvious moves up or  do=
wn=20
and some aren't as clear.? Here's my list of guys I see moving this  week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Jeff  Blake (NO)?? Heard a funny thing on ESPN's Monday Night  Pregame=
=20
show.? The guys said that with the troubles in St. Louis, the road  to the=
=20
Super Bowl now runs through New Orleans.? It's been a while since  you've=
=20
been able to say that.? Blake struggled in the preseason but has  become mo=
re=20
comfortable with each game.? With a great rushing game  featuring Ricky=20
Williams and a star WR in Joe Horn, Blake's looking great.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? Shannon Sharpe predicted that when the Ravens =20
finally scored a TD, they'd score a bunch of them.? The big TE was  prophet=
ic=20
as Dilfer threw for 3 TDs Sunday.? He scrambled, improvised, and  made=20
excellent decisions.? A little confidence may be all he needed.?  He doesn'=
t=20
have a stellar WR corps with Qadry Ismail, Jermaine Lewis and Patrick =20
Johnson but he does have a great TE in Sharpe and a solid RB in Jamal =20
Lewis.?=20

QB Brian  Griese? (Den)? As expected, Griese's recent off the field  troubl=
es=20
had little impact to his performance on the field.? 327 yards and  a couple=
=20
of TDs is strong against a good Jets team.? The biggest reason for  his=20
upgrade though is the smashing return of RB Terrell Davis.? If Sunday  was=
=20
any indication, this offense could make some serious noise.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? With back to back solid games, Shaun King is turning =
=20
some heads.? He only passed for 110 yards Sunday but squeezed every yard  f=
or=20
all it was worth with 3 TDs.? He continued to target Keyshawn Johnson  even=
=20
to the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldn't have been =
=20
thrown.? It's tough to rely on a QB who plays in this conservative offense =
=20
but if you're thin at QB, King might be worth a shot.

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Miller clearly gave the Bears a boost with his solid =
=20
play Sunday.? Not only was he more accurate than the injured Cade McNown,  =
he=20
showed a better arm to boot.? Miller's gain will be McNown's lost and I  lo=
ok=20
for Miller to gain plenty over the next few weeks.

QB Danny  Kanell (Atl)? Kanell came in when Chandler left with a =20
concussion.? He played pretty well with 2 TDs on 218 yards.? Chandler  look=
s=20
to possibly miss this week's game and Kanell could be a nice play against  =
a=20
Detroit Defense.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? He's made this list several times already this =20
year?but it's worth noting how good he's been lately.? Sunday's 2 TD /  125=
=20
yard day earned him the #1 RB ranking in many scoring systems.? I don't  se=
e=20
many reasons why he won't have continued success.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den)? In one of the more heartening performances of the =
=20
day, Terrell Davis looked great.? He showed the power and the burst that =
=20
we've come to expect from Davis over the years.? Coach Mike Shanahan said =
=20
during last week's practices that Davis looked as good as he'd ever seen =
=20
him.? After watching the game, I have to agree with him.?=20

RB J.R.  Redmond? (NE)?? According to coach Bill Belichick and  Boston Glob=
e=20
columnist Frank Dell'Apa, Redmond injured his foot during practice  and was=
=20
supposedly going to be limited Sunday.? Kevin Faulk was  unimpressive early=
=20
and Redmond never looked back after getting a chance.?  He's productive=20
without being impressive as he only averaged 2.8 yards per carry  on 24=20
attempts but did get the score.?=20

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? Much had been made of the Raven's troubles but Jamal=
 =20
Lewis had been running hard and effectively.? Lewis was held out of the =20
endzone once again but he rolled up 179 total yards with 109 rushing and 70=
 =20
yards receiving.? If Trent Dilfer and the passing game can keep things =20
rolling, I see no reason why Lewis can't hold up his end of the offense.

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? As you know by now, Marshall Faulk had knee surger=
y =20
Monday and will miss 2-3 weeks.? We've had Watson on our Waiver Wire Wonder=
 =20
list for a while as the guy who'd get a shot if Faulk went down.? He was =
=20
less than impressive yesterday with only 12 yards on 12 carries but he did=
=20
get  the TD.? Plus, coach Mike Martz said the game plan had been designed=
=20
around  Faulk and the skills he brings.? Look for Watson to perform better=
=20
with a  week to prepare.? Although Marshall Faulk is the only guy who'll gi=
ve=20
you  Faulk like numbers anytime soon in this offense.

RB Warrick  Dunn? Dunn had 18 carries Sunday and he continues to play a=20
bigger  role in this offense. It's coming at the expense of Mike Alstott.? =
It=20
seems  strange to see Dunn carry the load but that's exactly what he's been=
 =20
doing.? After the Minnesota game last week, Keyshawn Johnson said he told  =
QB=20
Shaun King that he needed to get the ball to "19 and 28" (Johnson and  Dunn=
)?=20
King evidently listened.? Makes you wonder who's really  coaching this team=
...

RB  Jermaine Fazande (SD)? Fazande looked to be in danger of losing  carrie=
s=20
last week but he responded Sunday with a nice day carrying the ball 22  tim=
es=20
for 74 yards (3.4 ypc) He also tacked on 37 yards receiving.? The  Chargers=
=20
are still struggling but Fazande could be a nice addition if you're  thin a=
t=20
RB.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)?? Johnson told QB Shaun King he wanted  the ball.=
?=20
King obliged and Johnson's made the most of it.? He only  had 3 receptions=
=20
for 47 yards but he managed TDs on 2 of those catches.? I  don't look for h=
im=20
to score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch  but I do thi=
nk=20
he could continue the roll.? You can bet the Bucs won't mess  around with=
=20
what's working for them.

WR Joe  Horn (NO)? Can you imagine if Elvis Grbac still had Joe Horn in  KC=
??=20
QB Jeff Blake's certainly glad to have him and Horn surely likes the  role =
of=20
the #1 WR.? He put together a great game Sunday with 167 yards on 9 =20
receptions.? WR Keith Poole isn't carrying his share of the load but RB =20
Ricky Williams is more than making up for it.

St. Louis  WRs? I'd look for Isaac Bruce, Az-zahir Hakim, and Torry Holt to=
 =20
all increase their production in the wake of Marshall Faulk's injury.? =20
Synergy can be a strange thing.? On most teams, I'd view the loss of the =
=20
star RB as a negative toward the WRs.? The Rams have so many passing  weapo=
ns=20
though, I think they can carry the team with a lesser RB in the  backfield.=
?=20

WR Donald  Hayes (Car)? Apparently, the loss of Wesley Walls can be =20
overcome.? Hayes made some great plays Sunday.? Not unlike Keyshawn  Johnso=
n,=20
he only caught 3 passes, but he made the most of them with 58 yards and  a=
=20
TD.? He looks to be back on track.

WR Muhsin  Muhammad (Car)? I received a few emails asking how in the world =
=20
could I continue to rank Muhammad as high as I did last week.? He's good, =
=20
that's how.? Sure, the Rams had something to do with his play (and the =20
ranking) but I like his activity.? He caught 6 passes for 83 yards Sunday =
=20
night and should continue to play well.

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? I said a few weeks ago that Mason could be the bes=
t =20
WR on the team.? Now I'm sure of it.? Of course, it's a team that  doesn't=
=20
throw the ball very well and when they do throw, the TE is the primary =20
target.? Still though, he's a solid contributor and you could certainly do =
=20
worse at WR.? His special teams play is a nice bonus if your league let's =
=20
you "double dip" the WR and special teams categories.

WR  Laveranues Coles (NYJ)? Coles continues to play great  football.? He=20
ranks as the #26 WR over the last 3 games.? Keep an eye  on him for keeper=
=20
leagues as his play is very encouraging considering his lack  of experience=
.?=20
He should only get better.

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? I told you Robinson doesn't seem to care who's =
=20
throwing the ball and Robinson came through Sunday with 90 yards and a TD.?=
 =20
New QB Jim Miller definitely gave the Bears a spark and Robinson benefited=
=20
from  it.? Don't be surprised to see him keep it rolling.

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Shannon  Sharpe?(Bal)? Sharpe led the charge as the Ravens came  roaring=
=20
back.? He's clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet  QB Trent=
=20
Dilfer will continue feeding him the ball.

TE Ricky  Dudley (Oak)? Dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our =
=20
weekly cheatsheets.? Even though he made the downgrade list a couple of =20
times, we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on  potential=
.?=20
Dudley finally showed some of that potential Sunday with a  couple of TDs.?=
=20
It's worth noting that he scored 9 TDs in 1999.? 7 of  them came in the=20
second half of the season.

TE Jay  Reimersma? (Buf)? Reimersma seemed less rusty Sunday as he  hauled=
=20
down 6 receptions for 49 yards.? Flutie will probably get another  start th=
is=20
week and look for him to continue leaning on the big TE.

?

Players  Moving Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Donovan  McNabb?(Phi)? McNabb only completed 56% of his passes  Sunday.?=
=20
And even for the ones he completed, he only averaged 9.9 yards per =20
completion which is a bad sign.?? He doesn't seem to be?making  the=20
improvements and progression you'd like to see from a QB with his =20
experience.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? Batch was banged around repeatedly Sunday.? He =20
eventually left with a concussion and his status for this week will be =20
determined probably by Wednesday.? You've probably seen it by now, but  coa=
ch=20
Bobby Ross resigned.? I doubt that'll have too much effect on the  offense.

QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Bledsoe suffered a very Brett Favre like banged up =
=20
thumb as he hit a defender's helmet.? He was in obvious pain on the =20
sidelines and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play.? X - rays=
 =20
were negative but he's still hampered by it.? They'll make a decision on it=
 =20
this week but even if he can go, he could be limited.

QB Chris  Chandler (Atl)? Once again, Chandler was led off the field lookin=
g =20
punch drunk.? It wasn't pretty.? Danny Kannell actually played pretty  well=
=20
and could get the start this week.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? As expected, the dream became reality vs a tough =
=20
Baltimore defense.? I traded him in my league last week and hope you did  t=
he=20
same.? I'll say it again, a RB can only do so much when there is  absolutel=
y=20
no threat of the QB throwing the ball.? Akili Smith is world  class awful.?=
=20

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? As Warrick Dunn becomes a bigger part of the Buc =20
offense, Alstott is playing a reduced role.? Part of the reason is likely =
=20
his fumbling problems but the effectiveness of Dunn is playing a part I'm =
=20
sure.? That and Keyshawn said to give it to Dunn...

RB Kimble  Anders (KC)? The "featured" back in KC had 2 carries Sunday.? =
=20
Never ever trust a Kansas City RB.? No matter what I might tell you in the =
=20
future, don't believe it.? They'll break your heart every time.?=20

RB Travis  Prentice (Cle)? Prentice averaged 1.4 yards per carry  Sunday.?=
=20
That won't get it done. Like a lesser version of Corey Dillon,  beware RBs=
=20
with QBs who don't scare anyone throwing the ball.? Doug  Pederson doesn't=
=20
scare anyone...=20

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Johnnie  Morton (Det)? Morton's inability to take up the slack for the =
=20
departed Germane Crowell has been a huge disappointment.? He came up small =
=20
again Sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the future.

WR Herman  Moore (Det)? Let's put it this way:? JJ Stokes is the #4 WR  in=
=20
San Francisco and he had a better day than Moore...

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Like Alstott is suffering in the wake of Warrick =
=20
Dunn's success, Green is suffering as Keyshawn Johnson commands more =20
attention.? He only had 2 receptions and simply isn't getting the looks he =
=20
was earlier in the year.

WR Raghib  Ismail (Dal)? In what's become the uncomfortable norm, Dallas ha=
s =20
lost another WR to knee surgery.? There was so much promise this Summer  wi=
th=20
Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail.? Things  can=20
change quickly.

WR Carl  Pickens (Ten)? Pickens injured his hamstring again this  week.? I=
=20
was high on him coming over to the Titans but he's been a non  factor.?=20
Derrick Mason is the best WR on the team.? By a mile.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Chad  Lewis (Phi)? After a hot start, Lewis has struggled of late as =20
defenses bracket him.? With no WR to take some heat on the downfield  route=
s,=20
it's not too hard to shut down the TE.?? Until McNabb and  Charles Johnson?=
/=20
Torrance Small get going, his troubles will likely  continue.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? McGee should be a nice weapon for the struggling QB =
=20
Akili Smith but he doesn't seem to be utilizing him as you'd expect.? He =
=20
caught only 2 passes Sunday.? The sad part is that almost made him the =20
leading receiver.?=20
