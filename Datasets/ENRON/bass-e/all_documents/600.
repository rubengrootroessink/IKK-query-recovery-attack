 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/13/00 
 While completing 20 of 25 passes, Garcia threw for 244 yards with no 
interceptions, and ran for a pair of short touchdowns. In a fine performance 
against a talented Chiefs defense, Garcia showed a new dimension as a 
scrambling threat near the goal line. If defenses try to pressure him into 
making mistakes, Garcia can burn them with his legs in the red zone.   

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Klap Updated 11/13/00 
 Reaching triple digits for the first time since the 1998 playoffs, Anderson 
ran for 119 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. Don't expect too many more 
outstanding performances from Anderson this year. He is still not running at 
full throttle and may not completely look like his old self until next 
season.  

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Eric Bass Updated 11/13/00 
 In addition to running 20 times for 111 yards, Smith caught four passes for 
53 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown. The Minnesota RB seems to be hitting 
his stride just in time for the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup 
every week.  

 Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Baja Updated 11/13/00 
 On the heels of his big game against Minnesota, Freeman was held to 36 yards 
on four catches. Most secondaries will continue to frustrate Freeman, who 
simply lacks a solid No. 2 WR across from him. Defenses won't be surrendering 
the big play to Freeman in these final games, because he is the Packers' only 
legitimate deep threat.      

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an uninspiring performance, Batch completed just 12 of 27 passes for 128 
yards with no touchdowns and one interception. The Atlanta defense has been 
vulnerable all year long, and Batch's struggles against the Falcons prove he 
is not a reliable Fantasy QB for these final weeks, even as a backup.     

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 On four catches, Johnson gained just 18 yards. He was not an integral part 
of Philadelphia's 23-point day, a major outburst for such a sporadic and 
unproductive offense. Johnson shouldn't be in your starting lineup if you 
need key wins in these next few weeks.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an unnaccountably poor performance, Smith ran for just 16 yards on 17 
carries while losing a fumble. Such awful numbers against the defenseless 
Bengals raise major warning signs. Opponents will make Dallas beat them with 
the pass, and will be dedicated to smothering the run.      

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie back ran three times for just four yards while losing a fumble, 
and caught two passes for 18 yards. Despite a coaching change, the Cards have 
still not figured out how to properly utilize Jones, who needs more of a 
lateral, wide-open offense to succeed.      

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Rallying Seattle from a 14-point deficit, Kitna completed 22 of 33 passes, 
throwing for 231 yards and three touchdowns without an interception. It was 
eaily one of his best outings in recent memory, but Kitna seems destined to 
return to the bench once Brock Huard is healthy again. Don't expect another 
fine outing from Kitna anytime soon, because Huard is on the verge of being 
able to return.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In one of his better passing displays, McNair completed 21 of 34 passes for 
228 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran four times 
for 34 yards. If Eddie George continues to battle injuries, McNair may be 
asked to carry the Tennessee offense in the weeks ahead.   

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie wideout caught just one pass for four yards. Burress has been 
extremely ineffective this year, and don't be surprised if his playing time 
is cut drastically very soon.   

 Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 Completing 24 of 33 passes, Brunell threw for 340 yards and one touchdown 
while running for a two-yard score himself. Good numbers against a bad 
Seattle pass defense. Brunell has looked better recently, but will still 
struggle against stronger opponents. Despite his good numbers, the Seahawks 
wer able to disrupt his timing on key downs.   

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The second-year passer completed just 10 of 25 passes for 63 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception. Those numbers look particularly awful when 
you consider Smith was facing the talent-starved Dallas defense.      

 Trent Dilfer , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Despite throwing a potentially crushing interception that was returned for a 
fourth-quarter touchdown, Dilfer led the Ravens to victory again by 
completing 23 of 36 passes for 281 yards with the one interception and two 
touchdowns. A solid performance against Tennessee is enough proof that Dilfer 
should be a servicable backup in these final weeks.      

 Leslie Shepherd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The veteran wideout caught just two passes for 19 yards. Poor totals against 
a soft San Diego secondary is an obvious sign that Shepherd shouldn't be in 
any Fantasy lineup this late in the year.  

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/12/00 
 Running 13 times, Smith picked up just 29 yards. With the running game 
sputtering, Smith is getting another chance from the Bills' braintrust, but 
it doesn't appear weeks of inactivity have improved his outlook any.  

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/12/00 
 Toomer suffered a concussion in Sunday's loss to the Rams. He did not play 
in the second half.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Leaf left Sunday's game against Miami in the fourth quarter with an apparent 
ankle injury. He was replaced by Jim Harbaugh. Leaf had replaced an injured 
Moses Moreno earlier in the game.  

 Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Reserve RB Trung Canidate left Sunday's game against the Giants in the third 
quarter after injuring his left wrist.    

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Favre left Sunday's game at Tampa Bay in the third quarter with a sprained 
left ankle. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck and later taken to the locker 
room on a cart.  Some published reports say Favre will miss one game, and 
maybe two.   

 Dave Moore , TE TB - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moore left Sunday's game against Green Bay. He suffered a concussion and 
Mike Alstott lined up at TE in his place until he returned in the third 
quarter.     

 Reggie Jones , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Jones left Sunday's game against Miami with an apparent knee injury. His 
injury came shortly after QB Moses Moreno had left the game as well.   

 Moses Moreno , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moreno left Sunday's game against Miami with a strained left knee. He was 
replaced by Ryan Leaf.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Wilkins left Sunday's game against the Giants after injuring his hamstring.  
Jeff Hall will handle the placekicking duties in his absence.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Owens is playing today against the Chiefs but did not   start. J.J. Stokes 
started in his place opposite Jerry Rice.   

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Alexander left Sunday's game at san Francisco in the first half with a 
concusiion. He returned in the third quarter.   

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Ayanbadejo re-injured his toe in Sunday's game against the Titans.  Sam Gash 
replaced him at fullback.    

 Thurman Thomas , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Thomas sprained his knee in the second quarter of Sunday's game against the 
Chargers.  He was carted to the locker room and will not return.  Autry 
Denson replaced Thomas as the third-down back.    

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/12/00 
 Holcombe did not play in Sunday's game against the Giants.  RB James Hodgins 
started at fullback in his place.      

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 After rushing for 93 yards, Williams left Sunday's game in the fourth 
quarter with a broken left ankle.  He will be sidelined for six to eight 
weeks.  There have also been reports of possible ligament damage. Chad Morton 
should be the featured back in his absence. New Orleans might also use Jerald 
Moore and there is speculation they might take a look at Ki-Jana Carter.
