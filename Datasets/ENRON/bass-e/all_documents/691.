 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Pickens was unable to play the full game Sunday against Pittsburgh after 
re-injuring his hamstring. He didn't have a catch for the second straight 
week, the first time in his career he has done that. If Pickens can't play 
Sunday, the ailing Titans will probably struggle against the tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sanders, who was forced to leave Sunday's game against Pittsburgh with 
strained rib cartilage, may be limited in practice this week, but will likely 
play next Sunday against Baltimore. He had four catches for 70 yards in the 
game, and should continue to serve as one of the Titans' top two receivers 
(with Derrick Mason) as long as Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen are ailing. 
If Tennessee is forced to turn to another option, the only players left are 
inexperienced Chris Jackson and Chris Coleman.  

 Tony Martin , WR MIA - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Martin is expected to return to action this week against the Chargers.  He 
has been recovering from a stress fracture in his right foot that has kept 
him out of six games this season.    

 Al Del Greco , K TEN - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Del Greco missed a 24-yard field goal last Sunday against Pittsburgh, 
breaking a string of 46 straight from within 30 yards dating back to 1994. 
Still, he atoned for the miss by kicking the game-winner, a 30-yarder to 
close out the game, and added two other field goals. No reason to downgrade 
his value at this point.  

 Dolphins , DT MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/07/00 
 The Dolphins' defense put up another stellar effort on Sunday, holding the 
Lions to only eight points while playing at one of the NFL's toughest 
stadiums, the Silverdome. The Fish recorded two sacks, an interception, and 
recovered two fumbles in the game, while holding the Lions to only 268 yards 
of total offense. In injury news, linebacker Zach Thomas will miss this 
Sunday's game against the Chargers and may not be ready to play until after 
Miami's November 19th date with the Jets.  He is still recovering from a 
severely sprained ankle.  On a better note for Miami, defensive tackle Tim 
Bowens is expected to return to practice this week and will likely play 
against San Diego.        

 Steelers , DT PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 The Steelers' defense held Tennessee to nine points Sunday, and extended its 
streak of not allowing a touchdown to 20 quarters. Despite a mistake late in 
the fourth quarter that allowed the Titans to win the game, the Steelers gave 
Fantasy owners another solid performance. Pittsburgh sacked Steve McNair once 
and intercepted him another time in the game. Expect another solid outing 
next Sunday, when Philadelphia comes to town.  

 Colts , DT IND - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 It looks like defensive end Ellis Johnson will miss his second consecutive 
game this week when the Colts host the Jets on Sunday night.  "I don't know 
about Ellis," said Head Coach Jim Mora, "I kind of have my doubts."  Johnson 
is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.        

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 11/07/00 
 Harrison took a wicked hit to the back at the end of Sunday's game in 
Chicago, and complained of a stiff upper neck on Monday.  The injury isn't 
considered serious, and Harrison is expected to play this week against the 
Jets.  Against the Bears, Harrison caught six passes for 42 yards but was 
held out of the end zone for the first time in three weeks.  It was also the 
first time in five games that Harrison has been held under 100 yards 
receiving.    

 Kent Graham , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Although he won't start Sunday against Philadelphia, Graham is likely to get 
another shot at the job if Kordell Stewart doesn't improve. Graham averaged 
208 passing yards in his first three games, while Stewart is averaging 128 
yards in his four starts. Neither will take your Fantasy team to a league 
title.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Coach Bill Cowher named Stewart his starter for Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, despite a disappointing 112-yard passing game last Sunday. If 
Pittsburgh can't get it's air game going, expect Kent Graham to be 
re-installed as the starter over the upcoming weeks.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Edwards didn't record a single reception Sunday against Tennessee, and in 
fact, dropped a key pass during the game. With his recent struggles, it's 
likely Hines Ward and Bobby Shaw will get the majority of the passes the rest 
of the way.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/07/00 
 The Bills' defense held the Patriots to only 13 points on a cold and rainy 
day at Foxboro.  They sacked New England quarterbacks three times and 
recorded two interceptions as well, while keeping the Bills in the game with 
some tough goal-line stances.  On the injury front, defensive end Phil Hansen 
has been able to walk without crutches, but his sprained knee is expected to 
keep him out of action for another three to five weeks.     

 Cory Geason , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Geason will be sidelined for at least the next few games with a sprained 
left knee ligament. The Steelers, who have few other blocking tight ends on 
the roster, may need to sign one.  

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Morris suffered a thigh bruise during Sunday's game against the Patriots.  
Despite the injury, he is expected to practice with the team on Wednesday. 
The rookie running back complied 86 yards of total offense in Buffalo's 16-13 
overtime victory.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Bettis had just 42 rushing yards on 13 carries against one of the stingiest 
run defenses in the league, Tennessee, on Sunday. It was his lowest total 
since he had just eight yards in Week One against Baltimore. As a side note, 
Pittsburgh could be without center Dermontti Dawson for the rest of the 
season, and certainly will for at least the next few games due to a hamstring 
injury. Keep in mind that Bettis posted the lowest rushing yards total of his 
career (1,091) with Dawson missing nine games last season. We're not 
condemning Bettis, as he's still having a great season, but it's probably 
worth considering benching him against tougher defenses the rest of the way.  

 Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the Rams 
on November 20th. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, 
while Barber has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee.      

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Johnson will miss Washington's next game, a November 20th contest in St. 
Louis on Monday night.  He is not expected to return the Redskins' starting 
lineup until November 26th against the Eagles.  Head Coach Norv Turner, in an 
attempt to avoid a quarterback controversy, has already stated that Johnson 
will be the starter when he is healthy enough to play.     

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/07/00 
 George completed 20-of-39 passes for 276 yards but threw  two interceptions 
in Sunday's loss to the Cardinals.  He will likely start Washington's next 
game on November 20th against the Rams while starter Brad Johnson recovers 
from a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Cowboys' Head Coach Dave Campo said that he probably won't know until 
Wednesday if Aikman will be ready to go this Sunday against the Bengals.  The 
Cowboys' quarterback was scheduled to have a series of injections on Monday 
to relieve the inflammation in his lower back.  "As tough as he is," said 
Campo, "I wouldn't put it past him to be ready to go."    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The Cards' defense put up a heroic effort on Sunday, holding the Redskins' 
offense to just 15 points in their big NFC East win.  In the game, cornerback 
Aeneas Williams returned a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown, tying the NFL 
record for the longest fumble returned for a score.  On the downside, Arizona 
placed defensive tackle Tony McCoy on the injured list, losing him for the 
remainder of the season. He had missed three games after having arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee.  He will be replaced by Barron Tanner, whom the 
team signed as a free agent.    

 Pete Stoyanovich , K STL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/06/00 
 The Rams released kicker Pete Stoyanovich on Monday, a day after he missed 
two field-goal attempts in a loss to Carolina.  He missed badly from 37 and 
50 yards in the second quarter in Sunday night's 27-24 defeat at home.   The 
Rams are now looking to sign Jeff Hall who will take over as kicker until 
Jeff Wilkins recovers from his injured quadriceps.      

 Kris Heppner , K WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 The Redksins cut rookie Kris Heppner Monday.  Heppner was released by the 
Seahawks earlier this season.  The Redskins have a bye this week and will try 
out a number of prospects.  Among the many kickers they are considering 
hiring is 44-year old veteran Eddie Murray.    

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Freddie Jones had another solid receiving week. He caught 5 passes for 86 
yards. Too bad he plays for a team with QB problems!  

 Justin Watson , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 Watson started in place of Marshall Faulk but didn't do tow well.  He gained 
just 12 yards on 12 carries but did manage to score on a short touchdown run. 
 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/06/00 
 Green was a Fantasy star once again this week, but in a losing effort.  He 
passed for a career-high 431 yards, completed 29-of-42 passes with two 
touchdowns and no interceptions.   

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Leading the Panthers to the upset win, Beuerlein  completed 15-of-25 passes 
for 214 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.  Overall Beuerlein 
hasn't been as successful as he was last season but he is still just as 
effective.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/06/00 
 Robinson was a reliable Fantasy player once again on Sunday.  He had nine 
catches for 109 yards and scored a touchdown against the Colts.    

 Jim Miller , QB CHI - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Miller led the Bears to victory while starting for the injured Cade McNown 
Sunday.  He completed 24-of-35 passes for 214 yards and a touchdown.   

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 The NFL's leader in touchdown receptions didn't catch one on Sunday but he 
was still productive.  He caught six  passes for 97 yards.  Owens still leads 
the NFL with 11 TD receptions.     

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Blake may have been the surprise star of Week 10, throwing three touchdown 
passes.  The Saints have generally relied on RB Ricky Williams to move the 
offense this season but they turned to Blake on Sunday and he did not 
disappoint.  Blake completed 20-of-26 passes for 275 yards.
