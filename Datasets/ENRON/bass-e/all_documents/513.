FOR THOSE OF YOU WORKING FOR US COMPANIES!!
 > -----NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 > To the citizens of the United States of America,
 > In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and
thus
 > to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of
your
 > independence, effective today.
 >
 > Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial
duties
 > over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except
Utah,
 > which she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon.
Tony
 > Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware
that
 > there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for

 > America without the need for further elections.  Congress and the
 > Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next
year
 > to determine whether any of you noticed.
 >
 > To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the
following
 > rules are introduced with immediate effect:
 >
 > 1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English
Dictionary.
 > Then look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You
will be
 > amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
Generally,
 > you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up
 > "vocabulary".  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with

 > filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and

 > inefficient form of communication.  Look up "interspersed".
 >
 > 2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft
know
 > on your behalf.
 >
 > 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian
accents. It
 > really isn't that hard.
 >
 > 4.      Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English
actors as
 > the good  guys.
 >
 > 5.      You should relearn your original national anthem, "God
Save The
 > Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not
want you
 > to get confused and give up half way through.
 >
 > 6.      You should stop playing American "football".  There is
only
 > one kind of football.  What you refer to as American "football" is
not
 > a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a
world
 > outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays
"American"
 > football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should
instead
 > play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played
with
 > the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough
will, in
 > time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American
 > "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty
 > seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).  We are
 > hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.
 >
 > 7.      You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear

 > weapons if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were
not
 > aware that there is a world outside your borders should count
yourselves
 > lucky.  The Russians have never been the bad guys.  "Merde" is
French for
 > "shit".
 >
 > 8.      July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will
be a
 > new national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called
"Indecisive
 > Day".
 >
 > 9.      All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it
is for
 > your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand
what we
 > mean.
 >
 > 10.     Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us
crazy.
 >
 >  Thank you for your cooperation.
