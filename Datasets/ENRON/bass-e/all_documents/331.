>If I do not like the count,
>I will simply throw them out!
>
>I will not let this vote count stand
>I do not like them, AL GORE I am!
>
>Can we change these numbers here?
>Can we change them, calm my fears?
>What do you mean, Dubya has won?
>This is not fair, this is not fun
>Lets count them upside down this time
>Lets count until the state is mine!
>
>I will not let this VOTE count stand!
>I do not like it, AL GORE I am!
>
>I'm really ticked, I'm in a snit!
>You have not heard the last of it!
>I'll count the ballots one by one
>And hold each one up to the sun!
>I'll count, recount, and count some more!
>You'll grow to hate this little chore
>
>But I will not, cannot let this vote count stand!
>I do not like it, Al Gore I am!
>
>I won't leave office, I'm stayin' here!

>all telling me that I should sue!
>We find the Electoral College vile!
>RECOUNT the votes until I smile!
>
>We do not want this vote to stand!
>We do not like it, AL GORE I am!
>
>How shall we count this ballot box?
>Let's count it standing in our socks!

>We cannot, cannot count enough!
>We must not stop, we must be tough!
>
>I do not want this vote to stand!
>I do not like it AL GORE I am!
>
>I've counted till my fingers bleed!
>And still can't fulfill my counting need!

>And I will not say that I am done!
>Until the counting says I've won!
>
>I will not let this vote count stand!
>I do not like it, AL GORE I am!
