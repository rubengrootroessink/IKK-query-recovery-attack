Hi Eric -

We will begin testing your index today.   The description for your index will 
read as follows:

"The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on such 
calendar day under the heading  "Daily Price Survey" in the 
East-Houston-Katy, Katy plant tailgate section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar 
day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint 
price published on the next suceeding Business Day. " 

The Product Short Description on the website will be as follows:

 US Gas Daily  KatyPltTailgate  Month/Year  USD/MM


Please advise if this does not meet with your approval.

Thanks - 
Rob

Rob,

I need to get a new gas daily product created.  This product will be settled 
daily against the Katy Plant Tailgate under the East-Houston-Katy subheading 
in Gas Daily.


Call with questions.

Thanks,

Eric
