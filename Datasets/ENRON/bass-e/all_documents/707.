  Dear Friend,

  I'm sending this e-mail to remind you Tuesday is election
  day.  You can make a difference in this election.   My
  husband, George W. Bush and all of our great Republican
  candidates will provide the kind of leadership to improve
  public schools, strengthen Social Security, rebuild our
  military and cut your taxes.

  This will be a close race; please take your friends and
  family to the polls and vote for George W. Bush and our
  Republican team this Tuesday, November 7.

  Thank you very much.

  Laura Bush
