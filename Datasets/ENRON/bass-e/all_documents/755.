Hi  Folks,

Week 10.? Crunch time.? In most fantasy seasons, this is the  week you can=

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.?=20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm=
 =20
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.??=20

Note:? I=01,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last f=
our=20
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mik=

Hall=01,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/ f=

Allowed by position.

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense??  Even with the  offensive=20
fireworks, the 49ers continue to lose games for one simple  reason:? They c=
an=01,
t stop  anyone.?  QB  Jeff Blakeand crew gets to  tee off on a defense that=
=01,s=20
allowed an average of 286 passing yards per game  over the last four weeks=
=20
which is dead last.? They make everyone look good and this  week should be =

by opposing QBs.

San Diego Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense?? This week, San Diego faces a =

Seattle team that=01,s in freefall.?  The defense ranks # 30 in passing yar=

allowed per game over the past  four weeks giving up 278 yards per game.?  =
As=20
odd as it may seem, QB Jim  Harbaughhas been a top 10  Fantasy QB over the=
=20
past couple of weeks throwing for 4 TDs and 509 yards in two  games.? The=

tricky part is to figure  out who=01,ll catch the passes.? In  week 7,?  WR=

Jeff  Grahamand  Curtis  Conwayhad great games  while TE  Freddie Joneswas =

the TE as Jones hauled in 2 TDs and 111  yards on 10 receptions.? I think =
=20
you=01,ll continue to see the distribution lean towards what we saw last we=

with  Freddie Jones as the primary target.?  On a side note, you have to lo=

Oakland Passing  Game vs Chief Defense? Over the last three weeks, Kansas=

=01,s=20
easy to look past San Diego on the schedule.? In their week 7 matchup, Gann=

numbers to speak of in that game (5 receptions for 89 yards but no  TD) and=

around.? If  you=01,ve hung with him this long, he=01,s probably worth star=

just on the chance  he breaks out but he=01,s been a huge disappointment. =
=20

Green Bay Passing  Game vs Minnesota Defense?? The Minnesota defense made=

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Bear Defense?? The Bears trail only San=20
Francisco  when it comes to giving up Fantasy Points to opposing QBs.? You=
=20
know I love Daunte Culpepper, but  Peyton  Manningwill be the best  QB they=

Jerome  Pathonand  Terrence  Wilkinsare distant  alternatives.? Of course =

to call as both Ken Dilgerand  Marcus  Pollardare  effective.? Pollard had =
a=20
big game  last week but he=01,s tough to depend on.

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Raider Defense?? These are two very good=20
football  teams that give up way too many yards through the air.? Kansas Ci=
ty=20
is averaging 267 passing  yards per game allowed over the past four weeks=
=20
while the Raiders are yielding  242 yards per game over that span.?  Elvis =
=20
Grbacis one of the  nicer stories of 2000 and he ought to continue his roll=
=20
in this one.? Grbac threw for 288 yards and 2 TDs in  their week 7 matchup.=

Derrick  Alexanderis the #1 WR and  provides great stability and=20
instruction.?  Rookie Sylvester  Morrismissed last  week=01,s game and he=

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

Carolina  Passing Game vs Ram Defense?? Wesley Walls or no Wesley Walls,  t=
he=20
Rams still are giving up 264 passing yards per game over the last four =20
weeks.? That lands them squarely in  the #28 slot.? Again, much of this =20
number is driven by the fact St. Louis forces team to throw the ball but th=
at=01,
s  not really important.? All that=01,s  important is that teams do throw t=

ball on the Rams.? And effectively.? QB Steve Beuerlein will sorely  miss=

Wesley Walls.? But he=01,ll have  to find someone to take up the slack.?  T=

situation is still muddy.? Kris Mangum=01,s shoulder is still a  big proble=

And Brian  Kinchen is more valuable as the long snapper.? Rookie Casey=20
Crawford could get  the start.? Pay attention because  St. Louis gives up=
=20
more fantasy points to the TE than all but one other team in  the league.?

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? Patriot LB Andy Katzenmoyer was =
=20
placed on Injured Reserve this week and that=01,s got to hurt.? Even with h=
im,=20
the Patriots had been  pretty weak in defending the pass.?  Over the last=

four weeks, they ranked # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game.? They=01,r=

Flutie could earn him the right to keep starting.? He=01,s impossible to sa=

passes which is the perfect scenario for Fantasy GMs.? Jeremy McDaniel has=

for both Reimersma and Flutie  owners.

Miami  Passing Game vs Lion Defense?? Detroit enters this game with a =20
defense that=01,s allowing 233 passing yards per game over the last four =
=20
weeks.? That earns them a # 23  ranking.? When ranked by number of  points=
=20

inconsistent making great plays followed by awful throws.? He=01,ll have to=

guys, but they do have a solid matchup.

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Over the past four weeks, Green=

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way

Detroit  Passing Game vs Miami Defense?? It=01,s hard to add up.? Sam Madis=
