This is probably the last update you will receive prior to election day.
Make sure to get out and vote for the arena and tell your friends, family
members, co-workers and total strangers to do the same!

----------
ELECTION RESULTS

For those of you not near a TV or unable to attend the election night party
(see below), Save Our Rockets and Comets is proud to bring you
up-to-the-minute election results right on the website beginning at 7pm on
Tuesday evening.

We will have updates as often as possible so you can follow the returns
right on your computer screen!  A big thanks to Dave from
http://www.ClutchCity.net and Randy from http://www.LiveHosting.com for the
help getting that done.

----------
MONDAY RALLY

The final rally of the election will be from 4pm to 6pm Monday afternoon at
campaign headquarters (downtown at the corner of Crawford and Clay).
Featured guests include Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and Rocket players
Steve Francis, Shandon Anderson and Walt Williams.

Come on down and give the arena vote one final send off!

----------
WORKING THE POLLS

Most of you already know that we will be out working the polling locations
on Tuesday.  If anyone is still interested in helping out, please let us
know and we'll get you hooked up.

Call me at 713-880-3733 for more info.  We can use any and all help that
day.  Thank you.

----------
ELECTION NIGHT PARTY

Everyone is invited to the official arena campaign election night party at
the Hyatt Regency's Regency Ballroom on Louisiana Street in downtown Tuesday
night.

The party gets started at 7pm and will last on into the night.  TV's will
broadcast election results all night (and hopefully the game!) and there
will be food and entertainment.

Thanks for all your support.  Now, get out there and VOTE!

-- Jeff
