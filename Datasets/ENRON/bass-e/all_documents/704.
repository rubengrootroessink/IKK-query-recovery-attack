FLY TO FLORIDA THIS HOLIDAY SEASON FROM $128 RT.
Just in time to gear up for holiday travel, we have new low fares to
Florida valid for flights beginning December 20 through January 9, 2001.
If you didn=01,t buy the cheap Florida fares we offered in August and
September, then you may now be experiencing the airfare ticket shock we
warned you about back then. The major airlines are now claiming to offer
discount fares through February 4, but their cheapest seats for travel
between December 20 through January 9, 2001 are already gone. The good
news is that we still have seats available to the sunny state of Florida
for as low as $128 roundtrip. Even though the published fares have no
cheap seats remaining, we have a way to get you there for less if you act
quickly. For instance, Dayton (OH) to Florida through Bestfares.com is
only $128 roundtrip. Most of our special fares are between $180 and $258
roundtrip.  For a sample of our inexpensive =01&Frugal Fares to Get You To
Florida,=018 visit:

HAWAII ON SALE FOR THE HOLIDAYS THROUGH FEBRUARY 15, 2001.
Yes, we have an assortment of excellent Hawaiian fares, but we want to be
upfront about availability. Certain cheap seats to Honolulu will be tight
between December 20 and 29, 2000, so act fast because we are currently
finding cheap fares to Kona and, on select holiday dates, to Maui. For
example, you can head to Maui or Kona from $395 roundtrip. Or how about
San Diego, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland (OR), Los Angeles or San Francisco
to Honolulu for an even lower $345 roundtrip? Fly from Dallas/Fort Worth,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis or Houston to Hawaii for $428 roundtrip.
From New York City, Boston, Washington (DC), Orlando or Miami, it=01,s $502
roundtrip. Check out our special fares to Hawaii. Travel is valid through
February 15, 2001. Be flexible and you can save a bundle. Click to:

FLY TO THE CARIBBEAN FROM $180 RT THROUGH MARCH 14, 2001.
We have some excellent cruise prices out of San Juan, Puerto Rico at the
moment. Combine this with our inexpensive airfare to San Juan as low as
$180 roundtrip through March 14, 2001, and you now have a double whammy
for a super Caribbean getaway! We have a great variety for you. For
instance, roundtrip airfare from New York City is $180, from Fort
Lauderdale $200, Orlando $246, Boston $252 and Chicago $286. Fly from
Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle or Las Vegas to San
Juan for $414 roundtrip. These airfares can be up to 50 percent off.
Travel between December 18 and January 8, 2001 is sold out. For further
information, visit:

SENIORS AND COMPANIONS COAST-TO-COAST FOR $248 RT OR LESS.
This week, some of the best deals in America are for seniors age 62 and
over. One of the greatest things about senior discounts is that they allow
a companion of any age to travel along at the same low price. Plus, the
good news keeps getting better when you discover there are only 10
blackout dates on these amazing airfares: November 21, 25, 26 & 27 and
December 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 & 27. That=01,s it! If you can fly around those
dates, there is a good chance you could save a bundle. Here are some
examples. Fly from San Diego, Orange County, Ontario (CA), San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland (OR) or Las Vegas to Boston, New York City, Washington
(DC), Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale or more for only $238 roundtrip.
Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans, Little Rock, Oklahoma
City or Tulsa to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or
Norfolk is just $142 roundtrip. Take a look at our =01&Seniors Fly for Less
Across the USA=018 specials. This is a great time to buy the parents or
grandparents a great holiday gift of airfare. Click to:

HOLIDAY FARES TO CANADA FROM $60 RT THROUGH JANUARY 7, 2001.
If you want to fly to Canada during Thanksgiving or the late December
holidays, we have airfares as low as $60 to the Great White North. Now
that=01,s something to shout about. From Seattle to Vancouver, you can fly
for $60 roundtrip. From Portland (OR), it=01,s $93 roundtrip. San Francisco
to Vancouver is $112 roundtrip. Cleveland, Detroit or Pittsburgh to
Toronto is only $85 roundtrip. Hartford to Montreal is also $85 roundtrip.
From Boston or Providence, it=01,s $100 roundtrip. Newark to Montreal is $9=
1
roundtrip. If you want an inexpensive holiday excursion, then consider
Canada for a great getaway. The American dollar is quite strong now, room
rates are low, and of course, we have super cheap Canadian airfares from
over 40 US cities. To take advantage of the savings, visit:

If you want to see city after city in Europe on a cheap buck there is only
one word to say and it=01,s =01&Eurofare.=018  Imagine flying from Paris to=
 Rome

flight for the same cities Eurofare is a great bargain! To qualify book a

30, 2001 and you can add up to six additional flights within Europe for
only $89 per flight.  Your originating transatlantic flight must depart by
March 31, 2001 and your roundtrip travel must be completed by April 7,
2001.
