Week of November 7, 2000
A Weekly Travel Newsletter from  TravelNow.com

Dear Eric,  
It's Election Day in the United States so we want to encourage  everyone to 
get out and vote! Unlike the current race, with  our vacation specials, you 
don't have to choose just one! You  can visit the home of the next President 
on our Washington DC  trip to the NBA All-Star game. Be a representative of 
your home  state on the new Love Boat cruise. Get away from all the talk  of 
taxes in the Cayman Islands. Whatever trip you vote for,  you know it will be 
a winner!

??TravelTips 
?
Luggage Weight
?

If you have a scale at home, and you know what the weight limit  is, then you 
can weigh your bags at home - and if your bag is too  heavy, then you need to 
lighten your load by removing non-essential  items. -Sabrina O.

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!
