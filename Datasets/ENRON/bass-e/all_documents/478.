I've reviewed the rules and brackets.... 

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page.
