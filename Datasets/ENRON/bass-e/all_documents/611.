...Hard to believe this was written by a high school  student...

A Columbine High School student wrote:

The paradox of  our time in history is that we have taller buildings,
but
shorter tempers;  wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints; we spend
more,
but have less; we  buy more, but enjoy it less.

We have bigger houses and smaller families;  more conveniences, but
less
time; we have more degrees, but less sense;  more knowledge, but less
judgment; more experts, but less solutions; more  medicine, but less
wellness.

We have multiplied our possessions, but  reduced our values.

We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too  often.

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added  years
to
life, not life to years.

We've been all the way to the  moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the
street to meet the new  neighbor.

We've conquered outer space, but not inner space; we've cleaned  up the
air,
but polluted the soul; we've split the atom, but not our  prejudice.

We have higher incomes, but lower morals; we've become long  on
quantity,
but short on quality.

These are the times of tall men,  and short character; steep profits,
and
shallow  relationships.

These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare;  more leisure,
but
less fun; more kinds of food, but less  nutrition.

These are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier  houses,
but
broken homes.

It is a time when there is much in the  show window and nothing in the
stockroom; a time when technology can bring  this letter to you, and a
time
when you can choose either to forward this  message and make a difference
or just hit delete.
