 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Marshall is suffering from a knee injury and is questionable for Tuesday's=
=20
game against the Raptors.  David Benoit will get extended playing time if=
=20
Marshall is unable to play.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Baker sat out Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a knee injury. =20
Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis got extended playing time in his absence. =
=20
Look for that to continue until Baker returns.  For now he is listed as=20
questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.   =20

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Sabonis missed Sunday's game at Phoenix due to a sore knee.  He has now=20
missed three games in a row and is questionable for Wednesday's game at=20
Toronto.  When Sabonis finally returns look for him to come off the bench f=
or=20
a few games before returning to his job as the starting center.  Dale Davis=
=20
will start at the pivot until then.  =20

 Hubert Davis , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Davis missed his third straight game Sunday due to a strained groin. =20
Courtney Alexander replaced him at shooting guard.  Davis is questionable f=
or=20
Tuesday's game at Houston.  When he finally does return to the lineup he ma=
y=20
find that Greg Buckner or Michael Finley has replaced him at the two-spot. =
  =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Nash sat out Sunday's game against the Lakers because of a bruised calf. =
=20
The Mavericks went with a backcourt of Howard Eisley and rookie Courtney=20
Alexander in his absence.  Nash is questionable for Tuesday's game at=20
Houston.   =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Buckner played for the Mavericks Sunday after missing seven straight games=
=20
prior to that with a sprained foot.   It will take him a while but Buckner=
=20
will become a productive Fantasy player again in a few weeks, if he is stil=
l=20
healthy.     =20

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Mullin is still suffering from a sore knee and missed his fifth consecutiv=
e=20
game Sunday.  If you have Mullin on your team hoping for a miracle Fantasy=
=20
season, it's time to let go.  It appears that Mullin won't be well enough t=
o=20
help a Fantasy team this season.    =20

 Chris Porter , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 With Chris Mullin and Chris Mills sidelined, Porter got the first start of=
=20
his career Sunday, playing small forward.  He responded by scoring 18 point=
s=20
and grabbing six rebounds.  Look out for Porter.  He is extremely athletic=
=20
and could develop into a surprise Fantasy star in the upcoming weeks.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Carter is listed as day-to-day with a sore left knee, but will accompany t=
he=20
team on its three-game road trip. Head Coach Lenny Wilkens said that Carter=
's=20
availability for the trip won't be determined until Tuesday. It may be a go=
od=20
idea to sit Carter this week until his return date is a bit more clear.    =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to practice with t=
he=20
team on Monday and may be available to play against the Celtics on Tuesday=
=20
night.  If Hill's injured ankle is still tender, however, he will likely wa=
it=20
until Orlando's West Coast road trip next week before returning. Fantasy=20
owners who have been waiting for Hill's return should keep him on the bench=
=20
until he has been cleared to play by the team.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Gill, who is currently stuck in a horrendous shooting slump, may find=20
himself either on the bench or being placed on the injured list. Gill has=
=20
been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, which has made him feel like=
=20
he is "playing on one leg."  Fantasy owners who were expecting Gill to be=
=20
productive should seriously consider benching him until he is healthy enoug=
h=20
to perform at a higher level. =20

 Fred Hoiberg , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Hoiberg is less optimistic that he will be able to play against the=20
Timberwolves on Tuesday after testing his sore left ankle in a workout on=
=20
Saturday.  He is listed as day to day, and hopes to return for Chicago's=20
weekend road trip through Texas. Hoiberg, like many of his Chicago teammate=
s,=20
holds very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Brand missed practice on Sunday after sustaining a left knee hyperextensio=
n=20
at the end of Friday night's loss to the Knicks. He will have an MRI=20
performed on Monday and is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game agains=
t=20
Minnesota. Brand leads the Bulls in scoring (18.8 ppg) and rebounding (10.4=
=20
rpg), and is one of the top forwards in the world of Fantasy.  Owners may=
=20
want to put Brand on their bench this week until the extent of his injury h=
as=20
been determined.  =20

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Herren has been placed on the injured list because of his sore shoulder, b=
ut=20
remains optimistic that he can return soon. "I'm going to rest it a bit and=
=20
see how it goes," said Herren. If the injury persists, surgery may be his=
=20
next option. Herren isn't a very value Fantasy player, so his injury won't=
=20
effect most owners.   =20

 Mitch Richmond , G WAS - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Richmond injured his right knee in Saturday's game against Miami, and didn=
't=20
make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game with the Pistons. He will have a=
n=20
MRI done on Monday to determine the extent of the injury.  If you have=20
Richmond on your Fantasy roster, it may be a good idea to keep him on the=
=20
bench this week. =20

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Washington Wizards, who traded Ekezie to the Clippers last week, have=
=20
picked him up off of waivers. Ekezie, who was released by the Clippers=20
shortly after the trade, had averaged 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in his=20
first stint with Washington.  He holds no Fantasy value.  =20

 Glenn Robinson , F MIL - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Robinson, one of three starters who began the game on the bench for missin=
g=20
a pregame meeting, scored 24 points as Milwaukee beat the Indiana Pacers=20
92-80 Sunday. Bucks coach George Karl kept Robinson, fellow forward Jason=
=20
Caffey and point guard Sam Cassell out of the starting lineup one day after=
=20
criticizing his team for its dismal play in a loss at Atlanta.   Cassell,=
=20
Robinson and Caffey were replaced by Lindsey Hunter, Tim Thomas and Jerome=
=20
Kersey, respectively.   When Robinson entered the game after watching the=
=20
first eight minutes, he missed his first five shots before finding his=20
touch.   =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/03/00=20
 Oakley was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 by the=
=20
NBA on Friday for punching Los Angeles Clippers guard Jeff McInnis during t=
he=20
morning shootaround.   He sat out Friday night's game against the Clippers,=
=20
and also will miss games in Utah on Tuesday and Portland on Wednesday.    =
=20

 Scott Williams , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Milwaukee Bucks activated Williams from the injured list. Williams wen=
t=20
on the injured list November 17 with lower back spasms. He had been startin=
g=20
at center until his injury but came off the bench Saturday, grabbing four=
=20
rebounds in six scoreless minutes of a 101-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. To=
=20
make room for Williams, the Bucks placed rookie guard Michael Redd on the=
=20
injured list.  =20

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Chicago Bulls activated Voskuhl on Friday and placed rookie guard A.J.=
=20
Guyton on the injured list with a sprained right knee.   =20

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Minnesota Timberwolves activated Hammonds from the injured list.  =20
Hammonds had been sidelined for the entire season with soreness in both=20
ankles. To make room for Hammonds, the Timberwolves placed forward Reggie=
=20
Slater on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee.   =20

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 MacCulloch was activated Friday by the Philadelphia 76ers and Pepe Sanchez=
=20
was placed on the injured list with bursitis in the left hip.   MacCulloch=
=20
was placed on the injured list Nov. 20 with tendinitis in his left ankle.  =
 =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Cleveland Cavaliers activated Knight from the injured list Friday. The=
=20
point guard had knee surgery Aug. 17. Cleveland also placed guard Michael=
=20
Hawkins on the injured list because of a sprained left ankle.  =20

 Bonzi Wells , G POR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Wells was suspended for Thursday night's game against Dallas and fined=20
$10,000 by the NBA for intentionally striking and verbally abusing an=20
official.   He will be back in the lineup for Saturday's game at Houston.  =
 =20

 A.J. Guyton , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Guyton sprained his right knee during the first quarter of Thursday night'=
s=20
game against Chicago. He will undergo an MRI on Friday, and will likely mis=
s=20
a few games due to the injury. Guyton is of no value in the world of Fantas=
y.=20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Interim head coach Nate McMillan has inserted Davis into the starting line=
up=20
at guard in place of Ruben Patterson.  This move was made more to improve t=
he=20
ballhandling and defense in the backcourt than for offense.  Davis will tak=
e=20
some of the pressure off Gary Payton in running the plays but he won't be o=
f=20
much help to Fantasy teams.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/01/00=20
 New coach Nate McMillan has made numerous roster changes since taking over=
=20
as interim head coach one of them has involved Baker.  McMillan has replace=
d=20
Baker in the starting lineup with F/C Jelani McCoy.  The move could help to=
=20
motivate Baker in the long run.  He seemed fired up against the Lakers=20
Thursday scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds.  But Baker must stil=
l=20
prove that he can be a consistent producer, put him on your bench until his=
=20
Fantasy production becomes more solid. =20

 Tyronn Lue , G LAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 The Lakers are considering offers for Lue.  He is currently on injured=20
reserve but the Sixers and the Magic have shown interest in him.  Lue could=
=20
develop into a somewhat valuable Fantasy player on either team where he wou=
ld=20
receive extended minutes as a backup.   =20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 With Tyrone Nesby traded to Washington.  Richardson moved into the startin=
g=20
lineup at shooting guard Wednesday.  He scored 18 points and grabbed eight=
=20
rebounds.  Keep an eye on Richardson.  If he continues to perform like this=
=20
he will be a nice Fantasy acquisition.  =20

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 Walker has been placed on the injured list due to a sprained left ankle. T=
he=20
ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.=
=20
Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is=
=20
only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.   =20
