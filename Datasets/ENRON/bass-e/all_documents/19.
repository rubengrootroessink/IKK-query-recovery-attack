 Latest NFL Player News 

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 "The Edge" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.  

 Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week. He 
will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.
