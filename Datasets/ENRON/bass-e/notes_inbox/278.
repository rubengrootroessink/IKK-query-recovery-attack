The last I heard was that each of the Enron teams from each school would play 
each other on a weekday night or something (I had heard this Wed. for the two 
A&M teams).  Then we might have the two Enron winners play each other, with 
the winner possibly playing the Andersen winner (if they decide to play).  
That's the latest I've heard though.  Webb Jennings was supposed to be 
calling Simmons about the rescheduling.

Have you heard anything about the reschedule date?
