Hi Folks,

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
"It hurts now," Davis said. "It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful."
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
"It didn't affect me at all," he said. "We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay."
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. "That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury," Turner
said. "Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it."

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
"tough guy" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about "leaders stepping
up" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.
