??TravelTips 
?
Labels, Labels, Labels
?

Print up a sheet of address labels with the name/address/phone  of your 
destination hotel, and your own name and email address.  Using the airline 
counter luggage tags, affix a label on each suitcase,  including carry-on. 
When traveling around your vacation spot, the  extra labels are very handy in 
a variety of ways and your luggage  is less likely to be lost. -Robert P.
