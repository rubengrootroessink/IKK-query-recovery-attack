Dear  Amazon Customer,  

Put  on your  dancing shoes and don your party hat. It's your  Amazon.com 
anniversary! That's right: a year ago you  placed your first order with us 
(using this account),  and we'd just like to say thanks. 

Since  your anniversary falls so close to the holidays, we  thought about 
e-mailing you a cup of eggnog. (In  the  dot-com world, we call it "e-Nog.") 
But the  tech folks  said that was impossible. So we opted  to share our 
favorite  customer-inspired holiday  services with you instead--including 
free  shipping.  May they make the season merry and  bright (and save you 
some money)!

Create  a Wish List. Feeling  lucky? Then create a  Wish  List (or update an 
existing one) and fill  it with your favorite Amazon.com finds. You just  may 
win everything on your list--up to  $10,000.

Meet  our Gift Wizard. Short on gift  ideas? Don't worry--we're big on 
solutions. Just  tell us a thing or two about the recipient, and  our   Gift 
Wizard will come up with a  wonderful  list of possibilities for you.

Send  a Free Holiday e-Card. Christmas,  Hanukkah, Kwanzaa--no matter what 
you're celebrating,  an Amazon.com  e-Card is simply a fantastic way to  
spread  a little holiday  cheer.

Visit                     the Holiday Essentials Store.  Looking for

spirit? Check out our Holiday  Essentials Store.

So  stop in and  discover the best the season has to offer--and be sure to 
shop before  December 10, 2000, to enjoy free  shipping on your order of $100 
or more (certain restrictions apply).  Thanks for helping make Amazon.com a 
great place to shop. 

Happy  anniversary,
