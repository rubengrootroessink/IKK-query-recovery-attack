ELECTION INTEGRITY UPDATE

Keep up the fight!
The walls are closing in on Vice President Al Gore. Both
the U.S. Supreme Court and the Leon County Circuit
Court in Florida ruled against Al Gore in two separate legal
battles.  First, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Florida Supreme Court had no legal justification for
extending the deadline for manual recounts.  The full text
of the Supreme Court decision is posted on our website at
http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/A363.cfm

The second blow to Gore came when Leon County Circuit
Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls ruled against his plea to
further extend the manual recounts.

Here's what Judge Sauls had to say:

"In order to contest election results . . . the plaintiff
must show that but for the irregularity or inaccuracy claim,
the result of the election would have been different and he
or she would have been the winner," said Sauls. "In this
case, there is no credible statistical evidence ...that the
results of the statewide election in in the state of Florida
would be different from the results certified by the election
canvassing board."

In the aftermath of these latest decisions, Mr. Gore has two
choices: drag on the fight to overturn the election in a
vain attempt to  discredit George W. Bush's legitimacy as
President-elect -- or, for the good of the people, concede.


As you know, Election Integrity is collecting online letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede.  Over 220,000 Americans
have signed in less than a week.   If you haven't already --
please go to our site and do it now.

We are so close to the end of this mess.  Let's keep up the
pressure.  PLEASE forward this message to your friends and
family and ask them to urge Al Gore to do the right thing
for our country -- CONCEDE.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
