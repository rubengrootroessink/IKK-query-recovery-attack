??TravelTips

European Travel Tip
?

When travelling to the U.K. with your hair dryer, electric shaver,  etc., 
don't forget to buy an adapter to fit in the U.K. sockets  before you leave 
home - or at latest in the airport upon arrival.  You are unlikely to find 
these adapters commonly available anywhere  else in the U.K. Adapters are 
available in all electrical shops,  but these are for U.K. appliances to fit 
non U.K. sockets, i.e.,  for when U.K. citizens are travelling outside of the 
U.K. Don't  forget that U.K. voltage is 240 volts - it will fry your 110 
volt  appliance without the correct transforming adapter. -Old Mill Private  
Hotel
