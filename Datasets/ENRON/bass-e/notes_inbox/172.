 Latest NFL Player News 

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/02/00 
 Batch should be able to play next weekend against Green Bay, despite leaving 
Thursday's game against Minnesota.   "He didn't reinjure his ribs or 
anything," team doctor David Collon said. "It was too sore for him to feel he 
could play effectively, so we just gave up after the first two series."   
Batch received numbing injections to ease pain in his ribs. Collon said no 
X-rays were necessary.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/02/00 
 Robinson was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Saturday, three 
days after he was admitted for treatment of back spasms.   Robinson's status 
for Sunday night's game against Green Bay at Soldier Field was downgraded 
from questionable to doubtful. Marty Booker might start in his place, with 
Dez White also seeing increased playing time.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00 
 Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time 
to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put 
him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to 
go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain 
on the active roster until Sunday.   "I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field 
goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals," Wilkins 
said. "It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no 
tweaks."     

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Smith will start at RB at Buffalo this week. He may be a risky start, 
because hamstring injuries sometimes seem to flare up quickly again.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Fiedler will start Sunday at Buffalo. He was sidelined by a pinched nerve in 
his neck on the first play against the New York Jets on Nov. 19. He returned 
to practice Wednesday.   "Jay looked good today, as he has all week, so he'll 
start," coach Dave Wannstedt said following Friday's workout.    

 Dedric Ward , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Ward caught six passes for 93 yards last week against the Bears. His numbers 
were likely helped due to the loss of rookie Laveranues Coles to an injury. 
Look for Ward to see some passes come his way this week against the Colts, as 
Coles will miss his second consecutive game.  Fantasy owners in deeper 
leagues may want to consider starting Ward this week.    

 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Johnson is listed as probable on the injury report with sore ribs, but he 
will still start this week's game against the Dolphins. He was knocked out of 
last week's game at Tampa Bay, but threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns 
before exiting. Don't expect big numbers from Johnson this week against 
Miami, whose defense ranks seventh in the league against the pass.     

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Cunningham did not practice on Thursday because of a groin strain. His 
status for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers is uncertain.  The Cowboys 
plan to use third string quarterback Anthony Wright to back up Troy Aikman if 
Cunningham isn't ready to play. At this point in the season, no Dallas 
quarterbacks should be considered for your starting lineup.    

 Panthers , DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Not that the Panthers have been a stellar defense for Fantasy owners this 
season, but this week may be a bad time to start Carolina.  The Panthers will 
face a Rams offense that will be pumped up and edgy with the return of QB 
Kurt Warner.  Carolina may get a few interceptions off a rusty Warner but 
look for them to struggle to score Fantasy points against the Rams.  It would 
be wise to use another defense for this week.    

 Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Gramatica to pile up Fantasy points this week as the Bucs score at 
will against the Cowboys.  He is currently seventh in the NFL in scoring.  
Barring injury, he should be one of the top picks among Fantasy kickers next 
year.    

 Buccaneers , DT TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for the Buccaneers to treat QB Troy Aikman like a tackling dummy this 
Sunday.  The Cowboys have failed to protect him against adequate pass rushes 
this season so don't expect them to do any better against the T.B. sack 
machine.  The Buccaneers will be in Aikman's face all day and will force him 
into some turnovers as well.  Fantasy owners that possess the Bucs' defense 
will see them help their team in a major way this week.    

 Ryan Longwell , K GB - Ramiro Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Longwell to have a big week against the Bears Sunday.  The Packers 
should have no problems gaining yards against the Bears but they may have 
trouble getting into the end zone, giving Longwell some kicking 
opportunities.  He has been successful when given the opportunity connecting 
on 24-of-28 FGs this season.  Look for him to score some points this week and 
be helpful, as far as Fantasy kickers go.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions' thinned secondary took another hit on Thursday as the team lost 
cornerback Bryant Westbrook for the remainder of the season to a torn left 
Achilles tendon. His loss will force Detroit to move nickel back Marquis 
Walker into the starting lineup.  The pass defense should be alright for the 
rest of the season though.  The pass rush has come alive recently forcing the 
QBs to rush their throws.  Detroit also has a favorable schedule with games 
against the Packers, Jets, and Bears.  Teams whose pass offense has struggle 
considerably this season.     

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Holcombe will start at fullback Sunday, but he will also get some carries at 
HB.  At this point in the Fantasy season he will be a good reserve back to 
have.  Just in case the Rams decide to rest Marshall Faulk in the upcoming 
weeks.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 So far so good for Wilkins and the Rams.  The kicker went through an intense 
kicking workout Thursday without experiencing any pain in his leg.  If he 
continues to kick without experiencing the slightest twinge he will play 
Sunday at Carolina.  Wilkins could be extremely helpful to Fantasy Owners in 
the last few weeks.  The Rams will get QB Kurt Warner back Sunday and face 
the Panthers and Vikings in their next two games.  Look for the offense to 
explode once again and give Wilkins a lot of opportunities to score points.   
 

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Moore's condition has improved and he has been upgraded to probable for 
Sunday's game against the Broncos.  Moore suffered a stinger against the Rams 
last Sunday and his neck and shoulder have been sore all week.  Give Moore a 
start this Sunday.  He has been an adequate replacement for RB Ricky Williams 
and has been a nice fit behind the Saints' offensive line.      

 Jake Reed , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Reed will practice Friday for the first time since breaking his leg.  He put 
up dismal Fantasy numbers before he injured his leg.  He could be back in 
action before the regular season ends but don't count on him helping out your 
Fantasy team.    

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Stecker the Bucs' primary kickoff returner sat out of practice Thursday and 
is not expected to play Sunday.  Tampa has activated WR Frank Murphy from its 
practice squad with intentions of having him handle the kicks.  If returners 
are valuable in your Fantasy league it would be wise for you to pick up a 
healthy return man.    

 Macey Brooks , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Brooks missed practice Thursday due to a lower back strain and is 
questionable for Sunday's game against the Packers.  If Brooks doesn't play 
the Bears will only have four healthy receivers.  This could mean a healthy 
diet of running plays.  It would be wise for Fantasy owners to utilize 
Chicago RBs James Allen and Marlon Barnes considering the health of the Bears 
receivers and Green Bay's recent struggles with its run defense.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/01/00 
 Robinson was hospitalized for back spasms Wednesday night and still remained 
in the hospital Thursday night.  He is also suffering from a lower back 
sprain and is not expected to play against the Packers Sunday.  Marty Booker 
and rookie Dez White will alternate in Robinson's spot.  Eddie Kennison will 
probably be used as the primary receiver.  It would be wise to stay away from 
Robinson and the rest of the Chicago passing team this week.    

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Stewart had a mediocre Fantasy game Thursday carrying 15 times for 67 yards 
and a touchdown.  Look for Stewart to have a better game against the Packers 
next week.  The Packers defensive line is thin without DT Santana Dotson. 
They allowed Carolina rookie Brad Hoover to romp through their front for 117 
yards Monday.     

 Stoney Case , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Case entered Thursday night's game for Detroit, replacing starter Charlie 
Batch who left after re-aggravating a rib injury. Playing for the injured 
Batch, Case completed 23-of-33 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception, and also ran six times for 62 yards. Case might not be a 
bad acquisition at this point of the season. If Batch can't play next week it 
would be best to plug in his backup. Batch may be the better winner, but 
Case's running ability makes him the better Fantasy QB.    

 Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 The rookie wideout put up the best numbers in a game laced with talented 
receivers.  He caught eight passes for 106 yards and a late touchdown.  Don't 
rush out and try to acquire Foster though.  His numbers were probably more a 
product of his chemistry with fellow second-stringer, QB Stoney Case, who 
filled in for the injured Charlie Batch.  Foster seemed to be Case's first 
throwing option.  When Batch returns Foster will probably be the third option 
again.    

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Culpepper had a boring Fantasy performance against the Lions Thursday.  He 
threw a touchdown and two interceptions while completing 19-of-32 passes for 
160 yards.  Expect bigger and better numbers for Culpepper when he faces the 
Rams next week in what will probably the biggest offensive explosion of the 
season.      

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Carter caught seven passes for 45 yards Thursday, including a four-yard 
second quarter touchdown for his 1,000th career  catch.  It was a milestone 
night for Carter but a forgettable one for Fantasy owners.  His numbers 
weren't too spectacular.  Look for him to put up better numbers against the 
Rams and their generous defense next week.    

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions managed to put the clamps on the star wideout Thursday.  He was 
held to 26 yards on three catches.  Don't worry Fantasy owners.  If your team 
is still in the playoff hunt Moss will make up for his performance next week 
against the Rams.  He is just too talented to be shut down in consecutive 
games.      

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 Smith ran for two touchdowns and 117 yards on 17 carries Thursday night, 
including a 43-yard fourth-quarter TD run that sealed the game for 
Minnesota.  If you have Smith on your Fantasy team he may very well seal a 
Fantasy championship for your team.  He is without a doubt the hottest 
Fantasy back right now.    

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.
