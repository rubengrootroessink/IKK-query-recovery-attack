Another storm pounds Telluride!

Short of hand-counting each snowflake that has fallen in Telluride, resort 
officials have projected that nearly 4 feet of snow has blanked the area in 
the past three weeks. 9 inches of fresh snow fell overnight to the 
overwhelming joy of town residents. Resort officials are reporting a 29-inch 
base on the mountain, with more than a week to go before the ski area opens 
to skiers and snowboarders.

"Gearing up for one of the resort's best openings in recent history ranks up 
there, as far as current events, with finding out who our next Presidnet will 
be," said Steve Swenson, vice president of sales, marketing and air service 
for the Telluride Ski & Golf Company.
