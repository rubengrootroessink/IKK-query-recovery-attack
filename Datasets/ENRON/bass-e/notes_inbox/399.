I definitely think trips on occasional plays will work.  Draw up some.  Try 
and make everything on one sheet so we can print it out and just take one 
piece of paper out there.  I will also draw up some and put it on whatever 
sheet you send me.

Subject: Trips

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.


What do you think?
