=09
=09 BROWN:  According to the Texas sports information office, the Hex Rally=
 will=20
be held Monday, Nov. 20, at 9 p.m. on the university's main mall in front o=
f=20
the UT Tower. For years, the Texas-Texas A=02? game featured bonfires at bo=
th=20
schools. But the environmentalists won out in Austin, causing the end to th=
e=20
bonfire for UT students. In place of the traditional bonfire, Texas turned=
=20
instead to an old story to start a new tradition. In 1941, Texas had not=20
beaten Texas A=02?at Kyle Field since 1923. A group of students turned to a=
n=20
Austin fortune teller named Mrs. August Hipple, who gave them the=20
prescription for victory. "Burn red candles," she said. The burning of the=
=20
candles, she thought, would show the great support for the team. Texas won,=
=20
23-0, and the red candle legend was born. The candle burning lay dormant=20
until 1950, when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU=20
game, and the Longhorns upset No. 1 SMU, 23-20. It was back in the boxes fo=
r=20
the candles after that until 1953, when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was=
=20
unbeaten and seeking its first-ever SWC title. Texas blocked an extra point=
=20
after the first score and won, 21-20. "The red candles are the most potent=
=20
whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked," wrote Tim=
e=20
magazine after the upset. In 1963, Texas was driving for its first unbeaten=
=20
season in modern history, and the possibility of a national championship as=
=20
it hosted Baylor. For three of the previous four years, UT had been in the=
=20
same position - on the verge of a perfect year - only to be upset. Out came=
=20
the red candles one more time, and UT won, 7-0. Bonfires ended in Austin in=

the late 1970s and seeking a new tradition, the "hex rallies" were started =

=09Chris Simms =20
=09
=09Q: So far this season, Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that we=
re=20
returned for touchdowns (if you count the return on the failed two-point=20
conversion attempt last week in Kansas). Can you help explain what Chris is=
=20
doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem? Also, has Chris set a=
=20
school record in this statistic? I enjoy the newsletter.=20
=09?? Jeff Cookston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking =
onto=20
his intended receiver too early in his drop back. He will look away from hi=
s=20
intended receiver
=09
=09but only for a split second. He needs to look off the defense better, an=
d he=20
also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage. He=
=20
suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre. He sees a receiver in=
=20
double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle=
.=20
Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and=
=20
returned for a TD against Kansas. He said he should have thrown it away. He=
=20
said he's learning. He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas =
is=20
at an all-time high. So that's good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up=
=20
getting the start against Texas A&M.=20

=09
=09 Q: Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle. To=
 his=20
credit, he maintained that two QBs were better than one. At this stage and=
=20
based on Chris Simms' recent games, it would seem to me that Brown was=20
correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five=
=20
games in a row. Also, Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simm=
s=20
motivated. What do you think?=20
=09?? Charley Davis, Southlake, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the rotation is now paying off. But I still stand by my=
=20
belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in t=
he=20
year. Mack Brown said the rotation didn't work as well as it could have=20
because this year's team lacked senior leadership. At North Carolina, Brown=
=20
said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older. Anyway, there's =
no=20
doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year. A=

Simms is definitely still happy at Texas. No chance of him transferring.=20

=09 Q: Which bowl do you see UT ending up in? I know that the second-place =

=09?? Mike Thakur=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, there'=
s a=20
chance both teams will get into the BCS. Nebraska would then be the likely=

choice for the Cotton Bowl, and the Texas-Texas A=02?winner would be the li=
kely=20
choice for the Holiday Bowl, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. But=20
there are rumblings that Nebraska isn't excited about the Cotton Bowl and=
=20
would rather go to the Holiday Bowl. That could send the UT-A=02?winner to =
the=20
Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insight.com Bowl =
in=20
Phoenix, Ariz. If Oklahoma beats Kansas State, the Wildcats would have thre=
e=20
losses, including one to Texas A&M. That means the Wildcats would probably=

drop to the Insight.com Bowl. And the winner of the UT-A=02?game would go t=
o=20
either the Holiday or the Cotton, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. T=

out for the game; and 3) A&M's coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma i=
n=20
the biggest game of the year on a national stage. It will be hard to recove=

from that. It looks as if Texas has everything going for it. I believe if=

A=02?would have beaten Oklahoma, there is not any way Texas beats A=02?when=
 the Big=20
12 south crown is on the line.=20
=09 ?? Justin S. Schwertner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I don't see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahom=
a=20
loss. They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence fro=
m=20
that game. The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss (or diminished=
=20
ability) of Glenn, Ferguson and Davis. Glenn, the team's sack leader and a=
=20
spirited leader at linebacker, is out for sure with a knee injury that will=
=20
require surgery. If Ferguson, one of the top receivers in the Big 12, and=
=20
Davis, a top cornerback for the Aggies, indeed cannot play, those are big=
=20
hurdles to overcome for A&M. Playing in Austin helps Texas. But this game=

will probably come down to who runs the ball best. Look for this to be a=20

lf.=20
Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half. He did have a=20
35-yard reverse for a touchdown (in the second half) for his first rushing =
TD=20
as a Longhorn. But perhaps the
=09
=09 most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD=
=20
receptions this season have averaged 47.6 yards. Five of those TD catches=
=20
came when Texas was behind or tied. The other two came when UT was holding=
=20
narrow three-point and seven-point leads and provided oomph on the way to=
=20
victories. He may end up on some All-Big 12 second teams because Kansas=20

season. Williams will certainly land on any all-newcomer teams, however.=20
Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division I-A in receiving=

=09 Q: I hate to complain about anything after such a good win, but what's =
the=20
story behind our soft defense on opening drives? It seems that it takes a=
