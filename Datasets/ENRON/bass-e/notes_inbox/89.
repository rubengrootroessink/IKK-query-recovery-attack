Brown going up against Oregon's Mike Bellotti.=20
=09
=09 You may not know much about Bellotti, but know this about his tenure at=
=20
Oregon - in six years, he has a 48-22 record, and those 48 wins are more th=
an=20
any other Pac-10 school during that time period. And over the last four=20

vs. Wisconsin and 23-13 at Oregon State). =20
=09
=09 Brown certainly is impressed by Bellotti's success at Oregon.=20
=09
=09 "Mike Bellotti is a personal friend," Brown said in a news release from=
 UT's=20
sports information office. "He took over for Rich Brooks at Oregon a number=
=20
of years ago when they were representing the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl for th=
e=20
first time in a long time. He has done a great job building on that success=
=20
each of his years as head coach. It will be fun to be around him and his te=

=09
=09 Added Holiday Bowl president Jim Philion: "Coach Bellotti has built the=

=09 ?? Todd Davis=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the=
=20
Holiday Bowl. I know that sounds like, "Well, of course, that's what they=
=20
would say." But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the=20
Kansas game by saying if UT won out, they would go to the Holiday Bowl, a=
=20
fun, sunny destination against a top 10 team. Aside from the beach balls an=
d=20
surfing, the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid=20
mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game. For=20
instance, Chris Simms was paid $1,500 by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to=
=20
the Cotton Bowl last year. So he'll really clean up this year. Not that he=
=20
needs it. But you get the picture. It's a way for some of the players to ma=
ke=20
a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the=
=20
mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an=
d=20
pocket the rest. The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on=20
their own. The team will not charter a flight. (All players have to be=20
checked into the team hotel in San Diego by 10 p.m. on Dec. 22). Mack Brown=
=20
wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would w=
in=20
the Big 12 South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top=
=20
10 team. And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team=
.=20
Last year, Texas and its fans couldn't seem to get fired up for an unranked=

=09
=09Q: How high do you think Casey Hampton will go in the NFL draft?  I woul=
d=20
think he's a cinch first rounder. Could he go in the top five?   ??=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Hampton could go in the first or second round. The second round=
=20
might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive=20
linemen coming out this year. But Hampton has been really watching his weig=
ht=20
and trying to improve his speed. He promised me that scouts at the NFL=20
combine will be surprised when=20
=09
=09they see him work out. Hampton is a great story. The guy just works his =
tail=20
off and knows that his height (slightly more than 6-1) will probably play=
=20
against him. So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area.=
=20
But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNews.co=
m=20
ran before the Texas A=02?game, "The film don't lie. If you can show me whe=

=09
=09 Q: Texas' quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thi=
ng =20
manufactured by the ill-fated rotation scheme. Now, however, the  quarterba=
ck=20
controversy is real. Texas now has two genuine starting  quarterbacks. Chri=
s=20
Simms is no longer the next boy wonder. He  has arrived. Does ANYONE in the=
=20
nation have a better quarterback  tandem than Texas? How in the world is Ma=
ck=20
Brown going to deal with this?  If they keep the simplified offensive schem=
e=20
next year, do you think the  QB rotation could resurface and actually work?=
 =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penn=
y of=20
his salary because of the quarterback situation. And he'll earn every penny=
=20
again next year. Unless unforseen circumstances, such as injuries, dictate=
=20
otherwise, I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next=20
year. And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms=
=20
next year. He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite, just as=
=20
Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton. If Simms starts t=
he=20
bowl game, and Texas plays well and wins, Simms will have done nothing to=
=20
lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter.=
=20
If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com=
e=20
in and relieve him, then we are back to square one, with both guys battling=
=20
it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter. Texas coaches have=
=20
said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this=
=20
season because of his experience. So we'll see if their stance has changed.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: The 70-yard pump-and-go TD play from Chris Simms  to B.J. Johnson is=
 both=20
a validation of Simms' abilities AND an indictment  of the quarterback=20
rotation. Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played  every=20
offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the=20
defensive  player responsible. To my mind, that is a strong argument agains=
t=20
any kind of QB rotation  scheme. But, on the other hand, how can one NOT wa=
nt=20
to play both of these  immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible?=
=20
Can we get a rule change to allow  two footballs on the field at once (ha=
=20
ha)?   ??=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota=
tion=20
next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris=
h=20
whenever he is on the field. But his comments all season have directly and=
=20
indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence=20
didn't come around until he was taking all the snaps. So I don't know if th=
e=20
coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his=20
confidence.=20

=09[IMAGE] Mack Brown =20
=09
=09Q: What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach? I noticed earl=
ier=20
in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns,=
=20
which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Brown's ability to fire up the tea=
m,=20
assuming that Texas has more talented players. I think that he has proven=
=20
that he can win big games, but he has also had some surprising slipups. Bro=
wn=20
is unquestionably a great recruiter, but do you question his leadership=20
ability on gameday? =20
=09 ?? Andrew Wootton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Up until the Texas Tech game, Mack Brown was saying things like=
 "We=20
could lose any game we play. I just don't know which team is going to show=
=20
up. We could go 6-5 or 9-2." Those kinds of=20
=09
=09comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the=
=20
Longhorns. Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any=
=20
coach I've been around. So when he was saying things like that, it made you=
=20
wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity. Clearly, this ye=
ar=20
was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense. The defens=
e=20
was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge. But the offense really=20
struggled to find an identity. Part of that was the quarterback rotation.=
=20
Part of it was having young receivers, and part of it was having a bunch of=
=20
guys with low-key personalities (i.e. Hodges Mitchell, Leonard Davis, Antwa=
n=20
Kirk-Hughes, Derrick Dockery, Mike Williams etc.). Mack Brown even said it=
=20
was the quietest bunch of offensive players he'd been around. Once Mack Bro=
wn=20
and Co. decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t=
he=20
starter, Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as=
=20
anything else.=20
=09
=09I think Mack Brown is a great coach. Let me say that again. He is a grea=
t=20
coach. I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi=
p=20
on the field. The more he rotated the QBs, the less chance the offense had =
to=20
develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit=
h=20
learning their responsibilities in four-wide as well as trying to adjust to=
=20
having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle. The offensive linemen, earl=
y=20
on, also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi=
m.=20
I'm sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly=
=20
than it did. Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he=20
played Simms more in the Stanford game - an outing in which Applewhite real=
ly=20
struggled until the fourth quarter. Against Oklahoma, the Sooners executed=
=20
flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldn't get up from. It=
=20
was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo=
n=20
in Austin, according to many.=20
=09
=09But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati=
ng=20
out of his hand any time he wants. All he has to do is tune out the negativ=
e=20
comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say,=
=20
"We are doing the best we can. We learn. We make mistakes. We're going to=
=20
keep trying harder." Those are comments no negative fan can argue with.=20
Instead, Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint=20
everything about this season. Each press conference was filled with a comme=
nt=20
about how the media and fans had beat up this year's team. It was=20
contentious. Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times.=20
Paterno hates the media, rarely gives out interviews, etc. So if Mack Brown=
=20
is following in Paterno's footsteps on that issue, it would be a shame.=20
Paterno doesn't have one-quillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow=
n.=20
=09
=09Brown got tough questions during his radio call-in show this season. Som=
e=20
weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others. But a guy like Brown=
=20
is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off=
=20
of his back, use that self-deprecating laugh of his and then take his=20
frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi=
s=20
team into a juggernaut. Mack Brown should know his team's personality going=
=20
into next year because so many players will be back. And he'll have this ye=
ar=20
as a blueprint of how not to do things, in many instances. And he's where h=
e=20
wants to be - at a major college football power and always being in the=20
position of favorite. At North Carolina, as well as he recruited and coache=
d,=20
Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood. At Texa=
s,=20
he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that=
=20
Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big 12. Now, Oklahoma has come=
=20
charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without=20
excuses. If you notice, Stoops didn't gripe about having to play the Big 12=
=20
title game and possibly ruin his team's national title chances. He didn't=
=20
gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in=
=20
Kansas City. He has a tough attitude, and his team has adopted his attitude=
.=20
Brown has a tough attitude, too. And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and=
=20
all of next season will be the truest test of Brown's coaching and dealing=
=20
with expectations. Brown said, fairly and accurately, that Texas couldn't b=
e=20
expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadn't=
=20
finished a season in the top 10 since 1983. "How do you jump to No. 1 witho=
ut=20
having first been in the top 10?" Brown said before the season. Does this=
=20
kind of talk trickle into the ears of players? I don't know. Most of the=20
Longhorns before the season (Applewhite and Hampton included) felt like Tex=
as=20
could win the national title. That's one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam=
e=20
back to Texas this season. When UT lost to Stanford, Brown emerged from an=
=20
emotionally blasted locker room and said, "I didn't think this was a nation=
al=20
title team." He went on to say the team was too young. Are these excuses fo=
r=20
his team? If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl, the Longhorns will hav=
e=20
their top 10 finish and will once again be ranked in the top 10 heading int=
o=20
next season.=20
=09
=09On defense, the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca=
sey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on. But Marcus Tubbs, Adam Doiron a=
nd=20
Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position. Cory=20
Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better, and there is a wealth of=
=20
talent in the seven guys behind them. On offense, the big question mark is =
at=20
running back, where Hodges Mitchell is moving on. He's a guy some Texas fan=
s=20
still think is worthless. But let me tell you, he isn't. He's got guts and=
=20
gave everything he had. It may take some time to see another back who can=
=20
catch and run the way he does. UT will have several backs to pick from,=20
including freshman-to-be Cedric Benson. The rest of the team is proven and=
=20
will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end.=20
=09
=09I don't see any excuses for this team next year. National championship t=
alk=20
will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda. Here's hoping that Mac=
k=20
Brown doesn't let the nitpickers bog him down. And I include myself in that=
=20
group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact=
s=20
- positive or negative. Here's to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time=20
getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl=
e=20
negative angles in a newspaper story. Here's to hoping that he'll take on=
=20
critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily=20
basis. Places like Texas, Alabama and Ohio State have fans who are seemingl=
y=20
never satisfied. Until Brown wins a national championship, UT fans will=20
second-guess and doubt and wonder why something else wasn't tried. That cou=
ld=20
continue even if he wins a national title. But that's sports. It's worse no=
w=20
because there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the Internet=
=20
and all-day talk radio. Mack Brown lives under a microscope. Fans think the=

=09 ?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, gauging by how some of the BCS polls had Florida State hi=
gher=20
than Oklahoma, I think it's fair to say that strength of schedule is a=20
concern for Texas next year. I think Texas has to win all its games next=20
season to make sure that it is not in the position of Miami, which beat=20
Florida State but is not in the national championship picture. If Texas goe=

10-1 next season, the Longhorns could very well not be in control of their=
