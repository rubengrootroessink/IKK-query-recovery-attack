It Costs So Little, And It Means So Much

As you are aware, if the voting results in
Florida stand as they are now, George W.
Bush will be our next President. This will
have catastrophic results in our vital,
indispensable, entertainment industry.

Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin, among many
others have sworn to leave the country if George
W. Bush is elected President.

And this is where YOU can help. We need
volunteers to help pack and load moving vans.
We also need volunteers to provide airfare for
these irreplaceable national treasures so they
can relocate before they can change their minds.

For the cost of a small SUV you can sponsor
one of these celebrities and their unfortunate
relocation. You will know that your efforts are
helping when you receive postcards, letters and
pictures from your chosen "refugee" as they
learn to become a useful citizen in the
third world country of their choosing.

You will help, won't you? It costs so little,
but it means so much.

Call 1-800-deport-a-lib. Operators are standing by.
Major credit cards are accepted.
