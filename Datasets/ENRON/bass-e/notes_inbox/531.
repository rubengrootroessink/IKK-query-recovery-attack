ADD TO THE PLAYOFF FUN

Why leave some teams on the sideline come playoff time? The
league's commissioner can schedule "consolation" matchups
during the playoff tournament. In the Front Office, go to
Schedule, Matchups and choose the week(s) that your
playoffs take place. Under "Other Games," you can set any
matchups you want. If there are two teams that split the
regular season series, here's a great way to settle the
score. Of course, these matchups won't count toward your
league's "official" championship, but they prolong the
season, and the fun, for those teams that came up short.


STAY ON TOP OF ALL PLAYER INJURY INFO

As the season winds down and your team battles for playoff
positioning, it's more important than ever to have the
latest injury news. Your league's web site contains all the
injury information you need to make informed lineup
decisions. For a snapshot view of all recent player
injuries and status, go to Scouting Reports, Injuries. Go
to Scouting Reports, Player Updates for continually updated
news and fantasy analysis for all NFL players. To see the
most recent updates for the players on your team, go to
Teams, Player News. Also, monitor our News, NFL News page
for weekly Q&A sessions and "Injury Roundup" columns from
Steve Cohen, CBS SportsLine's pro football injury guru.


MILLER LITE

The tab for SportsLine's FREE Fantasy Football is being
picked up by Miller Lite, our favorite beer around here.
Check them out offline at your local bar or online with us.
Grab a Miller Lite. It's Miller Time!

FOLLOW THE LEADERS

Using the Statistics, Leaders link, you can find out the
leading players in any statistical category. Just choose a
statistic in the listbox above the report, click GO, and
the current leaders will be displayed. It's a great way to
find the best free agent, or trade possibility, if you need
to fill a late-season need or replace one of your injured
starters.


PLANTERS

Football Season is Planters Season. Don't get left on the
sidelines. Planters brings you TWO ways to win! Click here:

COMPLETE SUNDAY NFL COVERAGE

You never have to leave your league's web site for complete
coverage during Sunday's games. If you can manage to peel
yourself away from Live Scoring, check Scouting Reports,
Player Updates for breaking player news as it happens. Be
sure to monitor our News, NFL News page for gameday fantasy
tips, and throughout the week as our staff is committed to
providing the most complete fantasy and NFL news coverage
on the web.


THE TOP SCORERS, BY POSITION

Along with the leaders in any statistical category, you can
also find the leaders at each position. Go to Statistics,
Player Scoring to see how many fantasy points your players
have scored each week. Use the second listbox above the
report to view week-by-week fantasy scores for all players
at a specific position. It's yet another great way to scout
players for that key late-season trade or free agent
pickup.
