Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five 
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle 
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a 
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back 
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to 
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be 
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end 
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open. 

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before 
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or 
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the 
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback 
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is 
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a 
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the 
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of 
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds. 
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the 
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense 
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on 
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the 
"twins" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving 
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in 
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block 


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver 
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick 
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield 
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an 
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As 
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into 
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most 
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can 
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never 
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of 
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down 
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to 
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if 
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he 
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a 
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field 
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback. 
Don't pitch the ball to the other team. 

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage 
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the 
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle 
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the 
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If 
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should 
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play 
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB 
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs 
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is 
Crucial.
