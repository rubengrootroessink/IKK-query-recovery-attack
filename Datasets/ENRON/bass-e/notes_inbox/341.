As sure as each hour brings a new court decision =01( as sure cranberry sal=
es
peak in November =01( Thanksgiving surprise fares appear. We=01,re sending =
out
this special edition e-mail to give you a jump on these new deals. Plus,
in (festive) light of our new, lower Turkey Day fares and the short
workweek, we decided to release our Hot Deals By E-mail today and on
Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to
travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from
Uncle Ed=01,s snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of =
a
two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving
Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares
are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to
1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also
offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun,
Grand Cayman, Montego Bay and St. Maarten with discounts reaching 60
percent for travel through June 15, 2001. If you=01,re going to be travelin=
g
and unable to check your e-mail, why not ask a family member at your
destination to sign up for a free Hot Deals subscription, so you can check
the latest-breaking deals from their computers? Just tell them Tom Parsons
will be talking turkey on low-fare travel.

THANKSGIVING FARES $64 TO $189 RT THROUGHOUT 48 STATES.
With airfares as low as $64 roundtrip, Thanksgiving travel is within the
reach of almost everyone. If you=01,re having the traditional family dinner
at home, here=01,s your opportunity to bring in a few more family members o=
r
friends to make the day more memorable. Or, surprise your family with a
short (and sweet) visit. In some cases, you can deliver yourself for
little more than what an FTD holiday bouquet would cost. A quick trip can
also provide a chance for some great Friday shopping. Head to New York
City for Macy=01,s Thanksgiving Day Parade and check out the festive store
windows. Visit the gigantic Mall of America in Minneapolis, Rodeo Drive in
Beverly Hills or the Dallas Galleria. To qualify for these super low
fares, you must depart on Thanksgiving Day and be on a return flight no
later than midnight Friday, November 25. One other important plus with
this special is that we can waive the standard $40 roundtrip fuel
surcharge. How cheap are these two-day stay fares? How about Dallas/Fort
Worth to San Diego or Los Angeles for $135 roundtrip? You can fly from
Chicago to New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Atlanta for
$103 roundtrip. Fly from San Francisco to Minneapolis, Oklahoma City or
San Antonio for $151 roundtrip. Denver to Dallas/Fort Worth, Kansas City
