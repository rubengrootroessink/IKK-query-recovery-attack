 Latest NFL Player News 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.
