FIVE-DAY SUPER SALE: $158 RT COAST-TO-COAST
On Tuesday of this week, our coast-to coast airfares for $158 roundtrip
expired. Due to overwhelming demand, we have been able to convince our
suppliers to renew these special fares from select U.S. cities. This new
contract was signed and sealed at 11:00 a.m., this morning.
This sale will now be available for travel through February 15, 2001 and
tickets must be purchased by December 11, 2000. These special fares will
not be available to/from Florida from December 18, 2000 through January 4,
2001, seats are completely sold out. The good news is that if you can fly
to Florida between January 5 and February 15, 2001, we have many airfares
ranging between $110 and $128 roundtrip. Airfares to/from California,
Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Utah and New Mexico to/from over 20
eastern U.S. cities range between $158 to $198 roundtrip.

We worked hard to extend this sale and our travel clubs will remain open
Thursday through Monday, including this weekend until 11:00 p.m. (CST).
Don't miss out on what could be the last super sale of 2000. For more
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=10067898.
