Hi Folks,

Lots of news so let's jump right  into it.

Quarterbacks in the  News:
?
QB  Rob Johnson (Buf) is listed as questionable, but he is not expected to 
play. QB  Doug Flutie will start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update? Buffalo  QBs.? This could get ugly.? Johnson said he 
felt that  anonymous negative comments made in the Sports Illustrated article 
were made by  Flutie.? It's still my contention that Flutie is playing for?a  
starting job from here on out.? If he plays well Sunday and the Bills win,  
Johnson had better be for finding a baseball cap he's comfortable with.?  

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is out with a bad shoulder. Jim Miller  starts?in his 
absence.
?
QB Troy Aikman (Dal) will sit with his sore back.  Randall Cunningham will 
take over the reins this week.

QB Brian Griese  (Den) was arrested for driving under the influence. This is 
not expected to  cause any problems for the remainder of this season.

QB Mark Brunell  (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with  his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his  sore neck. Look for 
the same this week.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) practiced with  the second team. He will likely back up Jim 
Harbaugh for the remainder of the  season.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not expected to play this week. Jon Kitna  returns to 
the starting job.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out with a broken  pinkie. Trent Green starts in his 
absence.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)  practiced Thursday and is expected to start.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) will  miss at least this week's game. He could be out 
from 2-4 weeks. Jeff George gets  the start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Brad Johnson (Was)  is looking like his knee injury 
could be more serious than originally  thought. He has a?"significant" (grade 
2) tear of his MCL in his left knee  that is close to being a complete tear 
which is a grade 3.? This will get  very interesting if Jeff George plays  
well.

will be very limited this weekend  if he plays at all.

good for Sunday.?

season.
