 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  "Never 
Nervous" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams says he is ready to play in Thursday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left knee.  He 
injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against Phoenix.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped "The Man of Steel" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.    

 Jason Williams , G SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams dazzled the Sacramento crowd and his opposition Wednesday by 
dishing out 12 assists in his first game back from a league induced 
suspension.  He was suspended for the first five games of the season for 
failing to comply with his drug treatment plan.  Williams appeared to be in 
great shape and is ready to be a Fantasy star this year.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Jones played in Wednesday's game at Dallas after suffering a concussion on 
Monday.  He scored five points and had three assists.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  No timetable on his return has been reported.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Gill left Wednesday night's game against the Wizards in the first half after 
feeling some pain in his knee. He has had a variey of injuries early in the 
season, including suffering a scratched cornea and dealing with back spasms. 
Despite the soreness in his knee, Gill doesn't expect to miss any court time, 
and should play in tonight's game against the Pistons.     

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Wallace fell awkwardly on his left leg after being fouled by Sixers' forward 
George Lynch in Wednesday night's game.  He sat out the rest of the night as 
a precaution, but expects to be in the lineup tonight when the Pistons face 
off against the Nets.     

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Herren, who is due to come off the injury list this weekend, will start at 
point guard against Philadelphia on Saturday.  He has been sidelined with an 
ankle injury, which has caused him to miss Boston's first four games.  

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play 
his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.
