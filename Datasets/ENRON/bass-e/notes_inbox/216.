 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Skinner was activated from the injured list by the Clippers today. He missed 
five games dating back to November 18 with a sprained right ankle. Skinner 
will need to rebound from a slow start to this season, as he is averaging 5.8 
points and 4.7 rebounds in 10 games thus far.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Barros was activated from the injured list for tonight's game against New 
Jersey. Unfortunately, the 11-year veteran probably won't have much Fantasy 
value this season, as he'll have a harder time getting playing time in 
Detroit than he did in Boston.  

 Don MacLean , F MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The NBA suspended MacLean for five games without pay today for violating the 
steroid policy of the league and the NBA Players' Association. He has been 
limited to just three games this season and was scheduled to miss at least a 
month after undergoing surgery on his right foot November 15. It's unlikely 
MacLean will garner any further Fantasy value this season after this recent 
development, especially considering he is the first player in league history 
to be suspended for steroid use.  

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Dickerson is expected to come off the injured list for Friday's game against 
Indiana or Sunday's matchup with San Antonio.  He has been sidelined for over 
a week with a sprained ankle.  Dickerson will be a little out of synch at 
first but look for him to pick up where he left off after a few games.    

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Walker is suffering from a sprained left ankle and is not expected to play 
in Wednesday's game against the Kings.  He was on crutches Sunday and Monday, 
but rode a stationary bike during Tuesday's practice.  The ankle could affect 
Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.  Although he has 
been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is only valuable in 
deeper Fantasy leagues.      

 Tariq Abdul-Wahad , G DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Although Raef LaFrentz will return to the starting lineup, Wahad will 
continue to come off the bench.  Wahad was removed from the starting lineup 
along with LaFrentz two games ago.  As has been the case for most of his 
career Abdul-Wahad has struggled with his shooting this season and hasn't 
been a productive Fantasy player, averaging 5.5 ppg this season.  

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 LaFrentz will be back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the 
last two games, his replacement Keon Clark will go back to the bench.  
Although LaFrentz hasn't played too well this season head coach Dan Issel has 
stated he made the original move to prevent singling out one player for the 
team's struggles.  Meaning he benched LaFrentz to appease Tariq Abdul-Wahad 
who was also removed as a starter.  LaFrentz may not play much better now 
that he is back in the starting team but he will still provide as much 
Fantasy production as most other centers.     

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Buckner has missed the team's last five games with a sprained right foot.  
He had an injection in his sprained right foot that will prevent him from 
participating in practices for at least 2-3 days.  This will keep him out of 
action for at least the next two games.  Hubert Davis will continue to start 
at shooting guard and Michael Finley will play small forward in his absence.  
When Buckner finally does return it will take awhile for him to get back into 
game form.     

 Etan Thomas , C DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Thomas has a cast on his right foot for a fractured bone under his right big 
toe.  He is expected to wear the cast for three weeks.  His condition will be 
re-evaluated at that time.  Monitor his situation for now.  He is a good 
rebounder and shot-blocker who may be able to help a Fantasy team in 
January.   

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Bryant signed with the Mavericks Tuesday for the pro-rated veteran minimum.  
He was released by Cleveland on November 15.  Forward Bill Curley was waived 
to make room for Bryant.  Bryant will get some playing time off the bench but 
won't be much help to a Fantasy team.    

 Keith Van Horn , F NJ - The Wave Updated 11/29/00 
 Van Horn has been cleared to do some "light running" by team doctors and 
expects to return to the Nets in about two weeks.  He broke his left leg 
during a preseason game against the Orlando Magic.  When Van Horn does 
return, Fantasy owners will certainly be scrambling to pick him up.  

 Jim McIlvaine , C NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 McIlvaine did not play in Tuesday's game against the Jazz due to an 
intestinal infection and won't accompany the team for Wednesday's game in 
Detroit.  His return is yet to be determined.  McIlvaine holds no Fantasy 
value.  

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Atkins is still suffering from a sprained ankle, which kept him out of 
practice on Tuesday.  Although he is listed as probable for Wednesday's game 
against the Nets, rookie Mateen Cleaves may start in Atkins' place.  Even if 
he doesn't play, Atkins isn't expected to miss any significant time due to 
the injury.    

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Person was activated from the injured list on Tuesday after missing 
Cleveland's last eight games with an elbow injury. Before the injury, Person 
was averaging 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. Person will likely split 
time with Trajan Langdon, which diminishes what little Fantasy value he may 
have had.     

 Cherokee Parks , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Parks has been traded once again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers. He 
was averaging 3.7 points and 3.1 rebounds as Jahidi White's backup in 
Washington.  Parks holds no Fantasy value.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Jermaine O'Neal , F IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/29/00 
 O'Neal was held out of the starting lineup because he was late for a team 
plane Monday.  He had started his team's first 12 games.  He still managed to 
post another double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.  
O'Neal should be back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden 
State.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Collier had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Tuesday and will be out 
4-to-6 weeks.  With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets 
will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Sabonis re-injured his left knee when he stepped on teammate Scottie 
Pippen's foot in the first quarter against Seattle on Tuesday night.  The 
extent of his latest injury is not known yet and Sabonis is listed as 
day-to-day.  He missed the first eight games of the season after arthroscopic 
surgery on the knee revealed torn cartilage.   Dale Davis will replace 
Sabonis in the starting lineup if he is unable to play.     

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  "If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him," said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.
