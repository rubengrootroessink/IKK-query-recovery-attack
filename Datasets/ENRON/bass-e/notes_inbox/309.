An estimated 25,000  people stood in a driving rainstorm in temperatures of=

35 degrees at 2:42 a.m.  on Nov. 18, 2000. They represented Aggies everywhe=

40 minute candlelight  memorial ceremony that marked the first anniversary =

In the center of the  Polo Field stood a two-tiered white platform surround=

by rows of maroon  chairs. The first level was lined with "pots," the=20
hardhats used by Aggies while  working on the Bonfire stack. The second lev=

consisted of 12 maroon and white  candles surrounding a black pipe in the=
=20
center that when lighted produced the  memorial flame. Seated around the=20
platform, in 12 separate groups, were the  families of the 12 Aggies who=20
died. Behind each set of seats stood a 5- to  6-foot wood pillar listing ea=

victim's name and their graduation year. =20

As the ceremony  commenced at exactly 2:42 a.m., lights on the polo fields=
=20
were turned off and  the memorial flame was lighted. As the roll call was=

After bagpipes played =01&Amazing Grace,"  the ceremony ended as these word=

Of special note, as  the crowd began to disperse, a band of determined Aggi=
