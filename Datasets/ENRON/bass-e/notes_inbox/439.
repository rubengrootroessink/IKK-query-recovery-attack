  Court Upholds Florida Vote Deadline
  The Associated Press
  Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2000; 1:04 p.m. EST

  TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that state
  officials may cut off the vote recount in the state's fiercely
  contested presidential election at 5 p.m. EST.

  Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or
  corrected totals after the deadline, and Secretary of State
  Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs "proper
  exercise of discretion."

  A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida: A Summary
  Tuesday, November 14, 2000

  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality
  to the election process in Florida.  They believe the American
  people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts
  and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks.

  The vote in Florida has been counted.  It has been recounted.
  Both times, Governor Bush has emerged the winner.  And there
  have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or
  the recount.  Confusion, yes.  Fraud, no.  Yet the Gore
  campaign refuses to accept the result.

  Rather than accept the result, the Gore campaign has demanded
  manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties.  In fact,
  the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic
  precincts in these counties to recount.

  Broward County
  Precinct 1F: 1308 votes for Gore, 62 for Bush;
  Precinct 6F: 1175 votes for Gore, 52 for Bush;
  Precinct 6C: 1071 votes for Gore, 19 for Bush

  This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more
  focused on selectivity than fairness.  Even still, Gore was only
  able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the
  three Gore-chosen counties in Democratic Broward County.  Based
  on this small change in votes, the Broward County canvassing board
  voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county.

  Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials
  to continue the manual count.  This is after they have talked for
  days about letting the local officials run the recounts.  And
  yesterday, the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that
  Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to
  certify its election returns by 5:00pm today.  Amazingly, the
  Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of
  the statute.  It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on
  Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics.

  In sum, the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any
  finality.  They refused to accept the first vote.  They refused
  to accept the recount.  They refused to accept the manual
  recounts in selective counties.

  That's why today Secretary James A. Baker offered the following
  common sense proposal to solve the impasse:

  Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount.  Vice President
  Gore has objected to today's 5:00pm deadline required by Florida
  law.  Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual
  recount up to today's 5:00pm deadline if Vice President Gore
  agrees.  This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive
  process to a reasonable conclusion.

  Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker

  In earlier statements, we have emphasized the importance of
  achieving some finality to the election process, not just here
  in Florida, but of course for the nation as a whole.  More and
  more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see
  uncertainty abroad. I believe that most observers, whether at
  home or abroad, are troubled by the prospect of seemingly
  endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the
  result he seeks.

  The vote in Florida was counted, and then it was recounted.
  Governor Bush was the winner of the vote.  He was the winner
  of the recount. There have been no allegations of vote fraud in
  either the count or in the recount.  No fraud---just confusion
  of some individuals.  Yet the Gore campaign refuses to accept
  the result.

  Statistics point to more than random error in Florida vote
  Jace Radke
  11/10/00

  At one in 49 million, the chances of hitting Megabucks on
  one spin are slim, but not as slim as the odds that Vice
  President Al Gore would make up as much ground as he has in
  the Florida recount, according to a UNLV study.

  Economics professor Tom Carroll began running statistical
  equations Thursday on the net gains both Gore, who gained
  more than 2,200 votes, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who
  added about 700 votes, have made in the recount. He found
  that the statistical chances for such large and different
  totals to occur as a result of random glitches was less
  than infinitesimal.

  "The probability of being struck by lightning is about one
  in a million," Carroll said. "The same person would have to
  be hit by lightning 30 times to compare with what we've seen
  in this recount."

  Gore might lose a second round: Media suppressed the Bush vote
  John R. Lott Jr.
  11/14/00

  With Florida's election results so close, charges of voter
  confusion and intimidation fill the air. Votes have been
  recounted and are being recounted yet again. Because of the
  closeness of the race, problems that have been ignored in the
  past are difficult to ignore now.

  So what has created this incredible closeness? The Gore campaign,
  along with the media, has focused on possible problems in Palm
  Beach county. Supposedly, had it not been for the 19,000 spoiled
  ballots where voters cast more than two votes for president and
  the 3,400 votes that Buchanan received, there would have been a
  Gore victory. But by now many have heard that the spoiled ballots
  are nothing new in Palm Beach, where 14,800 ballots suffered
  similar problems in the last presidential election. Heavily
  Republican Duval County apparently had over 25,000 similarly
  spoiled ballots.

  Buchanan's votes are actually not an anomaly. With 16,695
  registered members of the American Reform, Reform and Independent
  Parties, Palm Beach is a hotbed of Reform party activity. Indeed,
  it has the second highest total Reform and Independent party
  membership of any county in the state. Hillsborough County,
  which comes in third, lags behind with 11,258 members. Up to
  two-thirds of Buchanan's vote in Palm Beach can be explained
  simply by county differences in party registration.

  A more important explanation for the close results exists. By
  prematurely declaring Gore the winner shortly before polls had
  closed in Florida's conservative western Panhandle, the media
  ended up suppressing the Republican vote. Bush obtained over
  65 percent of the vote in the affected area. With only 329 votes
  separating the two candidates Friday morning, even a few hundred
  discouraged votes in addition to the 379,000 cast in Florida's
  western panhandle could have made a crucial difference.

  Many Partial, spoiled ballots
  Scott Fornek and Abdon M. Pallasch
  11/14/00

  Cook County--home of the notorious "butterfly" ballot--was more
  likely than any other Chicago area county to have voters who
  skipped the presidential contest on their ballots last week or
  mistakenly chose more than one candidate.

  City and suburban officials said 122,859 of the 1,987,954 people
  who cast ballots in the county either did not punch a choice in
  the top contest or spoiled their ballot for that race by punching
  more than one hole.

  In Chicago, the 72,934 ballots represented 7.1 percent of all
  ballots cast. In suburban Cook, the 49,925 ballots were 5.2 percent
  of the total.

  Comparable figures in the other five counties ranged from 0.4
  percent for McHenry to 2.5 percent for Will, according to a Chicago
  Sun-Times analysis of last week's vote.

  Election officials in Cook County conceded the numbers were higher
  than normal. But they could not provide an explanation for the
  discrepancy or a breakdown, so it was impossible to tell if the
  absence of votes was largely voluntary or a problem voters had
  with the ballots.
