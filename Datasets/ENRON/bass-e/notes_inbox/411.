**************************** November 16, 2000  ************************

Don=01,t worry about airfares going up. We=01,ll lock in a low fare for you=
 for
travel through August 15, 2001. This deal includes 90 cities and the
roundtrip fare is just $298 coast-to-coast. From California (home of a
million still uncounted absentee ballots) to Florida (where political
alligators wrestle for dominance), the country is at your disposal.

COAST-TO-COAST FOR $298 ROUNDTRIP--OR LESS.
It took us a few months to negotiate our new coast-to-coast fares because
we wanted the best deal possible. No recounts here=01*the deal is now signe=
d,
sealed and delivered. The airlines have given us five fare hikes this
year, as the majors try to cover higher fuel costs. Since saving money
fuels our engine, we sympathized but went on to secure maximum savings for
you. Fly coast-to-coast for $298 roundtrip or less on your choice of
several airlines. For example, if you want to fly from Burlington (VT) to
Los Angeles, the current 21-day advance purchase roundtrip is $742.
Between Seattle and Myrtle Beach, the current 21-day advance is $687. We
think you=01,ll agree that $298 looks a lot better. Discounts go as high as
60 percent for travel through August 15, 2001. Check out other travel Web
sites (we love competition), do some comparison shopping, and you can
understand how we=01,ve earned our low-fare wings and live up to the name,
Bestfares.com. For more information on our newest bargains, visit:

Fly between select U.S. cities for as low as $198 roundtrip through August

central cities on sale includes Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, St. Louis,
Minneapolis, Kansas City and many more. You have your choice of over 50
cities in the Eastern U.S.  These roundtrip fares range between $198 and

Your savings can be 60 percent or more. These prices are valid for travel
Monday through Thursday travel but for just $10 more each way, you can fly

AVOID AIRPORT DELAYS & MISSED FLIGHTS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
Are you heading toward an airport during the upcoming holidays?
Unfortunately, during this holiday season a record number of travelers
will take to the friendly skies which translates into huge crowds and
limited parking at the airport parking lots. Don=01,t waste valuable time
searching for an empty space in an over crowded parking lot. Just stop,
valet park, catch a shuttle and fly with our partner SunPark. SunPark is
offering spectacular holiday savings through the end of this year as low
as $6 per day.  They are also offering 20% off at all locations year-round
when you buy a convenient book of 10 pre-paid parking vouchers =01) which
also makes a great gift for the frequent flyer! If you live in one of the
cities below you should check out the economy and convenience of SunPark:
 Buffalo  Columbus  Houston
 Los Angeles  Memphis  Oklahoma City
 Philadelphia St. Louis  Washington, DC

Don=01,t be caught in the crowds this holiday season. Park your car at a
SunPark parking lot and enjoy savings and services not found at other
airport parking lots. For more information visit our feature story at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10107493 or visit the SunPark web
site at http://www.sunpark.com/sp_offrs.html.
