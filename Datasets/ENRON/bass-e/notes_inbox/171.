GORE CLAIMS TO WANT EVERY VOTE COUNTED, BUT REFUSES TO STOP
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO THROW OUT LEGAL VOTES FOR BUSH

Al Gore, News Conference, CNN, 11/27/00:
"Ignoring votes means ignoring democracy itself, and if we ignore
the votes of thousands in Florida in this election, how can you or
any American have confidence that your vote will not be ignored in
a future election?"

THE TRUTH:
 ~ If Gore wants all votes counted, ought to urge dismissal of
   their case.

 ~ The voters did nothing wrong - it was the result of computer
   error.  In an effort to make sure that voters received their
   ballots, local Republicans asked the Supervisor of Elections
   if they could manually fix the misprints - suit would
   disenfranchise 15,000 voters.

 ~ Democrats are trying to throw out all 15,000 absentee votes in
   Seminole County, even though less than 5,000 of the absentee
   ballot applications required correction, just to obtain a net
   gain of votes for Gore in Seminole County.

 ~ The number was on an APPLICATION, not on a ballot.

 ~ Both parties sent out materials like this.  A computer glitch
   caused approximately 5,000 Republican absentee requests to
   contain incorrect voter registration numbers.

 ~ This has NOTHING to do with the integrity of the ballots or the
   validity of votes.

LEGAL INFORMATION

 ~ No traction for the legal claim.

 ~ State law in no way bars what took place.

 ~ Merely corrected a Voter ID Number on an application.

 ~ Control on application is voter's signature and last four digits
   of Social Security Number which must be included and is provided
   by the voter.

 ~ Voter ID Numbers are public information

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT RULES THE PALM BEACH BALLOT IS LEGAL

Florida Supreme Court Ruling:
"[W]e conclude as a matter of law that the Palm Beach County
ballot does not constitute substantial noncompliance with the
statutory requirements mandating the voiding of the election."
 - Andre Fladell v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, 12/01/00


Gore's Legal Team Insisted The Ballot Was Illegal:

Former Secretary of State And Gore Advisor Warren Christopher:
"...there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting
from the ballot...that ballot was confusing and illegal, and that
rising out of this is the need for redress in order to make sure
that the will of the people can be properly honored..."
   - News Conference on Florida Recount, CNN, 11/09/00

GORE ASKED MIAMI MAYOR WHY MIAMI-DADE RECOUNT STOPPED

Miami Herald's Manny Garcia and Joseph Tanfani, 12/01/00:
"Hours after the Miami-Dade canvassing board called off its
recount, Gore phoned county Mayor Alex Penelas (D) asking for an
explanation.  Penelas said Gore 'asked him if 'there was anything
I could do to provide extra resources' to help the count go
forward.' Penelas also said 'Gore 'never pressured me''"

Washington Post
COUNTING ON SOME SLIPPERY LANGUAGE
George F. Will
11/30/00

"...despite the supposed sophistication of Boies, Gore &
Lieberman, all its arguments have rested on two braided
assertions, each too weak to gain significant strength from the
braiding:

"First, anything done with a ballot constitutes a cast vote.
Second, no vote can be considered counted until a presidential
intent has been ascribed to it, even if the ascription involves
intuiting the meaning of 'marks...barely discernible to the
human eye' (the words of Judge Charles Burton, who presided over
Palm Beach County's recount).

"Beneath such result-oriented lawyers' artistry lurks a
pernicious premise. It is that casting a ballot is a task so
challenging for many voters that the task cannot be completed
without the intervention of lawyers-as-intuitors.  This soft
bigotry of low expectations infused Al Gore's eerie speech
Monday evening."

HUNDREDS OF FELONS CAST VOTES ILLEGALLY: Since 1868, it has been
illegal for felons to cast ballots in Florida.
David Kidwell, Phil long and Geoff Dougherty
12/01/00

Excerpts:
"At least 445 Florida felons voted illegally on Nov. 7...

"The tainted votes -- found in a review of nearly half a million
votes cast in 12 Florida counties -- provide evidence that the
presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible
voters. Nearly six million voters in Florida's 67 counties cast
ballots.

"Nearly 75 percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The
Herald were cast by registered Democrats.

"The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue
that a large number of illegal votes were probably cast for his
opponent, outweighing the effect of any recount.

"'It's a very powerful argument,' said Robert Jarvis, a law
professor at Nova Southeastern University.

"The Herald found 62 robbers, 56 drug dealers, 45 killers, 16
rapists and seven kidnappers who cast ballots. At least two who
voted are pictured on the state's online registry of sexual
offenders.

"Clarence Eden Williams, 77, of Pahokee, also voted. His picture
is posted on the state registry of sexual offenders for his
crimes against children. His son was surprised his father cast a
ballot.

"'He's got Alzheimer's, and he can't even carry on a
conversation anymore,' said Clarence Williams III.

"The Herald review included...8 percent of the 5.9 million votes
cast on Nov. 7. It encompassed all votes cast in Palm Beach and
Pasco counties, most votes cast in Duval County, and only
absentee votes in Miami-Dade, Broward, Lee, Leon, Hillsborough,
Clay and the Panhandle counties of Escambia, Okaloosa and Bay.

"To find felony voters, The Herald compared a list of voters in
those counties with a Department of Corrections database listing
felons who had served at least a year in prison. If the pattern
found in the study is the same statewide, more than 5,000 felons
likely cast illegal ballots."

THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY
John McIntyre
11/30/00

For the past three weeks all we have heard from Democrats and
the media about the struggle in Florida is that "both sides are
at fault," "neither candidate has been presidential," and "a pox
on both your houses." This case for moral equivalency between
Bush and Gore is critical to the Democrats' argument. If, as the
rationale goes, both sides are to blame and the election ended
in a tie, then "why can't we just have a compromise that affords
both sides with a 50/50 chance win the Presidency?" This would
seem like a reasonable solution, provided those underlying
suppositions were true. The problem for Gore is that the
suppositions are not even close to being true. Both sides are not
to blame. And this election, while ridiculously close, did not
end a tie.

Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the
votes. He has had that recount of votes. When the recount upheld
the original result, that should have been the end of this
fiasco. However, even before the original recount was finished,
Gore, and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman, decided in
their minds that they really won the election. What has followed
has been their all-out assault to change what happened on
election day in Florida.
