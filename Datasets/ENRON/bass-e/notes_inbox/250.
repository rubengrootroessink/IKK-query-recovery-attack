I have selected December 7th and 8th as the days for us to get together in 
the Houston office to go over your year.  I will be able to retrieve your 
completed feedback reports by then and hopefully will have spoken to your 
supervisor.  Please send me your availability for those two days.  I will 
need 30 minutes but we should schedule for an hour. Be patient, I am between 
jobs and am my own assistant.  If you cannot meet on either day, (if you are 
in Brazil, for instance) we will work something out. (send a suggestion or 
two)  Please respond to this as soon as possible so I can get everyone 
scheduled.  Thanks

PS Please make sure you are sending emails to Don Black / SA/   not to Don 
Black / EES/  or Donald Black / ENA/
