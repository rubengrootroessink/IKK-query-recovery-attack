According to reports out of Foxboro, New England  Patriots quarterback Drew=
=20
Bledsoe took his regular  turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid=
ay=20
and all  indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as =
=20
usual against the Chiefs Monday night.=20

Of course, that hardly means Bledsoe is  100 percent healthy; he's anything=
=20
but. And whether it's jammed,  bruised, sprained, fractured, broken or just=
=20
plain old sore, the  real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th=
e=20
thumb on his  throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability=
=20
to  throw the ball.=20

Not surprisingly, head coach Bill  Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off=
=20
than he's been the  previous three weeks.=20

"This is the 13th week of the season.  There will be a lot of players out=
=20
there on both teams who will be  less than 100 percent, and (Chiefs=20
quarterback  Elvis) Grbac is one of them," said  Belichick. "Same thing wit=
h=20
our quarterback. That's football in the  13th week of the season."=20

Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in  Detroit on Thanksgiving day, but=
=20
regressed as the game progressed,  throwing two crucial fourth-quarter=20
interceptions that kept the team  from mounting a realistic comeback... And=
=20
even though Bledsoe  continues to insist the thumb isn't affecting his=20
throws, you'd be  hard-pressed to find any evidence backing that contention=
.=20

The bottom line here says a lack quality  depth at the key offensive skill=
=20
positions around him make it very  difficult to rely on Bledsoe for=20
consistent production...=20

Other items of interest...=20

Michael Felger of  the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with  the=
=20
weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at less-than-full speed,  coaches=
=20
would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs. The  question is whethe=
r=20
injury-prone J.R. Redmond will  be up to the task. If not, look for Belichi=
ck=20
to spread the load  between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass. =20

Reserve tight end Chris  Eitzmann (ribs) was placed on injured reserve for=
=20
the  season, leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill... Starting  wid=
e=20
out Troy Brown (leg) was the only player not  to fully participate at=20
practice and his availability is likely to  be determined by a dreaded game=
=20
day decision. =20

Cincinnati Enquirer reporter  Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals=
=20
head coach  Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as  "probable" to star=
t=20
at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals  tomorrow.=20

Mitchell missed last week's game against Pittsburgh  because of a sprained=
=20
left knee. This week, his mobility was better as he took  60 percent of the=
=20
practice snaps and Akili Smith took 40  percent.=20

=01&I think probable's a good word,=018 LeBeau said. =01&We're  gonna see h=
ow Scott's=20
knee responds, but he looks better every day.=018=20

Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Friday's  practice.=20

=01&I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to  go,=018 he said.=20

LeBeau said Mitchell probably won't need a Sunday  morning test, as he did=
=20
last week before the Pittsburgh game.=20

=01&I don't think that will be necessary, unless some  complications develo=
p=20
between today's workout and Sunday,=018 LeBeau said.=20

According to those who follow the team closely, the  Bengals would like to=
=20
use the team's remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before  attempting to=
=20
re-sign to the veteran signal caller to compete with third-year  man-to-be=
=20
Smith for the starting QB job next season.=20

Team president Mike Brown made the  statements after watching Mitchell=20
participate in his first practice in 10 days  Thursday...=20

Other items of interest...=20

Brown's continuous and vehement denials haven't  stopped the speculation=20
regarding his future role with the team...  SportsLine.com jumped on the=20
bandwagon this week when the  reported that the man I like to call the=20
"Neanderthal GM" is thinking seriously  about reducing his own role and=20
bringing in a "football man," along the lines of  former Steeler director o=
f=20
football operations and current ESPN  NFL maven Tom Donahoe, to handle the=
=20
day-to-day front office  duties...=20

Brown's response to another report stating that a  handful of "close friend=
"=20
had advised him to step down and let somebody else  handle the team's=20
football operations was classic:=20

"I don't have five friends," he stated flatly... =20

And finally... Rookie wide out Peter  Warrick said his skipping a=20
team-mandated eye appointment last Tuesday  was an oversight. But if he ski=
ps=20
another one it will cost him.=20

Team officials set up the checkup because they  believe Warrick needs conta=
ct=20
lenses. Receivers coach Steve  Mooshagian felt strongly enough about it to=
=20
levy a $600 fine if Warrick  goes AWOL again...

ESPN's John Clayton reported last night  that New York Jets halfback Curtis=
=20
Martin took all  of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday'=
s=20
game  against the Colts.=20

Martin still has a bruised gluteus  maximus, but he's in better shape than=
=20
last week. The fact that he  opened the week listed a probable rather than=
=20
starting out as  questionable like last week has to be a good sign.=20

And if you asked me, head coach  Al Groh seemed to be quite a bit more upbe=
at=20
this  week, at one point responding to a reporters request that he assess =
=20
Martin's current condition by saying, "Fine, fine..."=20

That's about as in-depth, detailed and  upbeat reply I've heard him utter=
=20
this season.=20

But seriously folks... The soreness in  Martin's booty could linger, but it=
=20
won't keep the former Patriot  out of the lineup... And with Bernie Parmale=
e =20
emerging as a legitimate threat in a relief role, the Jets seem to  be=20
capable of getting the job done.=20

Also of interest this morning...=20

Rookie tight end Anthony  Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the=
=20
sore knee  that's bothered him the last two weeks. However, the youngtster=
=20
is  expected to start and play as usual at this point... Fellow rookie =20
Laveranues Coles will miss his second straight game  with a knee sprain and=
=20
his absence has clearly left a void in the  team's vertical passing game th=
e=20
last two weeks... On a more postive  note, Coles was able to get some light=
=20
work in during practice late  this week and could return at or near full=20
speed sometime next  week... In the meantime, Windrell Hayes will  continue=
=20
to come off the bench as the number-three man until Coles  return...=20

Former Steeler wide out Malcolm  Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste=
m=20
as expected,  Groh said. The newcomer's biggest challenge is simply learnin=
g=20
how  the Jets operate.=20

"He's getting more comfortable with the  plays and the words," Groh said.=
=20
"Every team has a different  language and you have to adjust to that. He=20
seems to be a quick  student, he just needs to get through all the=20
lessons..."=20

And finally... While the Jets obviouly  have some kind of plan in mind for=
=20
implementing Leon  Johnson, it's too early to tell when he might be able to=
 =20
follow through on such a plan.=20

"We saw some of the skills that made him  a good player in the past," Groh=
=20
said of Johnson's first workout  with the team on Wednesday. "But you also=
=20
saw that he started  training camp (Wednesday)."=20

After blowing out his left knee in the  Jets' season opener last year,=20
Johnson is eager to work his way back  into the mix...=20

"Some guys take two days to get ready in  training camp," Groh said. "Some=
=20
guys take 10 days or two weeks.  That's where we are with Leon."=20

"I'm feeling good," Johnson said. "It's  just real good to be back out ther=
e.=20
That's really all I'm concerned  with right now."=20

The Jets would love for him to return to  form quickly so he can resume=20
kick-return duties soon and relieve  Dedric Ward, who has not been=20
impressive... =20

According to reports out of Carolina tonight, the  Panthers will hit the=20
field this Sunday without Tim  Biakabutuka, who is struggling to overcome a=
=20
painful turf  toe injury, for the third week in a row... According to  ESPN=
=20
NFL insider John Clayton, the  Panthers deactivated the former first-round=
=20
draft pick because they  didn't want to ruin his chances of playing the fin=
al=20
three weeks of  the season.=20

Brad Hoover, an  undrafted rookie from Western Carolina, will continue to=
=20
line up as  the starting halfback.=20

His 117-yard, one-TD performance in  Monday night's win over the Packers=20
added exponentially to the  sudden celebrity status Hoover attained after h=
is=20
first game as the  starter.=20

"This whole thing has just been crazy,"  he said. "I've never gotten this=
=20
much attention before and I'm still  trying to figure out how to handle it.=

Count St. Louis signal caller  Kurt Warner among Hoover's fans...=20

"I always like that stuff, it's always  good to see guys that were never=20
given much of a chance to come in  and really make a name and do well for=
=20
themselves," the former Arena  League star noted...=20

Heck, Biakabutuka even admitted to mixed  emotions as he stood on the=20
sidelines watching fans respond to  Hoover in a way they've never responded=
=20
to him. However, the former  University of Michigan star also realizes just=
=20
how hard Hoover has  worked -- in almost total obscurity -- prior to gettin=
g=20
this break,  all of which made it hard not to be happy for his teammate.=20

But Biakabutuka also found himself just a  little bit worried after teammat=
e=20
Michael Bates  told him the story of fella named Wally Pipp, who  played=20
first base for the New York Yankees. Or at least he did until  the day this=
=20
new kid named Lou Gehrig came along  and filled in for him...=20

"I don't want to be Wally Pipp,"  Biakabutuka said earnestly.=20

Other items of interest...=20

Wide receiver Donald  Hayes, who missed Monday night's game with a groin=20
injury,  is expected to return to the starting lineup this week.=20

Veteran fullback William  Floyd will also spend another week on the inactiv=
e=20
list;  Chris Hetherington will continue to start in his  place...
