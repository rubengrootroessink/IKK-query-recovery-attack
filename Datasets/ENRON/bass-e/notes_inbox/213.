THE HOTBOX - Real customers who are really happy about Hotwire deals. 

"I was 3,000 miles from NY, but no way was I missing the first Subway 
Series in 44 years. I went online Tuesday to check fares for that 
Friday. Hotwire saved me over $800, compared to other online fares. 
What's more, when I missed my crucial connecting flight, the airline 
attendant went out of her way to ensure my arrival to NY. My 
experience with Hotwire was great - the only downside was that the 
Mets lost." 
Mike Mancuso, San Diego, CA
