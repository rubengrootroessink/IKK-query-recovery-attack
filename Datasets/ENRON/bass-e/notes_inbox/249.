My friend Catherine Miller, local Denver resident  and Broncos fanatic told 
me tonight that the Channel 9 News in Denver is  reporting that Terrell Davis 
is out indefinitely.? They've found  inflammation in his shin bone and are 
now immobilizing his leg with a  cast.? They're not yet saying he's out the 
for the season but it definitely  does not look good at this point.? More as 
I hear it.? Thanks  Cat!
