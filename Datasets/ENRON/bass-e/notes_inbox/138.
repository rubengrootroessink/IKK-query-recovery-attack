Hi  Folks

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20
Players.? As we head down the home  stretch, identifying those players movi=
ng=20
up or down can be the difference  between?dominating the playoffs or watchi=
ng=20
from the sidelines.? As we head into our 15th week  of listing these player=
s,=20
it=01,s inevitable that some guys will have made both the  upgrade or downg=
rade=20
list.? Make  sure you understand, what we=01,re talking about is players th=
at=20
are moving.? In other words, a player like TE Ricky  Dudley could appear on=
=20
the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league=
.?=20
It just  means I=01,m concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Like=
wise,=20
a player like WR Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he=
=01,s=20
still fairly far down the  list of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction=
=20
players are moving.?  Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often=
=20
make all the  difference.

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.? =20
Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs as h=
e =20
went 30 for 48.? The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appea=
rs=20
Brooks will continue to air the ball out.? Yes, he'll make some  young QB=
=20
mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as =
he=20
does TDs.? I expect him to throw a lot of both.? I almost  started him over=
=20
Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull the  trigger.? Manning wa=
s=20
solid but Brooks was better.

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here=
=20
he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=
7=20
was no  fluke.? He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked=
=20
out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill=
=20
Cowher or  Stewart)? The TD rush was highlight material.? His problem all=
=20
along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it now.?=
=20
Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=
ut=20
on a  horrid display when he was in the game.? He's  awful.

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks=
=20
ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler "was as pretty as anything Dan=
=20
Marino  ever threw".? Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair=
ly=20
often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going =
to=20
have an  advantage in their cold weather.? Didn't play out that way.?=20
Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.

QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)? We had him high in week 14 like we have all year and=
=20
he  didn't disappoint.? WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently=20
Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.? =
=20
The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded  them=
.

QB Brett Favre  (GB)? I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu=
y=20
just  does what it takes to get the job done.? He'd be much better off if W=
R =20
Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill=20
Schroeder's  doing a great job.?=20

QB Jeff George  (Was)? Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to=20
keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.?=20
George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year.?=20
Although  tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.? I'm =
a=20
Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.? We'll see how=
=20
it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that=
=20
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to=
=20
be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if=
=20
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=
he=20
stretch  run.?=20

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's =
=20
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't =
=20
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says "yes".? Ok, rushing=
=20
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he=
=20
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge=
=20
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as=
=20
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to =
=20
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It look=
s=20
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=
g=20
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed=
=20
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have t=
o=20
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up=
 =20
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for S=
an=20
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=
e=20
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look=
=20
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and=
=20
looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore=
=20
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be =
=20
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total =
=20
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could =
=20
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?=
=20
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=
h=20
a  shot.

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf =
=20
resurgence.? He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues=
 =20
to improve.

WR Willie Jackson  (NO)? Jackson's officially moved past the "flash in the=
=20
pan" stage  with another solid day.? Aaron Brooks continues to look good at=
=20
QB.?  Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no=
w,=20
he's  looking good.

WR Joe Horn  (NO)? Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime =
=20
recipient.? Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should =20
continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20
starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.? He found the endzone again and continues=
=20
to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.

WR Terrell Owens  (SF)? The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a=20
solid day  from Terrell Owens.? He's a huge boost to the offense when he ca=
n=20
go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.? Keep an eye out fo=
r=20
how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just includi=
ng=20
him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =
of=20
choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=
d=20
have no  trouble starting Carswell each week.

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=
e=20
play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB =
=20
Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another=
=20
solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a=
s=20
he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t=
he=20
5 yard  line.

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=
l=20
of play  for all the Saints receivers.? Glover made a couple of nice plays=
=20
Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

?

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his =
=20
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem=
=20
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=
m=20
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the=
=20
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing =
=20
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George =
=20
looks bad for a few series...

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=
ve=20
been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob=20
Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=
.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is=
=20
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some =
=20
frustrations saying for all he knew, "he might be punting this week".? I =
=20
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him=
 =20
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an=
=20
ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well=
=20
that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=
f=20
his  star.? When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess=
=20
with  the one thing that's working.

Philadelphia  RBs? Forget about them.? This team will live and die by =20
Donovan McNabb.

RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)? Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind=20
Terrell Fletcher  now.? That's gotta hurt...

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)? This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu=
s=20
as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto=
r=20
when he  returns.? He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.

WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)? Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in=
=20
a  tailspin.? New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso=
n =20
which could spell more bad things for Mathis.

WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)? Forget about it.? Donovan McNa=
bb=20
can  be a solid QB without WRs.

WRs James McKnight / Wayne  McGarity (Dal)? These guys just aren't very=20
McGood.? QB Troy  Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self.

WR Marcus Robinson  (Chi)? Robinson's back troubles were apparently more=20
serious than  many had expected.? It was announced Monday that he'll likely=
=20
miss the rest  of the season with a bulging disk in his back.? It appears h=
e=20
can get by  without surgery but he's certainly not looking good.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TEs Marcus Pollard / Ken  Dilger (Ind)? Neither of these guys did much=20
Sunday.? This  offense clearly isn't in the same groove it was earlier this=
=20
year.? =20

TEs Jackie Harris / David  LaFleur (Dal)? More bad news associated with Tro=
y=20
Aikman.?  Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I don't see that=
=20
changing very  quickly.

TE Pete Mitchell  (NYG)? One of the bigger disappointments at TE this seaso=
n,=20
he  just can't get untracked.
