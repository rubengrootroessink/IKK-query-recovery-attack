Hi Folks,

We've been downgrading Chicago WR Marcus Robinson already with Shane
Matthews throwing the ball but here's more bad news from my friends at
www.nfltalk.com

http://www.sportstalk.com/nfl/rumors/index.shtml From the article:  The
Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this
weekend's game with Green Bay and his status will be updated tomorrow.

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.



Joe
