Dear  Amazon Video Customer,


[IMAGE][IMAGE]  
  


As one of our loyal Video customers, you might like to  know  that our 
Amazon.com Video store is two years old  this month.  And since you've helped 
us get where we  are today, consider  yourself cordially invited to the  
party. Our Second  Anniversary Store features stellar videos at  savings  of 
up to 40% through November 20.

As  Porky's quote implies, our selection is truly out of this  world. Our 
editors have gathered an exceptional array of  can't-miss videos--from 
classics to sci-fi, action to yoga,  there's something for video lovers of 
all tastes. Our customers  have also helped decorate our Second Anniversary  
Store.  You'll find over a dozen lists of customer  favorites--all top 
sellers from the last two  years.  It's an incredibly diverse selection, 
from  hilarious spoofs  like Galaxy Quest to  fascinating histories like The 
Civil  War: A Ken  Burns Film. 

So  drop by our Second  Anniversary Store and help us celebrate two years  
of  great videos. You'll save up to 40% on our deals  of the  week--now 
that's a happy  b-b-birthday.

We  look forward to seeing you.  

Sincerely,
