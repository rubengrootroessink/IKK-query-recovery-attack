 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.
