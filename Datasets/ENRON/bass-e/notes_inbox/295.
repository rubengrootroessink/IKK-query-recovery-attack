Latest Terrell Davis Info  From Adam Schefter in the Denver Post:  From the
article   http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/brnx1121b.htm   "This is the
kind of season it has been for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis: He
has twice as many magnetic resonance imaging tests as touchdowns.
Davis underwent his fourth MRI on Monday and, like the previous three, the
results were negative. Yet Davis still is concerned enough about his lower
left leg, which has been bothering him for nearly a month and wants a
specialist in San Francisco to study the results.
"It's just kind of a cross-check with a guy that's known to be pretty good,"
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. "He's still quite sore, and we want to
make sure that we rule out all possibilities."
But not even the specialist in San Francisco will be able to predict whether
Davis will be able to play Sunday in Seattle, or any time in the near
future.
"I thought he was going to play this last week; then he set it back and
didn't practice Saturday morning," Shanahan said. "I don't think anybody
knows. We just have to wait and see."
At this point, the Broncos are carrying on as if rookie running backs Mike
Anderson and KaRon Coleman will be carrying the load. "You've got to,"
Shanahan said. "If he's there, it's a plus, and we'd like him to be there
full speed.
"But he keeps on setting that leg back. How long that pain's going to be
there I don't think anybody knows. We'll just have to go on. Mike Anderson
did a great job last game, played exceptionally well, and he has got to pick
up the slack.''



My View:   Mike Shanahan is no Bill Belichick, when it comes to coachspeak,
but he's not far behind.  He's saying basically the only things he can say.
If I'm a Terrell Davis owner, I probably sit him this week unless I just
didn't have many other options.  I'd say the chances of him playing
effectively this week are in the 40% range.  Anderson had 138 total yards
Sunday.  He ran for 97 yards on 19 carries for a 5.1 yard per carry average.
And that was against a San Diego rush defense that was ranked # 2 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four games.  In other words, the
running game isn't a big problem for Mike Shanahan right now.  He's got
other things to worry about (like replacing CB Ray Crockett).  The fact they
haven't been able to nail down the exact problem is worrisome to me.  Bottom
line is I'm thinking Anderson as of right now.

Good Luck!

Joe
