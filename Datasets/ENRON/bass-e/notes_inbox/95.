Hi Folks,

Passing along an email from my friend Michael Germain. :   "It is being
reported in Dallas by 1310 The Ticket Radio, that Chris Warren
has been released by the Cowboys today. A press conference is scheduled for
this afternoon with Dave Campo. Just an FYI."

Thanks Michael and also thanks to our buddy Daniel Dunsworth for the info.
I doubt you had Warren starting on your playoff bound FF team but this says
a lot about their faith in Emmitt Smith.  Michael Wiley likely backs up
Smith now but for them to cut Warren loose with Smith just a few games
removed from a concussion is a pretty strong statement.  Smith proved once
again last week he's a gamer I'd think removing the threat of Warren
stealing a few carries has to slightly increase his value.

Have a nice evening.

Joe
