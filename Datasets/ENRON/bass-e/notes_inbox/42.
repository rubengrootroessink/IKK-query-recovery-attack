Latest NBA Player News Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Th=

Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily as=

Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.  Chris Dudley , C PHO -=

Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Dudley was activated from the injured list and=

Dudley could be of good use in a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him i=
n=20
a smaller one.    Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Garces=
=20
was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.  Garces is=
=20
suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as a third=

center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.  Donyell Marshall , F UTA=

Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Marshall had missed the two games prior to=20
Thursday's action because of a sprained knee, but returned to the lineup=20
against Vancouver and had seven points and three rebounds in 14 minutes. =
=20
Because Marshall comes off the bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  B=
ut=20
with him back in the rotation forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will=
=20
play less minutes now.     Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated=20
12/08/00Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained=20
knee.  He is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absen=
ce=20
will force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have=
=20
positive or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston=20
frontcourt players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or=
=20
flounder under the current conditions.    Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Age=
nt=20
Updated 12/08/00Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make roo=
m=20
for the injured Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receiv=
e=20
enough playing time to be a valuable Fantasy player.     Greg Buckner , G D=
AL=20
- Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Buckner will undergo surgery early next week t=
o=20
remove a cracked bone spur on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline=
=20
Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie Donnell Harvey was activated form the injure=
d=20
list to make room for Buckner.   This is the second time this season that h=
e=20
has been sidelined with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckn=
er=20
for he rest of the season or until he is playing and producing on a=20
consistent basis again.     Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated=20
12/08/00Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to=
=20
return to the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State. =20
"Oak," who was suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, h=

outside of deeper leagues.    Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Update=
d=20
12/08/00Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as=
=20
though Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden=
=20
State Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is excitin=
g=20
about the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=
=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00Hill was a game time scratch =
on=20
Thursday night against the Nuggets. The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that=
=20
Hill is expected to return to the court on Monday when the Magic travel to=
=20
Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. Hill's return is long overdue for=
=20
Fantasy owners who held onto his rights this season. Unless you have a numb=
er=20
of solid forwards on your roster, give Hill the start this week pending any=
=20
setbacks.    Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Turkoglu=
=20
is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for Friday's game=
=20
against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but has very littl=
e=20
Fantasy value.     Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Nash=20
returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two straight=
=20
games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by the injur=
y=20
as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is now safe to=
=20
play Nash on your Fantasy team again.     Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free=
=20
Agent Updated 12/07/00Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is=20
questionable for Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters=
=20
Bryon Russell and Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid=
=20
using Marshall until he appears to be fully recovered.    Kevin Garnett , F=
=20
MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his right ring finger i=
n=20
Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined Wednesday.  He is=20
expected to play against the Wizards Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation=
. =20
Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting hand could lead to=
=20
an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.    Terry Davis , F DEN -=
=20
Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Davis will be eligible to come off the injured=
=20
list Sunday but Achilles tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep hi=
m=20
sidelined a little bit longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his=20
career and doesn't have much Fantasy value.    Antonio McDyess , F DEN - Th=
e=20
Rounders Updated 12/07/00McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday=
's=20
game against the Heat and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against th=
e=20
Magic.  Keon Clark will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play=
. =20
The leg is sore now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few=20
days.    Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00Hill may be ready to=
=20
return to the court for Thursday night's game against the Nuggets. He has=
=20
missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he practiced on=20
Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court. "I can't giv=
e=20
you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but it looks good=
."=20
Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will likely get him=
=20
back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a four-game West Coast=
=20
road trip.   Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00According to T=
he=20
Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful that Trent will=
=20
travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on the East Coast=
. =20
Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could be back in acti=
on=20
in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the first preseason game=
=20
with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good inside scorer and a=
=20
solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return Fantasy owners=20
should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately need a forward. =
  =20
 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00Marbury miss=
ed=20
his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an ankle injury. =
He=20
turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned it again the=20
following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is still lacking=
=20
some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle is=20
diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host the=
=20
Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their=
=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.  Vince Carter=
 ,=20
G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Carter was in uniform for Wednesday=
=20
night's game against Portland, but he didn't see any playing time. "Air=20
Canada" said that he felt well enough to play, but team doctors wouldn't gi=
ve=20
him permission to get in the game. "We'd like to have him back as soon as=
=20
possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, "but we're not going to bring him=
=20
back before he's ready." Toronto finishes their three-game West Coast swing=
=20
on Friday night against Golden State, at which time Carter hopes to make hi=
s=20
return. The Raptors' star should be back before Monday, so most Fantasy=20
owners can re-insert him into their lineup in time for next week.    Andre=
=20
Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00Miller took a knee to the nos=
e=20
during Wednesday night's game at Chicago which sent him to the bench=20
temporarily. He returned to the game with a vengeance, finishing with 20=20
points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The sho=
t=20
to the nose won't keep Miller from missing any playing time, so continue to=
=20
use the young point guard in your starting lineup.    Elton Brand , F CHI -=
=20
Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Brand missed his second consecutive game on=
=20
Wednesday night against Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with hi=
s=20
hyperextended left knee, and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.=
 =20
Brand is listed as day to day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chan=
ce=20
of playing on Friday night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurri=
ng=20
on Monday, Fantasy owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in the=
ir=20
lineup for next week's games.   Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated=
=20
12/06/00The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT sc=
an=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20
Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Dudley will travel with t=
he=20
Suns on their end of the week road-trip that starts in Milwaukee Thursday. =
=20
He will most likely be questionable for all the games.  Look for him to=20
finally return to action next week.  With Dudley out of the lineup Corie=20
Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to get playing time.  With=
=20
the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding makes him a starter on you=
r=20
Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his position.    Chris Mills , F=
=20
GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game=20
against the Lakers because of pain in his right ankle.  He was scheduled to=
=20
see a foot specialist on Tuesday and underwent surgery last season to remov=
e=20
bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills on your Fantasy bench for now.  If yo=
u=20
are playing in a small league drop him from your roster and add another=20
forward.     Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00Merc=
er=20
sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.  Corey=
=20
Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status for=

Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment so f=
ar=20
this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your roster,=
=20
if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The way Merc=
er=20
has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better guard.  =
 =20
Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Williams sprained his=
=20
ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is questionable for=20
Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably limit Williams'=20
production in the next few games so use a healthy forward instead.    Billy=

Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Owens strained his right biceps =
in=20
Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He has actually been productive this=20
season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.  Owens has been injury prone=
=20
throughout his career and is too risky a player to take a chance on.  Use a=
=20
more durable player instead.     Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated=20
12/06/00Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He=
=20
scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the=
=20
starting lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With a=

increased role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.    John=20
Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Wallace was placed on the=20
injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.  He is a good offensive=20
player but his shortcomings on defense have limited his playing time.  His=
