 Latest NFL Player News 

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.  

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season 
after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right 
wrist. He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, 
but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist. Burress had 
it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require 
surgery. With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place 
for the next four games.  

 Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for 
Sunday's game against Jacksonville. He has performed fairly well spelling 
fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself 
consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001. He won't provide you with 
much this season, though.  

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee 
injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, 
who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns. Fortunately, 
linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a 
groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both 
expected to play. Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be 
the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland 
offense that has been decimated by injuries.   

 Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 "The Green Lantern" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, 
catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game. After four solid 
weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two 
games. He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight 
catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly 
not out of the question. Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet 
will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.    

 Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game 
in Jacksonville. If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the 
starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end. Even if he's 
healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.  

 Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six 
passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears. Although Anderson's 
numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of 
Fantasy isn't as solid. Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid 
playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.      

 O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game 
in Jacksonville on Sunday. If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup 
tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as 
Campbell's backup for the second straight game. We don't recommend any of the 
Browns' tight ends.  

 Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while 
splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after 
injuring his gluteus maximus. Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 
yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.  Starting Parmalee in 
the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to 
another option if possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at 
quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs 
don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one. Pederson was held 
out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the 
week, and looks to be a gametime decision. Palmer may opt to use rookie 
Spergon Wynn this week either way. Considering the Browns' struggles in the 
passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to 
help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on 
evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to 
compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season. Team president 
Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his 
first practice in 10 days yesterday. Mitchell is expected to start Sunday 
against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee 
ligament. Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your 
league's playoff run.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals 
with a quadricep injury.  The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he 
has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.  Avoid 
starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.  He is 
far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy 
season.     

 David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.  
He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help 
his numbers in recent weeks.  He has had only one game with more than 90 
yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same 
span. If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could 
be against the Bengals. Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, 
starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.     

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any 
help to a Fantasy team this season.  He was recently activated from the 
injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.    

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00 
 Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.  He suffered 
a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.  If he is unable to 
play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.  The Saints have 
been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who 
their RB is.  But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton 
who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to 
a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this 
point in the season. Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, 
and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes 
while compiling 193 yards of total offense. He also scored the Cardinals' 
only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown. Pittman will 
face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the 
run, so he could be in line for another strong performance. The only thing 
that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if 
Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the 
season is winding down.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is 
healthy enough to play.  He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and 
will be evaluated from thereafter.  Wilkins has missed the past few games 
because of a quadriceps injury.  

 Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the 
Rams.  He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.  Hayes 
hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy 
teams.    

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00 
 It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the 
Panthers.  Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf 
toe.  He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the 
Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.  
"I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I 
thought it would be," head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer . 
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.  Although Hoover 
had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on 
your Fantasy team.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's 
game against the Steelers. Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved 
around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to 
play. Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if 
he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured 
that he will play.     

 Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.  He had played 
in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on 
November 1.  He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use 
to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.   

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. "Right now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see 
what (today) brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight "tweak" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. "I feel fine," Smith 
said, "I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now "optimistic" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. "If he's OK 
(today), he's starting," said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Meximullets Player News 

 Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00 
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and 
scoring a touchdown. Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a 
thin Atlanta Falcons defense. 

 Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00 
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only 
three passes for 37 yards. He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from 
Brett Favre. No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had 
last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on 
stopping Freeman. His numbers will improve this week but only slightly. 

 Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00 
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens. He rushed three 
times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards. Unless Stephen 
Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action. 

 Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday 
night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' 
secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the 
team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups 
this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. 

 Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00 
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday. He gained 
62 yards on 17 carries. 

 Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00 
With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start 
this week against the Chiefs. If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks 
this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available. 

 Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday. Look for 
Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00 
Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career 
game for him against Dallas Sunday. Just one week after an eight-catch, 
111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 
138 yards. Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to 
the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, 
but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future. 

 Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00 
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on 
Thanksgiving Day. He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly 
having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the 
regular season. However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he 
used to. Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 
yards. Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this 
week. 

 Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 
Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner. 

 Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 
Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer 
and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their 
standing with the team. This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but 
could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games. "We've talked about it," 
Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times . "I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a 
little bit, either. ... If a situation presented itself when you could put 
your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess 
we would consider that." 

 Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00 
The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches. He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday. 

 Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00 
On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards. If you start him at anytime 
during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye. 

 Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00 
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the 
Rams. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber 
has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Washington will 
need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have 
any chance at beating the champs in the dome.
