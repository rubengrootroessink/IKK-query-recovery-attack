I saw you called last night.  What was up?  I tried to call a few times.  Is
there any way wew can meet today or tomorrow for the TV?  It is due and I
would rather pay you some money instead another wasted payment with them.
BTW, how much is the payout for most points in the league?  How much for
second?
