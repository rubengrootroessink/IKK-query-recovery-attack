Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see  the matchups this week.? Please=
 =20
note, see the cheatsheet online  http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm=
?
for exactly where I rank players  and to determine who to start.? Just =20
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't=20
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup=
=20
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to decidi=
ng=20
between players.??=20

Locks:? These games heavily favor the  Offense

Tennessee=01,s Eddie George vs Brown  Defense?? Assuming Eddie George can g=
et=20
his  injured toe healthy (and I think he can) he could have a monster game=
=20
against a  Brown Defense that=01,s been terrible against the rush.? For the=
=20
year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and they=
=20
rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  Th=
e=20
Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the  Ravens=
=20
and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the  Browns.

Miami=01,s Lamar Smith vs Jets  Defense?? You=01,ll have to look awfully ha=
rd  to=20
find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith.?  In their week?8 matchup, he ran for 2=
=20
TDs and 155 yards.? At the time, it seemed like a fluke but  Smith has=20
maintained almost that pace since then.? Jay Fiedler and the passing game=
=20
provide  just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does=
=20
the  rest.? Over the last four weeks, the  Jets rank # 26 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed per  game.

New York Giant=01,s Ron Dayne / Tiki  Barber vs Lion Defense?? As you know =
by=20
now, the Giants  running game is governed by how close they keep the game.?=
=20
Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground  game (especially Ron Dayne=01,s role=
)=20
when the Giants start to trail.? Against a less than explosive Lions  team,=
=20
the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of  th=
e=20
way.? Detroit=01,s been weak  defending the run over the last four weeks wh=
ere=20
they rank # 25 in rushing yards  allowed per game.? =20

Indianapolis=01, Edgerrin James vs Packer  Defense?? Green Bay=01,s allowin=
g 135=20
yards  rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them # 22.? Jam=
es=20
should continue to roll this week  against a Packer Defense that=01,s missi=
ng LB=20
Brian Williams who=01,s out with a knee  injury.? DE Vonnie Holiday may be =
=20
limited but he looks like he=01,ll play and that=01,s some concern but I st=
ill=20
look  for James to romp.

Baltimore=01,s Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy  Defense?? The Cowboys gave up their 2=
00=20
yard  rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but =
I=01,
m  guessing power running Jamal Lewis (who=01,s almost as quick as those gu=
ys)=20
will be  a great play against Dallas.? For  the season, Dallas ranks # 28 i=
n=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Look for him to catch the ball=
=20
out of  the backfield as well.

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

San Diego=01,s  Terrell Fletcher / Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense??  Ov=
er=20
the last four week, Denver ranks # 31 in rushing yards allowed per  game.??=
=20
This  game smells a lot like the Denver / Bengal game to me.? Winless team=
=20
comes into town with a big  power back and nothing to lose.? We  all rememb=
er=20
Corey Dillon=01,s record setting day and many remember Jermaine  Fazande=01=
,s big=20
day rushing in the last game of 1999 against the Broncos.? Terrell Fletcher=
=20
is working his way into  the mix and that=01,s really muddying the waters.?=
 Keep=20
an eye on this one and if it looks  like one of these guys will garner the=
=20
bulk of the carries, he could be worth a  flyer.? =20



Philadelphia=01,s Stanley Pritchett / Darnell Autry vs  Cardinal Defense? T=
he=20
Arizona defense remains pretty weak  against the rush.? They rank # 29  in=
=20
rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.? For the year, th=
ey=20
rank # 31  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? The trick is=20
determining which Eagle RB  will get the carries.? I like  Pritchett becaus=
e=20
he=01,s bigger and can bull doze his way through the Cards.? I=01,ve been d=
own on=20
Autry as I believe  you=01,re supposed to have the acting career?after the=
=20
football career, not  the other way around=01(?

Arizona=01,s  Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense??  Watch this one closely as=
=20
Pittman is struggling to get healthy with  bruised ribs.? If he can go, I=
=20
like  the matchup this week.? Philadelphia  ranks # 30 in rushing  yards=20
allowed per game over the last four weeks.? They=01,re stronger over the ye=
ar=20
where  they rank # 18 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Thoma=
s=20
Jones is in worse shape with  pneumonia so Pittman has incentive to get out=
=20
there.?

Buffalo=01,s  Sammy Morris / Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense??  Morris battli=
ng a=20
bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision.? Bryson is plenty capable i=
f=20
he can=01,t  go.? The Chiefs are an attractive  matchup as they rank # 28 i=
n=20
rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks.? They rank # 27 i=
n=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB for the year.?  Watch this one=
=20
closely to see if the Bills offer hints to who=01,ll they=01,ll  go with.?

Green Bay=01,s  Ahman Green vs Colt Defense?? With Dorsey Levens out again,=
 =20
Green will be asked to carry the load?  The Colts are vulnerable to the rus=
h=20
ranking # 24 in rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks.? =
If=20
Brett Favre can play, that=01,ll be a  nice boost for Green as the defense =
won=01,t=20
be able to key on stopping the ground  game.?

Cincinnati=01,s  Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense?? How much would you rely =
on=20
Scot  Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau??  Me neither.? Whether it=01,s  Aki=
li=20
Smith or Scott Mitchell under center, it=01,s still the Corey Dillon  Show.=
? New=20
England has shown itself  to vulnerable against the rush ranking # 23 in=20
rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks.? Dillon knows he=
=20
needs to carry the team  and he=01,ll do his best.? His success  will depen=
d on=20
how effect Mitchell can be in drawing the defense=01,s attention  toward th=
e=20
passing game.

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way

San Francisco=01,s Charlie Garner vs  Falcon Defense??  Charlie Garner =20
continues his great season against a Falcon team that=01,s playing better r=
ush =20
defense than it had been.? For the  year, Atlanta ranks # 30 in Fantasy=20
Points allowed to the opposing RB but over  the last four weeks, they rate =
#=20
19 in rushing yards allowed per game.? If they=01,re without WR Terrell Owe=
ns =20
again, Garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load, something h=
e=01,
s  gladly done all year.



Pittsburgh=01,s Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar  Defense?? With the WR shuffling go=
ing=20
on in  Pittsburgh, I think Bettis is really the only Steeler worthy of=20
starting in most  leagues.? He=01,s a solid performer  though that should h=
ave=20
another good day grinding the ball out.? Jacksonville ranks # 18 over the=
=20
last  four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game.? For the year, they ran=
k=20
# 20 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  It=01,ll be power foo=
tball=20
as the Steeler just line up and try to run over  the Jaguars.?

New England=01,s J.R. Redmond / Kevin  Faulk vs Bengal Defense?? The Bengal=
s are=20
tough to  predict.? For the last four weeks,  they rank # 17 in rushing yar=
ds=20
allowed per game and for the year they come in  at # 14 in Fantasy Points=
=20
allowed to the opposing RB.? But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt  Smith=
=20
last week.? I look for Redmond  and Faulk to have moderate success against=
=20
this improving unit.? Redmond is questionable with ribs so  keep an eye on=
=20
this one.?

Chicago=01,s James Allen vs Buccaneer  Defense?? As with the pass defense,=
=20
Tampa  Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation.? For the=
=20
last four weeks, they rank # 16  in rushing yards allowed per game allowing=
=20
106 per game.? For the year, they rate # 9 in Fantasy  Points allowed to th=
e=20
opposing RBs so it=01,s not like they=01,re invincible.? With Shane Matthew=
s behind=20
center and  scaring no one though, it could be a long  day.?

Washington=01,s Stephen Davis vs Ram  Defense?? As is so often the case, th=
e =20
Redskins could be forced to abandon their running game if the Rams jump out=
 =20
early.? Washington would dearly love  to establish Stephen Davis on the=20
ground but they may not be able to if they=01,re  forced to play catchup.? =
The=20
Rams  rate # 15 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game.=
?=20
For the year, they check in at # 23 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the=20
opposing RB.?  Even with Bud Carson helping coach the defense, they can be=
=20
run  upon.?

Atlanta=01,s Jamal Anderson vs 49er  Defense?? Jamal Anderson continues to =
make =20
solid improvement and he seems close to his 1998 form to me.? He=01,ll face=
 a=20
49er Defense that can  definitely be run on.? Over the last  four weeks, th=
ey=20
rate # 14 in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year,  they rank # =
29=20
in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Not unlike the situation wit=
h =20
Washington, the running back=01,s success largely hinges on the ability of =
the =20
defense to hang tough.? Anderson can  be taken out of the game if the Falco=
ns=20
can=01,t hold Jeff Garcia and company down  in the passing game.???

Minnesota=01,s Robert Smith vs Panther  Defense? I=01,ve said for years I=
=01,d love to=20
see  Robert Smith play a full season and now we=01,re seeing that could loo=
k=20
like.? He=01,s having a great year and I think  he=01,ll continue to have s=
uccess=20
against Carolina.? They=01,ve been pretty strong lately  against the rush=

ranking # 11 in rushing yards allowed per game over the last  four weeks bu=

If the Vikings can  control Carolina=01,s Steve Beuerlein (no small feat), =
it=01,ll=20
help Smith=01,s chances  immensely.

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Jacksonville=01,s  Fred Taylor vs Steeler Defense?? Fred Taylor is beginnin=
g to=20
work  his way out most Fantasy GM=01,s dog house as he continues to be a br=
ight=20
spot on a  team without many bright spots.?  He=01,s been running hard but =
this=20
will be a real gut check for him as he  squares off against a very tough=20
Steeler rush defense that=01,s only allowed 2 TDs  over the last four games=
.? =20
Pittsburgh ranks # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposin=
g=20
RB and Taylor will have his hands  full.

Carolina=01,s  Tshimanga Biakubutuka vs Viking Defense?? Biakabutuka remain=
s=20
very  questionable with a bad toe and the Panthers don=01,t sound very=20
optimistic about  him playing Sunday.? Keep an eye on  it as he was able to=
=20
play through the pain last week.? Although it seems to be worse this week =
=20
than last.? If he can=01,t go, you=01,ll  see undrafted rookie FB Brad Hoov=
er get=20
the start.? Don=01,t ask me how that happens.? Minnesota is decent against =
the=20
run  ranking # 12 over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per gam=
e=20
and # 17  for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.

Tampa Bay=01,s  Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Bear Defense?? Most people=
=20
including myself  thought new offensive coordinator Les Steckel would invol=
ve=20
Mike Alstott more in  Frank Wycheck type roles.? Hasn=01,t  happened yet bu=
t it=01,
ll be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy  the balls in=20
creative ways.? I=01,m  sure his fumbling problems are still a huge concern=
 but=20
of course that=01,s not  something a guy like Tony Dungy talks very publicl=
y=20
about.? The Bears are decent against the run  ranking # 9 over the last fou=
r=20
weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for  the year, they check in at=
 #=20
21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.? =20

Denver=01,s  Terrell Davis vs Charger Defense??  Davis scared everyone this=
 week=20
when it was reported he had a problem  with his calf.? He says it=01,s =20
overblown and was calling it just =01&tightness=018 below the knee. ?He=01,=
ll need to=20
be as healthy as possible  this week as the Chargers have been playing stro=
ng=20
rush defense of late ranking  # 2 in rushing yards  allowed per game over t=
he=20
last four weeks.? For the year, they=01,re still ranked # 15  in Fantasy Po=
ints =20
allowed to the opposing RB reflecting some of their earlier  struggles.? Th=

Broncos desperately  need Davis to shoulder the load with Brian Griese out=
=20
and it=01,ll be interesting  to see how he responds.? It=01,s a  tough matc=
hup, but=20
I bet he does well.

St. Louis=01, Justin  Watson vs Redskin Defense?? The good news for Watson =
is=20
that  he doesn=01,t have to worry about Trung Canidate.? The bad news is Ro=
bert=20
Holcomb saw a  good bit of work at tailback this week and Marshall Faulk is=

even making noise  about playing Monday.? Faulk did  practice some Thursday=

but coach Mike Martz still remains pessimistic about him  seeing much actio=
n=20
this week.? Keep  an eye on it as I=01,m sure it=01,ll be a top story but r=

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These  games heavily favor the Defense?

Cleveland=01,s Travis Prentice / Jamel  White vs Titan Defense?  ?The Brown=
s=20
catch Tennessee at an awful  time as the Titans are coming off a frustratin=
g=20
loss at home to Baltimore and  will likely be looking to vent some=20
frustrations this week.? Cleveland looks to bear the brunt of  that=20
situation.? Prentice and White  have been unexceptional lately and I don=01=
,t=20
see them improving against a tough  Titan Defense.? Over the last four =20
weeks, Tennessee ranks # 7 in rushing yards allowed per game.? They also ra=
nk=20
# 7 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  These guy=
s=20
may do in a pinch on other weeks but I don=01,t see it this  Sunday.?

Detroit=01,s James Stewart vs Giant  Defense?? Stewart is still a starter i=
n=20
many  leagues but I don=01,t like his matchup here.?  (Although you can=01,=
t=20
discount the time he ran wild on Tampa Bay with an  awful matchup too)? The=
=20
Giants rank  # 1 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.=
?=20
For the last four weeks, they rank # 6  in rushing yards allowed per game.?=
 =20
That=01,s strong.? Having a  healthy Jason Sehorn back will help the entire=
=20
defense as it allows more safety  help to commit to the run.?

Oakland=01,s Napoleon Kaufman vs Saints  Defense?? Keep an eye on it, but a=
t=20
this  point Tyrone Wheatley is looking very questionable with not one but t=
wo=20
bad  ankle sprains.? His most recent  sprain is thought to be worse than th=
e=20
first sprain on the other ankle that was  limiting him already.? Kaufman =
=20
struggles a bit as the sole RB and Saints are RB Killers.? For the year, th=
ey=20
rank # 4 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last fo=
ur=20
games, they check in at  # 5 in rushing yards allowed per game.?  One ray o=
f=20
hope for Oakland is that DT Norman Hand is questionable with  bone chips in=
=20
his ankle although they believe he can play even though he hasn=01,t  pract=
iced=20
this week.?

Kansas  City=01,s RB committee vs Bills Defense??  By now you probably know=
=20
better than to risk starting any RB wearing a  Chief uniform.? This week=01=
,s a=20
good  week to follow that rule as the Bills are playing excellent rush=20
defense.? They rank # 4 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed =
=20
per game and the rate # 5 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the =20
opposing RB.? I shy  away from Chief RBs against any team but especially a=
=20
defense this tough.? If you don=01,t have any choice, Kimble  Anders will g=
et=20
the =01&start=018 but expect to see plenty of Tony Richardson and  Frank Mo=
reau.?=20
Richardson in  particular does a nice job receiving the ball.?

Dallas=01,  Emmitt Smith vs Raven Defense?? Let=01,s put it this way:? Smit=
h was=20
shut down by Cincinnati last  week.? And the Ravens are a just a  tad bit=
=20
better than the Bengals when it comes to run defense.? If anyone can bounce=
=20
back, it=01,s Smith  but last Sunday was very worrisome.?  The Ravens are f=
lying=20
high after a huge road win at Tennessee.? He=01,s still a solid RB but Smit=
h=20
will  have his hands more than full Sunday.?  The Ravens rank # 3 in rushin=
g=20
yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and for the year they rate=
 #=20
2  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.?

New York  Jets=01, Curtis Martin vs Dolphin Defense? I don=01,t  see a repe=
at of=20
the week 8 meltdown from Miami on defense.? Martin will have a tough day=20
ahead of  him against the Dolphin defense that ranks # 10 over the last fou=
r=20
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? Over the  season, they rank # 8=
=20
in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? The Dolphins were hopeful L=
B=20
Zach Thomas  could return but that=01,s not looking too likely now.? It=01,=
ll be=20
even tougher for Martin if he  does.?

New Orleans  Jerald Moore / Chad Morton vs Raider Defense??  New Orleans=20
catches a tough break as the new RBs are forced to make their  first start=
=20
facing the # 1 rush defense in rushing yards allowed per  game over the las=
t=20
four weeks.? For the year, they=01,re not quite as tough  ranking # 12 in=
=20
Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.? It=01,s tough to call right no=
w how=20
the  carries will be distributed as the Saints are understandably being=20
tight  lipped.? I expect Moore to carry  most of the load to begin with.? =
=20
He=01,s the more physical back and much more like Williams than is Morton  =
who=20
falls closer to the scat back / 3rd down guy mold.? I can envision somethin=
g=20
similar to the  rotation New England is using with J.R. Redmond and Kevin=
=20
Faulk.? For FF purposes, you=01,d of course like to  see one guy take over =
but I=20
don=01,t see that now.? The other wild card is newly signed  Terry Allen wh=
