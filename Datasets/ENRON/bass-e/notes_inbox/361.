Breaking news:

Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis has just rejected a
court petition by Vice President Al Gore to force Florida to
accept hand recounted votes.  This ruling clears the way for
the Florida Division of Elections to certify the final vote
tally tomorrow.

That's great news -- but the post-election battle is not over
yet.

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on at this very
minute in Palm Beach and Broward counties.  If the ruling by
Judge Lewis stands, Florida's Division of Elections can
throw out these "hand counts."  But the Gore legal team is
appealing the decision today and it's very likely that the
Florida Supreme Court will be hearing the case shortly.

The Florida Supreme Court is comprised of six Democrats and
1 independent, and they've already ruled in Gore's favor to
allow the "hand counting" of ballots earlier this week.

Yes, this situation is still a mess.   That's why it's still
important for us to be mobilizing in favor of fair election
practices and integrity in the ballot counting process.  The
votes were counted on election day -- and George W. Bush won
Florida.  The votes were recounted in the days that followed
-- and George W. Bush won Florida.

Now the Democrats have hand picked a couple of counties
where they think they can manufacture enough votes to make
up the difference through "hand counting" of ballots.
What's worse is they're using ballot examining techniques
that amount to mind reading to determine whether or not
voters meant to vote for Al Gore.

Thank you for signing your Petition to block these
objectionable "hand counts" and Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  Every day we pick up more supporters (we're
closing in on 200,0000!) and every day we pick up more media
recognition as we swamp Florida with your Petitions.

Here's the bottom line: we are not going to let Al Gore
steal this election.   Send anyone and everyone who might be
interested in fighting for the integrity of this election to
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com to sign our petition
and see breaking news on the action in Florida right now.

Thanks,
