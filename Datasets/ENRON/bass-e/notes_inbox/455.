??TravelTips 
?
Where's My Luggage?
?

I always make my nametag on my suitcase more noticeable by using  bright 
colored paper, ribbon or tape that way I can pick it out  quicker on a 
turnstile and hopefully others will realize it isn't  theirs. -Mary M-H

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!
