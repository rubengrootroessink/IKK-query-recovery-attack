Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is still
hurting a tad with thumb and rib injuries.  He is listed as probable
on the injury report.  His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a
shoulder injury.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the
season.

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making excellent progress, but he will likely
miss again this week.  Shane Matthews is expected to get the start
this week.  Cade is listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.  He
would probably play if Matthews were to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter despite
a sore knee.  He practiced on Wednesday.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses his
ribs.  The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will
look to Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.  Either
way, look for Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.

QB Clint Stoerner was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return the last week of the NFL
season at the earliest.  Gus Frerotte will start in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and is expected
to take the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable
whether he will start.  The coaching staff has yet to name a
starter.  I rate his chances at 85% to start.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks
like he will start this Sunday.  He is listed as questionable on the
injury report with a sore shoulder and neck.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.  He appears as
questionable on the injury report again with a  sore thumb and a
bruised ego.  He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays
hurt.  If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100%
knee) to take the field.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar
play.   He starts again this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to
start.

QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more
than that to keep him off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a
more durable body.  He appears on the injured list again as
questionable with a sore knee.  Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,
will start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock
Huard.  Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just
released from the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in
practice.  He will start this week.  Trent Green will back him up.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against
the Cowboys.  Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this
week.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt
thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George
watches.  I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running backs in the News:

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and
is questionable for this week's game.  He is having trouble
making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He
is listed as probable with a sore toe.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.  Look for
Travis Prentice to "shoulder" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start
this week.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.  Mike
Anderson gets the start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.  Ahman Green will get
the start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report
with a tender hamstring.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with
bruised ribs, but he expects to play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.  He may now
be ready for the last game of the regular season.  His cast is
expected to come off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore neck.  He is still expected to start though, but Chad
Morton may see a few more reps than usual.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.  He is
listed as probable with a sore gluteous.  I am guessing he is the
butt of many New York jokes.

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger,
but his ankles are better.  He will play this week.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using
the time to look for personalized items with his last name.  We will
keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.
On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande
and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the
inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play
with the pain.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway.  The team
remains cautious in his comeback.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week.  Look for Warrick Dunn
to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects
to practice today and play this weekend.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm.  Look for the
Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to
play with a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he
injured in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore
knee.  He did not practice on Wednesday.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.  Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than
Yancey Thigpen=01(=01(=01(well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy
either.
Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as
questionable on the injury report.  He says he will be ready to play
though.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe.  With Tony
Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal
for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore leg, but he expects to play.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the
injury report.  Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough
to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius
will start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out
with a twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee,
but even if he played he would likely be ineffective.  Hines Ward has
been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all
year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking
like he will be on the field though.  He was quoted in the Sacramento
Bee as saying he is 85% right now.  I am guessing he is closer to
70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his
turf toe.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this
week.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.
Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his
condition.  He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to
whether he plays.  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar
so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play
this week.

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play
with a sore knee.

TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee.  Fantasy players are
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps.
He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this
weekend.  He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as
questionable on the injury report with a sore knee.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass
last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.  If Grbac plays, expect
him to get the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to
play.

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.  John Davis still gets
a lot of looks though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.  But he has
looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall
minutes before game-time.  Now that the Rams are tied for first
though, expect the players to start working through the pain.  I rate
Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.
