Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.?=20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week11sheet.htm=
 =20
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just becau=

one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

Kansas City  Passing Game vs 49er Defense??  Virtually every  skill positio=

QB Elvis  Grbacthrew for more  yards than Randall Cunningham, Akili Smith,=
=20
Doug Pederson and Kordell Stewart  combined.? San Francisco can=01,t stop =
=20
anyone and I don=01,t envision them learning how this week.? San Francisco=
=20
allows more Fantasy Points  to the opposing QB than any other team in the=

league. The KC RBs are a mess and  coach Gunther Cunningham says they won=

Denver Passing  Game vs Raider Defense??  For the year, the  Raiders have=

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Seahawk Defense?? It wasn=01,t supposed to pl=

out  this way for Seattle but as we enter week 11 of the season, the Seahaw=
ks=20
find  themselves floundering.? Not only  are they having trouble scoring=20
points, their defense is giving up entirely too  many points.? CB Shawn=20

league.? They  rank 18th in the league when it comes to Fantasy Points=20

faith yet.?  TE  Kyle Bradyis suddenly the  Jacksonville Secret Weapon and =

This year the Saints are the once awful  team that=01,s playing inspired=20
football.?  ThePanther defense has allowed an average of 261 passing yards=

catching 4 passes.? I=01,m cheering for him but I don=01,t expect  Garrison=

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Jets Defense??? Whether you want to lay it  o=
n=20
the opponents or not, it=01,s hard to deny the Jets defense has slipped =20
lately.? For the year, they rank #  13 in Fantasy Points allowed to the=20

 261=20
passing yards per game which puts them at #  26.? They=01,ve given up 11 to=

he could have been even better.? I like the way he=01,s rallying the team  =

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

New York Giants Passing Game vs. Rams  Defense?? Two very good teams going =
in=20
slightly different  directions.? The Rams are dealing with adversity losing=
=20
their two best  players while the Giants are regaining some of their early=
=20
season steam.  Rejuvenated QB Kerry Collins will face a St. Louis defense =
=20
that's still yielding lots of passing yards.? In fact, they rank # 25 in =
=20
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? They rank # 23 in=
 =20
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs for the year.? WR Amani  Toomer's=20

on fire lately.? Ike Hilliard is a fine # 2  WR as well.? RBs Tiki Barber a=

Ron Dayne  provide a solid running threat and TE Pete Mitchell  should=20
contribute more than he has been.=20


St. Louis Passing Game vs  Giant Defense?? New York is a good team and it's=
 a=20
pretty  tough matchup against the Giants.? New York ranks # 16 in Fantasy=
=20
Points  allowed to opposing QBs this year.? And they rank # 4 in passing=20
yards  allowed over the last four weeks.? Plus they'll be getting CB Jason=
=20
Sehorn  back this week it appears.? QB Trent Green has done an  admirable j=
ob=20
filling in for Kurt Warner.? I'm betting he'll continue that  success here.=
?=20
Isaac Bruce is the # 1 WR,?and he'll  bring Az-zahir Hakim and Torry Holt=
=20
into the  fold as well.? All are viable starters.? TE Roland Williams  is a=
=20
decent play but he's inconsistent.? Throw in the fact they'll  likely be=20
throwing a lot without Marshall Faulk and I think they'll do  well.

Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Packer Defense??  Green Bay may have salvaged the=
ir=20
season with Antonio Freeman's  spectacular catch Monday night but they stil=
l=20
have a pass defense that gives up  too many yards.? For the year, they rank=
 #=20
24 in Fantasy Points allowed to  opposing QBs and over the last four weeks,=
=20
they've allowed 242 passing yards per  game which also ranks them # 24.?=20
Shaun King continues to  post nice numbers even if they're not real pretty.=
?=20
Over his last three  games, he's thrown 7 TDs but has only rolled up 526=20
yards.? Still, that  ranks him # 12 among QBs.? He's been diagnosed with=20
Tonsillitis?as of  Thursday after complaining of fatigue.??He's expected to=
=20
play but  watch it. Of course, his favorite WR is now Keyshawn Johnson  aft=
er=20
Keyshawn's private meeting at King's house a couple of weeks  ago.? They're=
=20
winning with getting the ball to Johnson so don't look for  that to change.=
?=20
Jacquez Green is a solid WR and the  better deep threat.? TE Dave Moore has=
=20
been more active  catching a TD last week.
?
New York Jets Passing Game vs Colt  Defense??? Owners of Chicago's Jim Mill=
er=20
like to think  it was all Miller last week as he ripped through the Colt=20
secondary.?  Truthfully, the Colt's porous pass defense had plenty to do wi=
th=20
it.?  Vinny Testeverde should have similar success.? The Colts  rank # 18 i=
n=20
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. But that  includes=
=20
giving up a decent amount of yardage to less than juggernauts Chicago, =20
Detroit, New England and Seattle.? WRs Wayne Chrebet and  rookie sensation=
=20
Laveranues Coles should do well.?  TE Anthony Becht is finally starting to=
=20
fulfill  expectations.? He's probable on the injury report with a knee inju=
ry=20
but  should be able to play.
?

Buffalo Passing Game vs Bear Defense??  The Bears have played decent pass=
=20
defense of late ranking # 17 in  passing yards allowed over the last four=
=20
weeks.? Peyton Manning rolled up  302 yards against them last week and ther=
e=20
were several badly dropped  passes.? The Bills will reportedly start Doug =

Flutie.? He's a foot shorter than Manning but brings scrambling  ability th=
e=20
Bears may have a tough time with.? TE Jay Reimersma  is back to the focal=

point we all thought he'd be and that should  continue.? Eric Moulds is the=

prime threat at WR with  Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel rounding  out t=
he=20
WRs.? I'd think Reimersma and Moulds will get the bulk of the work  though.

?

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way

Chicago Passing Game vs Bills Defense?? If I'm  Cade McNown, I'm starting t=
o=20
get very worried.? New QB Jim Miller  looked very good Sunday as he went 24=
=20
for 35 with 214 yards, 1 TD and 0  interceptions.? That's a great start.?=
=20
He'll have a tough go of it  this week there could be enough hoopla=20
surrounding the Buffalo QBs that Chicago  can sneak in.? The Bills are rank=
ed=20
# 19 in passing yards allowed per game  over the last four weeks.? Miller's=
=20
main target will again be WR  Marcus Robinson.? He's big enough to match up=
=20
well with  the Bills CBs.? After Harrison, it gets hard to predict with Edd=
ie=20
 Kennison and Marty Booker catching plenty of  balls.? TE Kassem Sinceno=20
becomes a little more involved  each week.? I keep looking for him to make=
=20
that big catch.
?
Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Defense?? The  Raider attack is firing on al=
l=20
cylinders here.? Denver ranks # 8 in passing  yards allowed over the last=
=20
four weeks.? They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points  allowed to opposing QBs for=
=20
the year.? In their week 3 matchup, QB  Rich Gannon threw 2 TDs but had his=
=20
lowest yardage total of the year  (159) and had 2 interceptions.? They've=
=20
improved since then.?  WR Tim Brown is the primary guy of course but both =

Andre Rison and James Jett may make  plays.? I'm not totally into the Rison=

hype as he's not getting tons of  looks.? Although he is making the very mo=

of what he's getting.?  TE Ricky Dudley awoke from his slumber with a=20
vengeance.?  He's so frustrating but he's too talented in too good a=20
situation not to play  unless you have another great TE.
?
Dallas Passing Game vs Bengal Defense??  The Bengals rank # 20 in passing=

yards allowed over the last four  weeks.? They're # 14 in Fantasy Points=20

QB Troy Aikman  took the needle again this week with more cortisone shots f=

North Dallas 40 each week?? The WRs are hardly recognizable with  James=20
McNight, Wayne McGarity and Jason Tucker  carrying the load. I'm not real=

excited about any of them.?  TE Jackie Harris could be the focal point for=
=20
the passing  game.

New England Passing Game vs Brown Defense?? Keep  an eye on this one as muc=
h=20
depends on Drew Bledsoe's right  thumb.? He's still listed as questionable=
=20
but we'll know more Friday and  Saturday.? Assuming he's ok, this is still =
a=20
tough matchup.? If  Bledsoe sits and John Friesz starts, this probably slid=
es=20
to a  "downside" matchup. The Browns rank? # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed to=
 =20
opposing QBs.? And they rank # 9 in passing yards allowed per game over the=
 =20
last four weeks.? WR Terry Glenn's struggled some of late  but this could b=

a game he takes advantage of the Cleveland secondary.?  Troy Brown is seein=

some passes as well.? The Patriots  haven't thrown to the TE since Ben Coat=

left town.
?
Minnesota Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Suddenly, the Vikings and=20
Daunte Culpepper are  human.? Coach Denny Green says Culpepper's been limit=
ed=20
by a sore tailbone  and knee that's hindering his mobility.? This week they=
,=20
face an Arizona  defense that ranks # 13 in passing yards allowed per game=
=20
over the last four  weeks.? They also face new coach Dave McGinnis, a guy=
=20
with a reputation for  designing defenses to confuse young QBs. They rank #=
=20
10 for the year in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing QBs.? Some of that i=
s=20
no doubt a reflection on  their weak rushing defense but the cause really=
=20
isn't important.? Culpepper  will be throwing to the usual culprits of Rand=
y=20
Moss and  Cris Carter.? Aeneas Williams is fine corner but he can't  cover=
=20
everyone. Both Moss and Carter are must starts, as is Culpepper.?  They've=

to allowing Batch to get into a rhythm.

Green Bay Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense??  Both teams seem to have foun=

limit the other from being a  major factor.

Carolina Passing Game vs Saints Defense?? The  turnaround of the Saints is=

one of the best stories of the season.?  Certainly, their tough defense=20
deserves much credit.? Against the pass, New  Orleans ranks just # 16 in=20
passing yards allowed over the last four games.?  They're much tougher=20
