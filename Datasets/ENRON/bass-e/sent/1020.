>Below is a true story that was in the local newspaper about a recent
>wedding that took place at Clemson University,South Carolina.
>
>Even Jay Leno mentioned it:
>
>This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.  After the wedding,
>at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk
>to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many
>from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted
>to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new
>father-in-law for providing such a fabulous
>reception. To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and
>everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just
>him.  So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope,
>including the wedding party.  He said that this was his gift to everyone,
>and told everyone to open the envelopes. Inside each manila envelope was an
>8 x 10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride.  He had gotten
>suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them
>weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's
>reactions for a couple of  minutes, he turned to the best man and said
>"F--- you", he turned to the bride and said "F--- you", and then he turned
>to the dumb founded
>crowd and said "I'm out of here." He had the marriage annulled first thing
>that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement
>immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with
>it anyway as if nothing was wrong. His revenge:   Making the bride's
>parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception.  Letting
>everyone know exactly what did happen. And best of all, trashing the
>bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends, their
>entire families,
>i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and
>nephews, etc. Yes, revenge when applied properly, like this way, can
>be sweet eh?
