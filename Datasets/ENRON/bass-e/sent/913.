I hope you were only thinking good things!  
I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended family in Fairfield.  
Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?  They have the cutest 
kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time with them.  I had fun at 
your birthday party!  When do I get to take you to PF's for lunch?

Yes I did.  I was just thinking about you.  I'm really glad you showed up.
I'm also sorry to hear about your grandma.  I will keep her in my prayers.
I had a fun and relaxing weekend, and I'm really glad you were a part of it
:-).  Did you have fun?
