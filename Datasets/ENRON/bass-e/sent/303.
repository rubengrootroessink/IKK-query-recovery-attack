For Stephen Davis and Marcus Robinson, I will give you Taylor and George.

You are going to say no to this and I know this, but in 2-3 weeks we will
revisit the offer.

Let me quote from another source how I feel about trading Taylor.

"Let me get this right: You've waited three weeks for Taylor to get
healthy,
perhaps costing you a win or two, and now you want to trade him? No. Even
if
you think Taylor's going to get hurt again this year (that's a fairly safe
assumption), this is not the time to trade him. Get him in the lineup this
week and keep him there for a couple of weeks. Then, once his value has
maxed out again, that's the time to consider trading him. By that point,
you'll be offered a whole lot more than Anderson and Dudley."

Now, this does not mean I am unwilling to trade or barter, but I will treat
Taylor as the top 5 running back that he is and I will value him as such.
If that is an arena you want to trade in let me know and I will see what we
might be able to do.
