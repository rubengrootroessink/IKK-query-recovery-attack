I love how I am included on the risk outing e-mail distribution list.  I mean 
why would I need to take a job in your department when I get e-mails about 
all the events anyway?

Yes, we have finally suckered some other Enron group into taking on Bryan 
Hull.  Just teasin', Bryan's last day with the Risk Team will be this Friday, 
June 2nd.  It wouldn't be right if we didn't send him off without his well 
deserved roasting.

This Thursday evening at 5:30 we will gather at Teala's on W. Dallas to bid 
Bryan farewell.

For future reference, Bryan will be joining the EOL group on the 26th floor 
on Monday, June 5th.  His extension will be the same so feel free to continue 
to harass him. 

See ya there! 

If, in haste, we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the 
invite on.

Thanx!
Yvette
