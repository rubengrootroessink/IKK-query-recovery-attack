Hey Brett,

Not too much going on in H-town.  I just recently started trading Natural Gas 
Futures.  I have had three heart attacks, a stroke, and have bitten off all 
of my fingers in a week.  Other than that things are going pretty well.

I should be in town for easter, so if you want to get together, lemme know.

How is artillery school going?

out
