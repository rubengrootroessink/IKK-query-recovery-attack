Also,  I have been meaning to talk to you.  We agreed to terms on the TV,
but I wanted to ask something Aaron's rents gave me a 4 day Window to pay
between the 18th and 22nd and as you know at this moment in time I am living
paycheck to paycheck.  I am going to have a much higher paying job within
the next month but for now I am asking that you too can give me that Window.
For instance, my next check comes on the 20th and If I am due on the 18th ,
I will be late.

I am going to pass on the current offer.  I want to hold on to Taylor.  I
don't think Garner will be worth a shit.  Now if you would want to do
Watters for Robinson straight up, I would do that.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know
