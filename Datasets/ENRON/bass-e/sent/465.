engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i 
might add) for a backup WR.  

the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have 
a pretty good year.

by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.

so don't give me any of that

Ramiro believes Engram is going to have a very good year.  He needs a
Running Back.  I don't think he is being ridiculous.  Engram may be ranked
30th now, but you obviously believe he is a little better than that or you
wouldn't want him so bad.

your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th
