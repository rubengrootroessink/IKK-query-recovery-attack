>We finally get back to his place and I'm wondering if he's going to dump

>Reluctantly, I say I'm going to go to sleep. Then, after about 10
>minutes or so, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seems really,
>really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave. I roll over and
>sniffle a little real quietly. He snores. I dunno, I just don't know,
>what he thinks anymore. I mean, do you think he's met someone else?
