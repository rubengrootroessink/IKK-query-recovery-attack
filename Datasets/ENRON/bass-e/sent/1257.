ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT 
   A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing
him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a
Great Falls, Mont., courtroom.
   Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a
career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million
dollars bond.
   Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners
cooked for friends and neighbors "little boy stews."
   He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder and
several other charges, including impersonating a police officer.
