Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is
attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board
off of a nearby fence, wedges it down
the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving
his friend's life.

A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over
to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL"
he starts writing in his notebook.

"But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies.
"Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed
you were."

The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND
FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."

The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."

"Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an
Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."

The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."

The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."

"Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you
root for?" the reporter asked.

"Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.

The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS
KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."
