Subject: Analyst Program Survey - Response Requested


In an effort to better serve the Analyst pool here at Enron, the Analyst 
Program recently
formed the Analyst Advisory Board.  The charter member of the AA Board are:
Carrie Southhard, Alejandro Hernandez, Julie Davidson, Erin Rice, Brian 
Hoskins and David Hunker.

So that we may understand the issues that are important to you, the Analyst 
pool, we have
prepared a short survey.  Your opinion is very important to us as it will 
guide our
future endeavours.  We strive to make this a better program and your 
participation is vital
to our success. Please click the link below to be taken directly to the 
survey form.
