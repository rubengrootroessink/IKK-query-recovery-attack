I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate 
this), Applewhite should play.  I think if Applewhite plays and we have a 
decent running game, we can blow them out.  Our defense is good enough to 
shut pretty much anyone down.

When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there?

I'm there.  What do you think about OU??  I think it will be a tough game but 
I sure am glad (make that hope) that Hodges doesn't see the field too much.
