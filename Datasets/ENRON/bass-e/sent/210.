Eric -  
We cannot delete meter #3537 from this particular Product Description since 
Products using this product location have already been transacted on 
(including Transaction #33491).   

Therefore, we will need to either create a new location name (what would be 
the "new" location name?) or we can advise the customers via a ticker  
message that the Product description for "HPL/AguaD" has been revised.    
Unfortunately, we are working through some issues with the ticker message 
system, but we have been advised that it will be in place soon.  Are you able 
to postpone until the ticker system is operable?

Please advise.

The applicable product numbers are 33462, 33464, 33491, and 33492.
