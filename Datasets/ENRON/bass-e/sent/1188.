Hi Eric,

2405 Mandell looks really good.  HCAD app. $267500.
2401 Mandell sold on 8/29/00 for $279900 in 6 days.  These are Silvestri
townhomes which I think are a cut above Perry.  HCAD for 2402 (Perry) is
$271800, not much less than asking price.  This is a patio home.  How many
townhomes/patio homes would you estimate are on the street?  Do you want to
try to see 2405 also?  LU-M
