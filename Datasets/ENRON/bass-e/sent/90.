anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=

discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20

WHAT=01,S HAPPENING

SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was th=
e=20
case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=
=20
fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to=
=20
dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter=01,s absolute embarrassment!) How=
ever,=20
the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever=
.=20
The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no=
=20
less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That=01,s all for this letter. Hope you=01,re planning your trip to Telluri=
de,=20
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on=
=20
the slopes!

years ago. But after a few turns, she fell =01( in love with the sport. She=
