Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an 
HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the 
deal more economical.

Bass, is this accurate?

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. Eric tells Mick how much expense Tom is including in his P&L for this 
transportation, and Mick includes it in Ed's P&L as revenue from the 
Marketing   Desk.
7. Phillip does manual G/L entries to show an expense to Tom and a revenue to 
Ed for the same amount .
8. This revenue shows up en masse with all of the other revenue from the 
marketing desk in Ed's P&L.

The total revenue for Ed for this portion is about $6,000 per month.  Eric 
says, too, that Ed shows revenue during the winter months for transport for 
Entex of about $200,000 per month from the marketing desk.  This comes from 
money reserved to manage the Entex deal.
