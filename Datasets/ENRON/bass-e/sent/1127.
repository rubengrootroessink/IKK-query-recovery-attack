Hey Dad,
Unfortunately, Vegas kicked my butt, but I had fun.  I would love to go to 
Uncle George's B-day party.  Are guests invited as well b/c Shanna would like 
to go.
I heard you had fun with the sister this weekend - what did you do?

Good afternoon. Welcome home. Heard from your  Mother that they took some of 
your money. That's too bad. I have never let them  take my money! By the way, 
Uncle George is having an 80th birthday party this  Sat., Feb. 24, @ 5p.m. @ 
Luther's BBQ, 27752 I-45 N.,, across from the Woodlands  Mall. We are going. 
You are invited. If you intend to go you should RSVP to Vera  @ 281-379-5252 
or Rebecca @ 281-367-8470. Have a good  week.-Dad
