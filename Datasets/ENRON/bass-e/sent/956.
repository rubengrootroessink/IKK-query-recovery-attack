We have actually already called Springer to get on his "Surprise, I'm dating 
your brother" episode.  It's a pretty good deal b/c you get an all expense 
paid trip to Chicago for the weekend.  

I am actually a multimillionare now - I'm thinking about buying that new 
car.  Do you want one?
There is not much going on this weekend on my end - I will probably take it 
easy.  And you?  Let me guess - you are going to try and stop by my place 
(that will happen)?

Is this the girl that likes you?  I see a possible Springer  episode! :-)  I
just got back from lunch and I'm feeling a little sick still.  I think half
of the office is out sick.  Too bad I don't own any part of the Big E!  I
guess you just made a million dollars than?  Time to sell, buy low, sell
high, huh?  What's going on this weekend?

  He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He
is going to wait it
  out another month to see if a new position comes available.
If not, he is
  applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and
Colorado.  I think he
  took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night
so I am waiting to
  hear about that.

  By the way, have you seen Enron's stock the last two days.
It has gone from 53
  to 72.  It 's good to work for the big E!

            I had a really fun time.  There were probably
about 10
  people from work there
            and my bro.  We stayed out until about 1:30 and
then went
  home.

            I'm going to start calling you "backout" if you
don't shape
  up.
