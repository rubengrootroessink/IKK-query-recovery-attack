Hey Greg,

I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
good books.  Check the AIMR website.

Bass,

Long time, no talk.  How's it going?  Hope the market is treating you well!

I have a question for you.  I am looking to take the CFA Level I test this 
summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
studied.  If so, who produced it.

I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.


I would really appreciate it.

Late,
GM
