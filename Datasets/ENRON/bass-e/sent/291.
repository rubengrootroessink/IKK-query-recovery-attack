I ordered your mom a present yesterday.  It should get here before her 
birthday- I would think- because they said it was in stock.  Anyway- I didn't 
know if you had her anything yet or not- but your welcome to give it to her 
if you want-  I just read about it- and thought it would be something that 
she would enjoy- and that you might enjoy giving to her.   But- like I said- 
I ordered it on-line- so I haven't been able to examine it in person- but 
sounded really neat.

Shanna
