Are you ready for some football!?!?!

I am trying to put together a flag football game this Sunday at 2:30 pm at 
Rice University.  I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many 
friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag 
football.  If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone 
number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have 
any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure 
Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; 
I'll bring the football).

The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. 
stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice 
University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and 
bleachers.  It's hard to miss!

I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, 
unathletic ass anyway...

My contact info is 713-345-7594.
