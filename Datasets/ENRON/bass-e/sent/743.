Thanks for the information.  We are using it to try to get a sense of the 
increase in demand created by this new generation.  I have cross referenced 
some of your info with some info from the power desk.  this info is 
attached.  In addition, it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you 
mentioned below.  Please let me know when you can send the maps.


Thanks,

Eric

Here is the information that I have compiled about new IPPs in Texas.  What 
exactly are you using this for? I also have ArcView maps of the majority of 
all the plant locations with surrounding pipelines. If you have any 
information about new IPPs that I do not have I will be very interested.
