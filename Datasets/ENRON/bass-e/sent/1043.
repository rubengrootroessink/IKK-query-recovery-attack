Brett,

Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare 
time on your hands.  
Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading 
gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times 
(lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like 
you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.  
Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to 
Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  

Where are you currently stationed? 

Drop me a line next time you come to houston?

-out

Hey y'all,

Got bored, made a homepage, lemme know what you think.

address is:  http://lawlerspage.homestead.com/

I'm not sure but I think if I edit or add stuff to the page you have to
re-enter the address if u had it bookmarked so I reckon if u bookmark it and
it don't work it's cause I added some stuff.  Either that or it was just a
freak one time thing (I tried to use my bookmark today and it no workie).

Lawler, OUT.
