=09
=09After listening to Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops' news conference on Tuesday=
,=20
here are some selected quotes I thought readers might find interesting.=20
=09
=09 On the season so far and how the team has changed from last year:=20
=09
=09 "We're excited about the position we're in being 4-0, and we're a confi=
dent=20
team going down to Dallas. We are more mature. We understand more. We play=
=20
harder and are better conditioned and stronger than a year ago."=20
=09
=09 On having four turnovers in last year's game with UT:=20
=09
=09 "Turnovers were a major factor. We had two interceptions that hit us ri=
ght=20
in the chest and we drop. Both of those interceptions led to scores for=20
them."=20
=09
=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20
=09
=09 "I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=
 same=20
offense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =
a=20
good part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=
=20
he'll be in there the whole go unless something happens."=20
=09
=09 On OU's running game:=20
=09
=09 "I hope our running game is a factor in this game. We're quite a bit mo=
re=20
confident in our running game because we've emphasized it."=20
=09
=09 On going up, 17-0, in the first quarter and then losing last year's gam=
e,=20
38-28:=20
=09
=09 "We set the tone early last year and didn't finish the tone. There's no=
=20
protecting a lead for three quarters. And Major Applewhite made some throws=
,=20
you watch on film, that you can't believe."=20
=09
=09 On OU having lost three straight to Texas:=20
=09
=09 "We get e-mails and letters. We know what the situation is, and we need=
 to=20
win." =20
=09
=09
=09
=09=20
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: I heard rumors that the Royal-Memorial Stadium will one day be the =
=20
largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country, seating some =
=20
114,000 folks. What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20
=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=
=20
Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=
 a=20
good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20
would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=
en=20
the focus would turn to the south end.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Kalen Thornton =20
=09
=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20
=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=
 Carl=20
Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=
=20
would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=
=20
wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20
Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20
considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=
e=20
tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=
=20
playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =
by=20
holding him out this season.=20
=09
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=
 =20
second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=
=20
about the punt team.=20
=09
=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call "fair catch=
." I=20
first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=
=20
making an early tackle by  invading the "halo" and receiving a 5-yard penal=
ty=20
is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.
=09
=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=
p the=20
receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=
=20
make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=
he=20
penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=
th=20
and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20
=09
=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=
=20
against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20
Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=
=20
5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=
ick.=20
Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=
=20
am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20
=09?? Jerry Secrets=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=
ame.=20
The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=
=20
angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=
ay=20
side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=
=20
team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=
=20
Saturday, it did.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20
=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=
till=20
seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=
e=20
and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=
gh=20
ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=
ne=20
wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=
=20
was premature.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Josh Heupel =20
=09
=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=
y can=20
answer the call? =20
=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=
s.=20
UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=
=20
possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20
D-backs.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =
keys?=20
=09?? Sara Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=
=20
Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=
er=20
picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=
as,=20
do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=
?=20
Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20
continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20
season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=
=20
gets injured.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=
te=20
has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =
It=20
has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks "starters" and insist on=20
token starts for Chris Simms.=20
=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=
 THE=20
starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=
=20
of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=
ho=20
then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =
As=20
fine as Simms' =20
=09
=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=
=20
realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=
on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=
d=20
half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20
rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20
superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=
=20
hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=
ay=20
too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20
matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=
=20
onto Stockton's pocket?=20
=09
=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=
hat=20
they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=
=20
are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=
=20
special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=
o=20
have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=
=20
said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=
as=20
the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=
=20
assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=
gh=20
the middle of the line.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=
alize=20
what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20
wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20
O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20
=09
=09Guess what? Most of these "great" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=
 a=20
freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=
th=20
current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =
or=20
two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=
=20
biggie.=20
=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some "Braveheart"-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=
=20
the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =
as=20
the perennial powers.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=
ve=20
the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=
=20
NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=
al=20
help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=
=20
guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20
=09?? Arland Bishop=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =
back=20
to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =
in=20
the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20
=09
=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =
The=20
only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=
=20
are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=
do=20
in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=
e=20
Field.=20
=09
=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=
 be=20
another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20
obviously on the horizon.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=
n=20
do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=
ing=20
to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=
.=20
If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=
=20
this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20
=09?? Mike McDonald=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=
n and=20
works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=
r=20
him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=
=20
senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=
=20
every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20
=09
=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=
=20
mindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the=
=20
football team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=
s,=20
for the most part, are good kids.=20
=09
=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=
tive=20
voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=
.=20
If he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on=
=20
criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20
alternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac=
k. I=20
know he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo=
l.=20
I saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. =
I=20
was thinking he should be a senior this year. Do you know what ever happene=
d=20
to him?=20
=09?? Jeff, Marshall, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Aaron is just running track this year. He has left the football=
=20
team.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up=
? It=20
just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20
=09?? Mark V.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=
=20
practices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks=
=20
worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=
m=20
practiced on it last year, too).=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=
 have=20
been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=
=20
game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=
=20
the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=
=20
school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football=
=20
game.
=09
=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=
tting=20
drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=
=20
like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20
something negative to heap on the program.
=09
=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =
his=20
coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=
h=20
the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=
=20
about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=
=20
you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20
=09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=
ing=20
up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20
storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=
oo=20
big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=
o=20
burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20
re-evaluated and said, "Wait, they really aren't that good."
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20
star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=
t=20
to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =
in=20
the foundation to bring up.=20
=09
=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=
e and=20
then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=
=20
bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20
itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09
=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=
=20
believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=
as=20
may get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi=
ll=20
have been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=
is=20
team. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll=

see how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20
here. =20

=09
=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =
I=20
realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20
option, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=
ed=20
from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20
system. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=
=20
for your insightful newsletter. =20
=09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =
they=20
are Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=
r=20
Simms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20
coaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20
benefited from his redshirt season.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of=
=20
fair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20
=09
=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=
em=20
with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=
=20
Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20
coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =
of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=
=20
both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=
=20
but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20
country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=
he=20
offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=
=20
time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=
=20
this line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=
=20
work with these guys.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T=
exas=20
(a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played =
in=20
the Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u=
p=20
the lost revenue that would result from a Robertson Stadium game, even if=
=20
they do put in an extra 10,000 temporary seats?=20
=09?? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is a price Texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb=
lance=20
of an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, =
I=20
doubt they will actively seek to change next year's schedule. It will be an=
=20
intimate setting, shall we say.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =
not=20
let  him return some punts?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=
til=20
at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20
freshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20
progress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=
=20
to see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=
ck=20
there. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou=
ld=20
like to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20
fearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=
tart=20
shuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea=
d=20
of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=
=20
consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=
n=20
the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=
=20
and Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers=
=20
even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=
 =20
in until late in the game.=20
=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=
=20
early performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=
e=20
Applewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20
confidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20
=09?? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim=
ms=20
every chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=
ar=20
he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=
n=20
is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=
=20
rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=
w=20
only have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=
wo=20
starters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20
don't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=
ny=20
game training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20
=09
=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=
mes=20
because they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=
=20
they will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=
t=20
hope that the rotation doesn't hurt the team's offensive progress heading=
=20
into the A=02?game and post-season.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is there a start time for the Colorado game? And will it be on TV?=
=20
=09?? Marcus Phillips=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The Colorado game will be at 2:30 p.m. Central time on Oct. 14.=
 But=20
the game will NOT be on TV. Not even on pay-per-view. If you want to see th=
is=20
one, you gotta get out to Boulder.=20
