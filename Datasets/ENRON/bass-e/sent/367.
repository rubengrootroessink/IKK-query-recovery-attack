So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You 
write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

-Eric
