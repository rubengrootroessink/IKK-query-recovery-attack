Subject: Paintball Tomorrow

We are getting a group together to play paintaball tomorrow at around 10 am.  
We will be playing at Adventure Village (just north of Intercontinental 
Airport on FM 1960).  Their website is www.adventurevillage.com.  The total 
cost should be somewhere between $30-$40 per person ( about $15 for a gun and 
$6 per 100 paintballs).  Let me know if you can make it.
