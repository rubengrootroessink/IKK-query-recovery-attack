Once again, not interested.  I am willing to do a deal for Dillon and Davis.  
If you can put together a package, I am listening.  I do not like any of your 
other runningbacks and I am willing to part with McCaffrey and Faulk and any 
other receiver I have except Connell.  Or if you like Connell better, take 
McCauffrey out.
