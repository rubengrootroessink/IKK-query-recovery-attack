Please forward to your respective personnel.

There will be 2 demos of the New SITARA Risk Assignment release this Thursday 
(Jan 13) in room EB 2537 from 11:15-12:15, and 1:00-2:00.

There will be additional demos for the general SITARA population the 
following week; however, since these changes effect you the most,  I highly 
recommend you attempt to make one of the sessions this week.   We planning on 
rolling the new changes out the weekend of Jan 22.   These are some major 
changes that will effect every deal with risk assignment.

Please make every effort to attend.  

If you currently enter deals with risk assignment - hands on training can be 
arranged.  Also, we will be available to assist you as needed after 
implementation.
