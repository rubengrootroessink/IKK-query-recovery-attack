Subject: Game Tomorrow

I'm not sure what time the game is tomorrow, I think 7, but unfortunately 
ya'll will have to do w/o me.  I know it will be tough making up for my 4 pts 
and 2 reb per game, but I think you will survive.  We play Hiemstra's team, 
and he said they are terrible, so good luck.  Let me know if you will be able 
to play, and if we're short I'll try and find a sub.
