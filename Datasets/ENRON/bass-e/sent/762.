What do I look like - a key map?

Take Allen Parkway to Shepherd.  Make a right on Shepherd and a quick left on 
Memorial.  Follow Memorial all the way to the park.  I don't know which side 
you will play on b/c both sides have fields.

Hey!  What is the best way to get from work to the softball parks at 
Memorial?  Remember that my garage empties onto Andrews.
