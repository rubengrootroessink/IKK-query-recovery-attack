That looks good, but I need an index based product for July for the HPL/HSX 
Pool (not the east pool)

Thanks,

Eric

Take a look at what's in DRAFT and if it looks okay I'll activate the Product.

Lot's of manual intervention..............................

I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep 
getting an error msg for length.   Is there a way to truncate these products 
so that we can trade them on eol?  

Thanks,

Eric
