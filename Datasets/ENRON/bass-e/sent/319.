I will make reservations for dinner today. I sent Dad the info on
restaurants yesterday but I forgot to ask him which one to reserve.  There
is one near the hotel -Brio Vista - and two downtown - Jeffrey's and Louis
106.  I'll talk to him and get back with you.  Dinner Friday night, correct.
Are we on our own Saturday?  LU-M
