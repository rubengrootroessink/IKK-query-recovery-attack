I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning 
of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most 
overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any 
time Texas is challenged they "you-know-what" their pants.

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!
