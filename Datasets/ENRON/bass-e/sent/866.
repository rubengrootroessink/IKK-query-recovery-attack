If you want me to take care of her, let me know.  I'm not scared of her

OK- you don't think that the roommate is a little bit touchy about the time 
that you and I have been spending together?!?!?  See what I have to deal 
with.  Knowing full and well that when she was dating Chad- I literally went 
6 days without seeing her.

outside of work with him.
