Mike,

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an 
excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting 
to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected 
volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of 
whether we have any missing data.  

Thanks

James
