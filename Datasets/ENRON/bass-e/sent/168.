I don't remember being part of this vote.  And who says that this is a 
democracy?

I don't remember the vote turning out that way.

A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.  I then went around to 
everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in 
everyone's pocket.  If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince 
them, let me know.  By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?  DO 
I have to wait until the end of the season.
