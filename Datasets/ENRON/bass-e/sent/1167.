Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game.  
LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never 
began.  




Mississippi 50, LSU 33
		
 
OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi 
to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. 
Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 
Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one 
year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. 
Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), 
which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss 
at Rice in 1948. 
The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced 
them into 25 turnovers. 
LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the 
Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. 
LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 
run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to 
highlight the surge. 
The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 
remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole 
Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked 
the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. 
LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an 
offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. 
Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 
3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.
