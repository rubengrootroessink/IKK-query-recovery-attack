Ladies & Gentlemen,

The BCS may have screwed up the match ups but that won't stop the annual 
College Bowl Pool from taking place.  The attached spreadsheet contains the 
rules and a pick sheet.  For the veterans the rules are the same as last 
year.  The entry fee is $25.  Money and picks are due Monday December 18th.  
Feel free to forward this to anyone that may be interested in participating.  

Cris
