Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  Enron once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team Enron once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, Enron 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian
