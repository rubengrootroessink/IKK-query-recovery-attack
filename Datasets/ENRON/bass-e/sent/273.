Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he 
gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, 
so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a 
place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.

Do you want to go?
