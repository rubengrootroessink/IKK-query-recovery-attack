Subject: Austin?

I know that Christa sent an e-mail about this a couple of weeks ago, but I 
wanted to follow up.  Does anyone have any interest in going to Austin Friday 
night and then going tubing in New Braunfels on Saturday.  

Let me know. Forward this to anyone you think mught be interested.
