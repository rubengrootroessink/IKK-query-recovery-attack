Hi Eric,

Dad suggested that we meet at the hotel on Friday and stop at Katy Mills on
the way home on Sunday.  What do you think?  Let me know what time you
expect to arrive in Austin.  You will probably get there before us so just
leave a message at the desk or call us on the car phone.  Have a great day.
We look foward to spending the weekend with you and Shanna.  LU-M
