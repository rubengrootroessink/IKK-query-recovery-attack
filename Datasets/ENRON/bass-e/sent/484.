Not really, since I had the chance to draft Stephen Davis and passed... While 
I also asked to trade down 2 slots to get Stephen Davis, I am now very 
pleased with the Kult, negotiations with the draftees seems to be going well 
and we should have most with the exception of Bledsoe and Terrell in camp by 
weeks end...

He was my number 2 pick, and I don't want to hear about me drafting him too 
early, else we would not be having this correspondence...
