Subject: JDF T-shirts

Ok, I'm supposed to be getting more XLs today.  If you don't want to trade 
your T-shirt for an XL, please let me know, otherwise leave your T-shirt in 
your chair in case you're not there when I come by.  I'll switch them when I 
get the XLs from our team lead.

Thanks,
Allison
