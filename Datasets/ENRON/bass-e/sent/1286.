shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow, so she will not be alone.
tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year 
when i first started.  he had been dating his fiancee during college but they 
had broken up about a year ago.  he had been trying to get back together but 
i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.  i guess he 
had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went 
well over christmas he went ahead.

have a fun and safe weekend.

Hi E,

Glad to hear all is well with the exception of Toni, of course.  I am sorry
to hear of her unending heartache.  Tell Shanna I'm thinking of all of them.
Is her mother going to be there?

Which one is Tim?  Did you know he was getting engaged?

Have a good weekend.  Everything is good here.  We're going out tonight and
will meet Ken and Cheryl for dinner tomorrow night.

Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to
Happy Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit
Toni tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than
that, just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that
vacation.

How are things on the homefront?

L,
E
