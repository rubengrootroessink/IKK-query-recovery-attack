Hey,
Sorry to hear about mike's Dad.  I hope he is handling it ok.  I'm guessing 
your weekend wasn't very fun.  
We had a great time at the black swan, maybe you can come next time!  Let me 
know when you want to come by.(if ever, ha!)

later

Hey you,
Sorry I didn't get a chance to come by this weekend, mike lutanno's dad
passed away, so I was pretty busy keeping him company.  Other than that, not
too much going on, and you?  I saw your roommate last night at church.
Write back when you get a chance.

Dee
