Hey Allison,

Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It 
seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?

How are things in your world?
You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you 
again?

Eric

Hey Eric,

What's going on?  I haven't seen you in a while...

I was wondering, when can I come by to pick up your check for JDF?  I need an 
excuse to come visit anyway :) 

Allison
