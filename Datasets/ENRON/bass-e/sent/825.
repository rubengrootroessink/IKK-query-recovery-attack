OK- that is it- you either best be in a DAMN good mood by the time you get to 
my place-   OR  I don't know- I'm going to be pissed.  I want to enjoy our 
time together- not fight about you being crabby.  You didn't warn me that you 
were so moody- you ARE like a woman.  And try not to be such a big mouth from 
here on out.  You make me feel like I can't tell you what I really think- b/c 
it will get back to Tim (in other words- all the FIJIS)- I hope that you 
aren't naive enough to think that isn't how it works with them.
