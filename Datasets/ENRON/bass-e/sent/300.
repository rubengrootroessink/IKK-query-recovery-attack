=09
=09Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g=
ames=20
of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa=
st=20
17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend. =20
=09
=09 Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of n=
ew=20
recruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning=
=20
starters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni=
=20
luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=
s=20
have usually come crashing down.=20
=09
=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=
 and=20
1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=
=20
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=
=20
losses. =20
=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=
-1=20
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=
=20
respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20
=09
=09=20
=09
=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=
ast=20
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=
 -=20
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20
being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=
t=20
changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20

=09Chris Simms =20
=09
=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20
=09?? Mitch Golding=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=
=20
because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=
=20
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=
=20
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =
in=20
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=
=20
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20
=09
=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=
k=20
Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=
=20
his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =
He=20
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =
me=20
that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig=
ht=20
it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc=
h=20
like everyone else. =20
=09
=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=
na=20
with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=
,=20
Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=
o=20
prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20
Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=
=20
you also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=
=20
quarterbacks against Stanford?=20
=09?? Nels Marshall=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: "Experience. We were in a tight=
=20
football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro=
ud=20
- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that =
we=20
didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=
=20
of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=
=20
like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har=
d=20
and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=
=20
night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from." =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=
ving=20
any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20
left-handed or right-handed QB?=20
=09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=
ing=20
the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little=
=20
faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=
r.=20
What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=
=20
that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=
so=20
apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount =
of=20
time? =20
=09?? Chad Graham=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=
oes=20
not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20
window. =20

=09Jermain Anderson =20
=09
=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=
ack=20
to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=
s=20
City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the=
=20
necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett=
er=20
suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20
progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and=
=20
Adam Doiron. =20
=09 ?? Micah Hurt=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. =
They=20
are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20
instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t=
he=20
run.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=
=20
football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=
=20
Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=
as=20
remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner=
=20
fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo=
ut=20
the Longhorns. =20
=09?? Barbara and Mark Harper=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20

 the=20
number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.=

how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players =
in=20
the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20
example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=

=09Hodges Mitchell =20
=09
=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=
=20
with opponent's wideouts.
=09
=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=
 all=20
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=
s=20
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=
n=20
anyone at UT block?
=09
=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=
es=20
the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=
n=20
up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=
y=20
against?=20
=09?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=
=20
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=
=20
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=
=20
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=
. I=20
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =
in=20
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=
=20
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=
y=20
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=
=20
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=
=20
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20
=09?? Ernie McAnally=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=
e.=20
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=
d=20
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=
s=20
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=
n=20
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=
re=20
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=
s=20
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=
nd=20
the next two years, he should only get better.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=
=20

or=20
LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20
Williams' run for the Heisman?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=
=20
postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20
media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than=
=20
$10,000, according to UT officials.=20

=09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi=

teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost=
=20
four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20
officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=

to go with those recruiting victories. =20
=09?? T. Hough=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=
n=20
stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20
Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20
programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=

the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam=
es=20
in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20
=09
=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20
faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot=

seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=

done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=

UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,=
