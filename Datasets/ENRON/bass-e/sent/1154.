Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.  

http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html

By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their 
weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.  But 
hey, at least you're still ahead of Iona and Bradley.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
football,
                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
watch.

Enough said.
