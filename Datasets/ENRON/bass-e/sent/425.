I got my little review today.  It was a positive experience.  She didn't 
really say anything negative at all- and she even commented that she felt bad 
not giving me any constructive criticism- but that she was really surprised 
at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.

So- I am currently NOT irritated.

Shanna
