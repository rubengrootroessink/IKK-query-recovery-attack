A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes 
a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. 
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference 
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much 
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Thanks
