THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing "It's Not Easy Being  Green."

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as "Temperatures of the 80's"

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome." Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,"

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of "fairness" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She
  immediately called Saint Peter and said, "This is Sister Margaret. There's
  been a terrible mistake!"


  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The
next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter and called him back.
  "Please set this error straight before tomorrow," she begged. "There's an
orgy planned for tonight, and everyone must attend!"


  "Of course, Sister, "he said. "I'll get you out of there right away."
  Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning he
  received another phone call from hell. He picked up the receiver and
  heard, "Hey, Pete, this is Maggie. Never mind!"

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
"V" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    "Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate," said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    "Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to "pain and suffering" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    "We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers," 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    "Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    "It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem," said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    "I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat."
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    "More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them," he said.
    "But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    "People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing."
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles "quite a 
few" dog bite claims and he has seen "a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    "There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs," Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    "For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm," said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    "We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite," Carroll said. "But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    "The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises."
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.
    "We had been running at about a 3 p________________________________
