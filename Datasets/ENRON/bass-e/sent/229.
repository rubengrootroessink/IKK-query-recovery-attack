I received an invitation in the mail to purchase Rockets tickets online 2 
days earlier than they go on sale to the general public.  The opener is Tues 
10/31 at 7:30 PM vs. the T-Wolves.    I know how much you guys like sitting 
in the cheap seats, so you can listen to comments such as "I'm gonna let you 
hear it-AIRBALL!," and "He just made Sportscenter."  If you want to go to the 
game let me know  and I will buy the tickets this week.
