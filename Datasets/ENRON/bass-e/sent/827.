Hey!  It's going to be a good day- I can already tell.  I just had one of the 
best bagels EVER- and I won a 20 oz Coke and I have cute hair today.  Isn't 
it the small things in life that make you happy?  Well- hope you have a 
better day at work then the past couple- I feel confident that you will- that 
way you won't feel it necessary to get totally loaded tonight on MY date.  Oh 
yeah- I am wearing my orange shirt today.  I have already had so many 
compliments on my brightness-I guess they are all used to me being in black.  
But even though I am wearing my orange- I still only have one thing to say 
------   GEAUX TIGERS!!!!!

Have a great day!!  

Shanna

P.S. Can you tell that I am a little hyper this morning?  I am like bouncing 
off the walls for some reason.  Too bad that I am at work- I rarely get like 
this- but when I do- boy- am I fun!!! :-)  :-)
