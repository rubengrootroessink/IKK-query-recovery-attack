It is at 8:30.  We are supposed to be there at 8 to get all seated together.
This is the Laff Spot on 249 and 1960.  Come up the Beltway and go left on
249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip
shopping center on your right side, about a quarter of a mile past Circuit
City.  It is in the same shopping center as a bar called Frogs Saloon.
Donnita's cell phone is 832-577-8235, in case you get lost.

We would like to come, but Shanna is not sure whether or not she will be
off work by then.  If you have someone else you would like to invite go
ahead.  If not, we will try to make it.

Thanks for the invite and let me know.
