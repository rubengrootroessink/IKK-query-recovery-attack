Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Joanie
