READ THIS. LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU 
START YOUR DAY. 

Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is 
always in a good 
mood 
and  
always has something positive to say.? When someone 
would ask him  how 
he 
was 
doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would  
be twins!" 

He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having 
a bad day, 
Michael 
was there telling the employee how to look  on the 
positive side of the 
situation. 

Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I 
went up to 
Michael 
and asked him, "I  don't get it! You can't be a 
positive person all of 
the 
time.  
How do you do it?" 

Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say  to 
myself, you have 
two 
choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood 
or...you can choose? 
to 
be in a bad 
mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time 
something bad happens, 
I  
can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn 
from it. I choose  
to 
learn from it. 
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can  
choose to accept 
their 
complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of 
life. I choose 
the 
positive side of life. 

"Yeah,  right, it's not that easy," I protested. 

"Yes, it is," Michael said.  "Life is all about 
choices. When you cut 
away 
all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose 
how you react to 
situations. You  choose how people affect your mood. 
You choose to be in 
a 
good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your 
choice how you live 
your  
life." 

I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I 
left  the Tower 
Industry 
to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often  
thought about him 
when 
I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it. 

Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved  
in a serious 
accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications  
tower.? After 18 
hours 
of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was 
released from the 
hospital with rods placed in his back.  

I saw Michael about six months after the accident. 
When I asked him  how 
he 
was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. 
Wanna  see my 
scars?" 

I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what  
had gone through 
his 
mind as the accident took place. "The first  thing that 
went through my 
mind 
was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, " 
Michael replied. 
"Then, 
as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two 
choices: I could 
choose 
to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live." 

"Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?" I 
asked. Michael 
continued, "...the paramedics were  great. They kept 
telling me I was 
going 
to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I 
saw the 
expressions 
on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.? In their 
eyes, 
I read  "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take 
action." 

"What did you  do?" I asked. 

"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions  
at me," said 
Michael. 
"She asked if I was allergic to anything.  "Yes, I 
replied." The doctors 
and 
nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I 
took a deep 
breath 
and 
yelled, "Gravity."  

Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to 
live. Operate on  me 
as 
if I am alive, not dead." 

Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but 
also because of 
his 
amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we 
have the choice 
to 
live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything. 
"Therefore do not worry 
about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 

After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about 
yesterday. 

You have two choices now:  
1. Delete this. 
2. Forward it to the people you care about. 

You  know the choice I made.
