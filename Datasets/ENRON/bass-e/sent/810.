You should now have access to CQG.  To install CQG choose Start, Programs, 
Trading, CQG Local Install.  After the application has
installed you will choose Start, Programs, Trading, CQG to access.  No 
password is necessary, find your name in the drop down menu
and choose login. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Julie
