It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!
