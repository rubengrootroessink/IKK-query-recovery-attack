I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it 
might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low 
ball contract). This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but 
more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.  Let me know when you are 
available to see more houses.  I am free whenever, except for Saturday after 
around 4 pm.

It's been so long since we talked, I don't know what I'm supposed to be
doing.

Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my memory
was refreshed.  Re: precertification for a loan.  A non-committal response
from an online source does not mean that you are precertified.  And, you
must be real careful about all conditions relating to said loan.  Dad thinks
you should call Bob Dunn (call Dad for number.).  Bob is in the mortgage
business and is a good guy to have on your side.  His office is near San
Felipe and Voss.  You should probably get this ball rolling so you are
ready, don't you think?

I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We
could wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for whatever
else you want to see.  I recommend that you see a few more before making an
offer but that is up to you.

Let me know what I can do.  LU-M
