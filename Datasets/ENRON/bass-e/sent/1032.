Subject: Risk Book Post ID's for EOL Reporting

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this.
