Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

Love you, Toot

  Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had more
than your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mail
from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were
in any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simple
with the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from last
year.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games and
Champagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCC
and find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L
