Howdy. Bonnie will be here Thursday, for a week. If  you guys are available, 
we thought we would take all to Brunch @ SWCC, 11 a.m.  Sunday. Girls are 
invited. Let me know if you can make it and if your better  halves will 
accompany you. Do so, please, by Wed., so I can make the  reservations.-Dad
