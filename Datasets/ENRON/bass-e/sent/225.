What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.
