 >
 >AP. A Texas A&M University student who claimed he had been raped by
a dog
 >was yesterday jailed for 12 months.
 >
 >Martin Hoyle, 20, was arrested by police after the passengers of a
passing
 >car witnessed a Bull Terrier, called Badger, having sex with Hoyle
on the
 >side of Highway 290, just north of Hempstead.
 >
 >Assistent District Attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers of
the car,
an
 >unidentified couple from Houston, had stopped to help because they
thought
 >Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.  But when they got closer
they saw
 >that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down on all fours,
and the
 >dog was straddling him from behind.
 >
 >"The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken a
liking to
 >him," said Mr Crossland."The couple were extremely offended and
sickened by
 >what they saw." Another individual in a passing car contacted
police on a
 >cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog on
the
 >feeder road.
 >
 >Hoyle, of College Station, told police "I can't help it if the dog
took a
 >liking to me.He tried to rape me." He repeated the rape allegation
at
 >the police station and added, "The dog pulled my jeans down."
 >
 >Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on alcohol-related
charges, was
 >jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act that
outraged
 >public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incident
because
 >of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful and
incredibly
 >embarrassed.
 >
 >Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle "Never before in my
time at
 >the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who
 >voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public
 >highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension. It is an
 >absolutely disgusting thing for members of the public to have to
witness."
