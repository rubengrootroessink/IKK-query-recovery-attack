(See attached file: JBass Resume.doc)
I made a few changes.  Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better
(preferably fitting on one page).  So most of my changes have been
consolidations.  Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet
points the same (you want to do this on all resumes and outlines).

As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner
on Friday at Pappasitos.  Can you make it?

-Eric

Would you do me a favor and look this over and tell  me things I should
change? Please send it back to this address. You  can make the changes in
the document and send the changed document back.   Thanks.
