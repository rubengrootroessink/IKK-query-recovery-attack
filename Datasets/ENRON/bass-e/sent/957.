He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He is going to wait 
it out another month to see if a new position comes available.  If not, he is 
applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.  I think 
he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am 
waiting to hear about that.

By the way, have you seen Enron's stock the last two days.  It has gone from 
53 to 72.  It 's good to work for the big E!

  I had a really fun time.  There were probably about 10
people from work there
  and my bro.  We stayed out until about 1:30 and then went
home.

  I'm going to start calling you "backout" if you don't shape
up.
