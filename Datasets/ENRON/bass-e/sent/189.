Hello All -

I just wanted to let everyone know that Moni is celebrating her 24th
birthday tomorrow night at Sherlock's.  Michael and I are going for sure,
and if I remember correctly, Lenny, Hector, and Gallin are also planning on
going.   The rest of you better come too.  I know Moni hasn't seen any of
you in awhile, and she would appreciate all of you being there!

Hector - Feel free to repeat history! =)

Hope to see you all there!
