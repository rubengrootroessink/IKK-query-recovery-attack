I really just need historical throughput, especially third party, to the 
major market areas.  I am going to analyze this data from a temperature 
correlation perspective to see if we can use weather derivatives to hedge 
throughput exposure.  
Data as far back as can be pulled accurately would be helpful.

Call with questions.

Thanks,

Eric

We have access to a pretty realistic (close to actual) physical throughput 
number going back to about February of 1998.  Anything prior to that would 
take some work to come up with.  If you are looking for a scheduled 
throughput number the best place to get that data from would be POP's/Unify.  
By totalling all of the reciept or delivery contracts and including any 
Bammel activity, you should get a pretty accurate scheduled throughput 
number.  You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through 
processing plants, partnership activity, etc.

Let me know what you and Ed are looking for and we can help pull the data 
together.

Thanks

Do you have a suggestion as to what data should I provide Eric and Ed to most 
accurately reflect HPL activity? 

Thanks,
Earl

Earl,

James McKay referred me to you for information regarding historical 
throughput numbers on HPL.  Ed Gottlob and I are looking at ways to hedge the 
pipe and need this data as far back as can accurately be obtained.

Thanks,


Eric
