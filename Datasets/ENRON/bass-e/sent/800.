Luis,

I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in 
early April.  So, I will try to schedule a practice.

Let me know when you are back.

Eric

Eric,

I am finally coming home this weekend (from India).  Doesn't flag football 
start soon??  If so, shouldn't we get a practice together at some point next 
week??

Tim,

I can only imagine your excitement w/ LSU and the fact that for one day and 
until your team is eliminated, you are the superior school.  I havent seen 
one minute of one game so your picture was what I had in my mind from what my 
friends told me.  I also know that my tournament brackets are fucked up and 
absurdly low.

Luis
