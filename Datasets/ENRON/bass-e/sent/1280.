I currently plan to extend my rotation for at least 3 to 4 months.  I do not 
have a definitive end date but will let you know when I know for sure.

Thanks,

following options:

Please forward me an updated copy of your resume along with your business

your resume out to those business units with open positions and the managers 
will then contact you directly if they are interested.
Please contact my assistant Jessie Patterson at x3-0927 to schedule a meeting 
with me.  We can discuss your business unit and function preferences at that 
time as well as any other concerns.
If you plan to extend your current rotation, please let me know the date the
