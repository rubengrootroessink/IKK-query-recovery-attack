Dan,

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Eric Bass
