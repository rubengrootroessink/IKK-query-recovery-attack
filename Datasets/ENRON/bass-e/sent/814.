Things are going well here.  I have been pretty busy losing lots of money at 
work.  
Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the month, but I can't go 
because of work.  It doesn't bother me that much though.   I will probably 
try to take a trip over there in May.  On top of that I am thinking about a 
cruise this summer some time.
Brian and I are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the 
Park at Midtown.  Brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony, so we 
are going to move to an interior apartment.  Of course, I wouldn't expect you 
to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment.  Oh well, 
I guess you have your priorities.  

Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  How are things with you and the 
fam?

Hey Ner,
Just wanted to write you a quick note and say hi.  I hope everything is
going o.k.  I haven't heard from you in a while.  How's the fam?  Any trips
planned for you yet?  Have you found out anymore about the Europe trip?  How
is work going?  And the apartment?  Are you still getting along with Brian?
Hope all is going well.

-Dee
