The Associate & Analyst Programs are please to present you with the 
opportunity to attend one of the first four Astro's games in Enron Field.  
There are a limited number of tickets, therefore the tickets will be given 
away through a lottery system.  Program Management will draw names on 
Wednesday, March 29 and the lottery winners will be notified by 4:00 p.m. of 
the same day.

The Lottery rules are as follows:
You are limited to two (2) tickets.  You may submit your name for all 4 
games.  However, you are only eligible to receive tickets to one game.  We 
must have your reply by 2:00 p.m.  Due to the short time frame replies 
received after 2:00 p.m. cannot be considered.
