Hi Mom - 
I got your e-mail yesterday.  Shanna wasn't offended by your poignant 
political comments, she just knows, in no uncerain terms, that your are 
Republican and are going to vote for Bush.  

Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.  I will pay the late 
fee the next time I rent a movie.

How are things otherwise?

-E

Good Morning, Eric-
?
I assume you received my message yesterday but were  too busy to respond.? 
That's o.k.? As a postscript though, I bought  your Dad a new Marine 
sweatshirt so you can keep the other one.? And, I got  another bill from 
Blockbuster for late fees.? Perhaps it would be best if  you get your own 
account.? Have a wonderful day.   LU-M
