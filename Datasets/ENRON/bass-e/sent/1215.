Even trades that won't start flowing or are still flowing this year?  I think 
we can pull an EOL report on transacted volumes but I can't pull a report 
that size until after trading today.

Thanks.

I am looking for volumes that traded last year - not necessarily volumes that 
flowed.  Volumes that flowed include term transactions.
Can you think of a way to find this info?

Here are the total volumes by quarter and by region.  We are looking into the 
EOL since we do not have currently have regional information.  Perhaps you 
have a way of estimating based on CPR?
