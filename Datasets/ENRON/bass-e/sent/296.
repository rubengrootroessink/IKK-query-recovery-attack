walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that is 
the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.

anderson or george?

I need to know fairly quickly

I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
Watters thus far this season.

Eric,

Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson
