OK Gang,
Time to select (and pay) for 2001 tickets.
What I have is:
Gary Lamphier  25 games
Greg Brazaitis  20 games
Jason Mathew  10 games $340
Stacey Neuweiler 10 games $340
Eric Bass     5 games $170
Elsa V      5  games $170
Danny Conner     5  games $170

Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can 
have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game.
We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets 
purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick 
1st, Greg 2nd,
Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and 
Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).  
So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get 
5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one.
So round 1 would look like this:

 1) Gary
 2) Greg
 3) Jason/Stacey
 4) Jason/Stacey
 Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all 
remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else 
once.
We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from 
11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com 
or I will bring hard copies for you.

Please respond today of any date that does not work.
