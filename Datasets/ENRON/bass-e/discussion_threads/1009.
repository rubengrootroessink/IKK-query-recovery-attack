Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see the matchups  this week.? Please=
=20
note, see  thecheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm?=
 =20
for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.????

Locks:? These games heavily  favor the Offense??

Jamal Anderson (Atl) vs Seahawk  Defense?  If you=01,ve learned  anything t=
his=20
season, it=01,s start RBs facing the Seahawk defense.? Fo the year, they ra=
nk #=20
26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Over the last four week=
s,=20
they=01,ve really tailed off ranking # 31 in  rushing yards allowed per gam=
e.? =20
They=01,re playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a  statement.



Warrick Dunn (TB) vs Cowboy  Defense?? The Cowboys haven=01,t gotten any  b=
etter=20
against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear.? Over the last=
=20
four weeks, they rank # 30  in rushing yards allowed per game.?  For the=20
year, they=01,re ranked # 30 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RBs=
.?=20
Dunn=01,s athletic style  will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner d=
id=20
earlier the season.???

Fred Taylor (Jac) vs Brown  Defense?? Cleveland struggles against most  any=
=20
RB but especially tough, physical rushing teams.? Taylor and the Jaguars fi=
t=20
that  bill.? This season has seen some  rushing performances of historical=
=20
significance this year.? You might see another one this  week.? On paper, i=
t=01,
s a dream  matchup.???

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak)  vs Steeler Defense?? I know it=01,s hard to believe =
but =20
the numbers show that over the past four weeks, Pittsburgh ranks # 28 in=20
rushing  yards allowed per game.? They=01,re  allowing 171 yards rushing on=
 the=20
ground.?  Granted, Fred Taylor, Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into=
=20
that  number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isn=01,t too far down below thei=
r=20
class.? He=01,s healthier now than he has been in a  while.



Ricky Watters (Sea) vs Falcon  Defense?? I=01,ve been a Ricky Watters fan  =
since=20
the 49er days.? One of the  best combinations of rushing and receiving in=
=20
some time.? He=01,s had an age defying season and the  roll should continue=
=20
against a Falcon unit that=01,s been awful defending the run  lately.? For =
the=20
last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed per game.? For th=
e=20
year, they=01,re # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.??  Eve=
ryone=20
keeps wondering  when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets=
=20
blown out here (which  I have hard time seeing) I think you=01,ll see plent=
y of=20
Ricky  Watters.?

Corey Dillon (Cin) vs  Cardinal Defense?? Like Fred Taylor vs. Cleveland, =
=20
this one looks almost too good to be true on paper.? They don=01,t always t=
urn=20
out that way in  reality but you=01,ve got to be drooling over this game if=
 you=01,
re a Dillon  owner.? His running in the lack of a  real passing game threat=
=20
is an amazing feat.? Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be  effective=20
throwing the ball which will help even more.

Prime  Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense??

Tony  Richardson / Kimble Anders (KC)? vs  Patriot Defense??  Our support o=
f=20
Christian Okoye  last week for a Chief RB didn=01,t garner much support fro=
m the=20
KC coaching staff  so it looks like another week of Richardson / Anders.?=
=20
Anders actually got plenty of carries  last week and promptly did very litt=
le=20
with them. Richardson appears to be the  better back right now but who know=
s=20
how this will play out.? It=01,s hard for me to advocate  either.? But if y=
ou do=20
go with one,  know that they=01,ll be facing a pretty soft New England rush=
=20
defense that ranks #  25 in rushing yards allowed per gameover the  last fo=
ur=20
weeks.?

Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Brad Hoover (Car) vs Rams  Defense??? Biakabutuka=
=20
found there was  no rehabilitation method quite as effective as 60,000 folk=
s=20
chanting  =01&Hoooooo-ver=018 on Monday night=01(?  Amazing how that consis=
tently=20
works.? Biakabutuka has been upgraded to  probable but I=01,m not convinced=
=20
Hoover just takes his place back on the  bench.? You=01,ll likely see both =
 go.?=20
The Rams still give up a good  bit of yardage on the ground lately averagin=
g=20
127 yards per game over the last  four weeks.? That ranks them #  24.? For=
=20
the year, they rank # 23  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.???

J.R.  Redmond (NE) vs Chief Defense?? The Patriots are a tough team to =20
figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg =
=20
rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny.? But if he can hold them=
=20
together, I=01,ve  got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here.? Th=
e=20
Chiefs rank # 23 over the past four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam=
e.
? For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  R=
B.
?  Keep  an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he can=01,t go, all bets are off b=
ut if=20
he can keep  the defense honest, I like Redmond=01,s chances here.? Of cour=
se,=20
you have to know the risks  that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick=
=20
Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments  notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong =
=20
way=01(



Edgerrin James (Ind) vs  Jets Defense?? The NFL is the ultimate game of =20
watching to see what others do.? You  can bet the Colts are aware of the=20
success Chicago=01,s James Allen had last week  rushing (and fumbling) the =
ball=20
against New York.? I think you=01,ll see a steady diet of  Edgerrin doing t=
he=20
same thing (hopefully not fumbling though)? James is a no brainer =01) star=
t=20
him  against virtually any team unless you=01,re so loaded at RB it=01,s no=
t =20
fair.?

Eddie George (Ten) vs  Eagle Defense?? Philadelphia isn=01,t quite as tough=
  vs=20
the run as their reputation might have you believe.? Over the last four=20
weeks, they rank # 21  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? For the  year,=
=20
they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? But you  can=
=20
pretty much throw those numbers out when it=01,s Eddie George.? He=01,ll ge=
t his=20
yards the hard way.? I=01,d be very surprised if you don=01,t see  George e=
xhibit=20
some leadership here and put together a solid  effort.



Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Colts  Defense?? It sounds like Curtis Martin is  ju=
st=20
going to have to play with the strained buttocks.? (you=01,ve heard enough =
jokes=20
by now, I=01,ll  spare you)? The Indy defense is  definitely vulnerable to =
the=20
rush.?  For the season, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the=20
opposing  RBs.? This game will be in New York  and the Colts are soft when =
it=01,
s cold outside so Martin could have an  edge.?

James Allen (Chi) vs Green  Bay?? Let=01,s give Allen the benefit of  the d=
oubt=20
and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced.? (although I didn=01,t =
see=20
Curtis Martin  fumble three times and he was there too=01()?  If he can fin=
d the=20
handle on the ball, he=01,ll be fine as he actually ran  very while when he=
=20
managed to hang on to the football.? Green Bay proved Monday night they can=
=01,
t  stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears=
=20
and for  Allen.

??

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way?

Travis Prentice / Jamel White (Cle) vs  Jaguar Defense??  This is one of =
=20
those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper.?=20
Jacksonville has yielded an average of  120 yards rushing per game over the=
=20
last four weeks.? That ranks them # 20.? They also rank # 20 for the year i=
n =20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs.? But they=01,re playing better =
than=20
that now  I believe.? And the Browns are just  playing out the season.? And=
=20
the  bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel=
=20
White has  looked impressive.? It=01,s a decent  matchup for Cleveland but =
I=01,d=20
probably shy from these guys if it were  me.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense?? A case of both sides being bette=
r =20
than what many people think.?  Michael Pittman is a player.?  Since Vince=
=20
Tobin left, it=01,s been pretty much Pittman=01,s show on the  ground much =
to the=20
chagrin of Thomas Jones owners.? And on the other side of the ball, the =20
Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for.? On the ground, they=
=20
rank # 17 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? For=
=20
the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  S=
o=20
this once could truly go either way.? I=01,d feel ok with Pittman if he was=
 my =20
guy but I wouldn=01,t be overly excited.?

Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense?? This isn=01,t the best matchup in the=
 =20
world for Smith but you have to start him.?  If nothing else than to get an=
=20
early lead on your opponent with a  Thursday night game.? C=01,mon, that=01=
,s =20
worth something=01(? Seriously, Smith  is one of the elite RBs right now bu=
t=20
Detroit is playing pretty tough against  the run ranking # 15 in rushing=20
yards allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? He=01,s a starter though=
,=20
just  play him.?

Ahman Green (GB) vs Bear  Defense?? Find a nice toasty place to watch  this=
=20
one.? Chicago in December.? At night.? That=01,s football.? With Dorsey Lev=
ens=20
likely gone for the  year, the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man.?=
=20
Chicago has a tough run defense led by  all world rookie Brian Urlacher.? I=
 =20
told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him =01&Vanilla=
=20
Freak=018  and now you=01,re seeing why.? I love  this kid.? These guys are=
 =20
professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy=
=20
with  the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature=20
keeps  dropping.???

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Bills  Defense? Smith practiced Wednesday and while it=
=01,
s  awful early to make a definitive call, it looks like he=01,ll start Sund=
ay.?=20
The Bufallo defense is solid against the  rush.? They rank # 13 in rushing =
=20
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? Although for the year, th=
ey=20
rank # 5 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Although if Smith=
=20
can return to his awesome form before the injury, he=01,ll  be a load.? The=
=20
Dolphins will rely  on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus=
=20
not that good to begin  with.?

Marshall Faulk (StL) vs Panther  Defense?? Let=01,s hope Faulk gets back to=
 his =20
old form.? And let=01,s hope the  Panther defense gets back more their old=
=20
rushing defense form.? Over the last four games, Carolina ranks  # 12 in=20
rushing yards allowed per game.?  But for the year, they come in at # 25 in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB.? It sounds to me like  coach Mi=
ke=20
Martz won=01,t make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best  we=
apons=20
in Faulk.

??

Downside Matchups:? These  games favor the Defense?

Shawn Bryson / Sammy Morris / Antowain  Smith (Buf) vs Miami Defense??=20
Believe it or not, the Dolphin  Defense ranks just # 16 in rushing yards=20
allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? Granted, 3 of those games  don=
=01,t=20
factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have =
=20
thought.? The Bills rushing game is  a mess.? The team is calling Morris=01=
, =20
ankle questionable so we=01,ll have to wait and see.? Bryson has done very=
=20
little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn=01,t produce or we woul=
d=20
have never seen so much  of Bryson and Morris.? With a  healthy Zach Thomas=
,=20
I=01,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.????

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense?? Emmitt Smith said he=01,d never =
been =20
knocked out in his career but that=01,s what happened Thursday.? He=01,s bo=
unced=20
back quickly and says he=01,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.?  The Bucs=
 are=20
tough but not invincible.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in=20
rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.?=
=20
Emmitt=01,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his=
=20
career so I=01,m not overly  concerned with the matchup.? He=01,s a  gamer =
and I=01,d=20
say he=01,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa=
 Bay.



Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense??  Be very leery  here.? Stephen Dav=
is=20
demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of=
=20
salt.? Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recoveri=
ng=20
from injury.?  Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w=
as=20
sure he=01,d  start, I=01,d think very hard about going elsewhere this week=
.? It=01,s=20
not like he=01,s facing Seattle and  this is a dream matchup or something.?=
  The=20
Giants are tough against the run ranking # 2 for the year in Fantasy  Point=
s=20
allowed to the opposing RB. ?So unless you know for sure he=01,s going,  I=
=01,d=20
strongly consider my other options.?

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib =
=20
fracture which must sound worse than it is.? Either that or he=01,s one tou=
gh=20
guy.? The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense=
=20
lately.?  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushi=
ng=20
yards  allowed per game.? That=01,s a marked  contrast to their year long=
=20
numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.=
?=20
Adding  Fletcher=01,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don=01,t see much fro=
m San=20
Diego on the  ground Sunday.?

Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins??  To me, Barber is  looking muc=
h=20
more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don=01,t see  New=
 York=20
taking a lead where they can grind out the clock.? If you=01,re a Dayne own=
er,=20
you=01,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in=
=20
favor of Barber  when his team trails.? The Giants  are a good team but I d=
on=01,
t see them jumping all over Washington.? Plus, the Redskins play very good=
=20
rush  defense.? For the year, they rank #  4 in Fantasy Points allowed to t=
he=20
opposing RB and over the last four weeks,  they rank # 8 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed per game.???

James Stewart (Det) vs Viking  Defense?? Stewart=01,s great game against Ta=
mpa =20
Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but he=01,s go=
t a =20
surprisingly tough situation here.?  Minnesota over the last four weeks ran=
ks=20
# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? For the year, they rank # 14  in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Part of that has to do with the=
=20
Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up=
=20
but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there.? LB Dwayne Rud=
d=20
should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I=01,m=
=20
still not overly excited about the  matchup.? Still though, Stewart is  one=
=20
of the better backs and I=01,d think he=01,s likely a starter for your team=
 unless =20
you=01,re loaded with RBs.

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense?

Darnell  Autry / Stanley Pritchett (Phi) vs Titan Defense??  The Eagle RBs=
=20
have been very little factor and I don=01,t see them all of a  sudden emerg=
ing=20
against a very tough Tennessee defense.? Especially one in a foul mood afte=
r =20
another last second loss from the kicker.?  It=01,s a tough job, but QB Don=
ovan=20
McNabb carries this team almost solely  on his shoulders.? He could be the =
=20
teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs.? For th=
e=20
year, the Titans rank # 6  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.??=
?

Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense?? I like Mike Anderson and he=01,s a=
 =20
great story but he=01,s got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans=
.?=20
The Saints rank # 3 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing=
=20
RB and over the last four games, they  rank # 5 in rushing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game.? They=01,ve just averaged 81 yards per game  allowed rushing.? Anders=
on is=20
still  probably worth a start unless you=01,re really deep at RB but just b=
e=20
aware he=01,s  facing a tough defense.?

Charlie Garner (SF) vs Charger  Defense?? With a week off to prepare, Garne=
r =20
comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first =20
victory.? They=01,re playing rush  defense like we=01,re accustomed to seei=
ng from=20
San Diego ranking # 4 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four=
=20
weeks.? Garner isn=01,t your normal back but he=01,s  facing a tough game h=
ere.? I=01,
d still  start him as he=01,s got that big play potential with the ability =
to go=20
the  distance at any time, but I=01,m not excited about the  matchup.?

Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense?? Jerome Bettis was built for =20
grinding down defenses in the December cold but he=01,ll have a tough match=
up=20
this  week against Oakland.? The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks=
=20
in rushing yards allowed per game.? That=01,s partly why their passing defe=
nse =20
is so bad: teams can=01,t run so they go to the air.? I like Bettis and I t=
hink=20
he=01,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a=20
difficult matchup  here.?

Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense?? Assuming Moore is ok=
=20
with his neck  stinger, he=01,ll be running behind his outstanding OL but t=
his=20
is a tough matchup  against the Denver Defense that=01,s remained tough vs =
the=20
run.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 3  in rushing yards allowed per=
=20
game allowing an average of 74 yards per game.? Ricky Watters and Seattle=
=20
only managed  to post 85 against them Sunday.?  Moore looks to get the=20
majority of carries and goalline work so he=01,s the  better option at this=
=20
point assuming he can go.? But even healthy, he=01,s got his work cut  out =
for=20
him.
