If you would like for me to send cards to your customers, please provide me 
with a list of their names and addresses by next Friday, 11/17.  I will get 
the amount of cards as per however many customer names I am given.  I will 
then have everyone sign one card so that I can send it out to get the 
signatures lasered on the customer's cards.  I've already spoken with the 
others on the desk, and they either aren't interested or they've gotten their 
primary assistants to take care of it.

Elsa, as we've previously discussed, I can use the list that we just recently 
updated.  Please let me know if you are going to select people from that 
list, or if you are just going to send a card to everybody on it.

Thanks guys,
Laura
