Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see  the matchups this week.? Please=
 =20
note, see the cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm?=
=20
for exactly where I rank players and to  determine who to start.? Just =20
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't=20
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup=
=20
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to decidi=
ng=20
between players.??=20

Locks:? These games heavily  favor the Offense=20

Stephen Davis  (Was) vs Cowboy Defense??  New Coach Terry  Robiskie=01,s be=
en=20
saying he=01,ll run Davis into the ground.? Against a run defense as soft a=
s=20
the  Cowboy=01,s, no telling how many yards he=01,ll gain.? The arm seems o=
k and I=20
look for a huge  game here.? RBs roll up 200 yards on  Dallas like it=01,s =
an=20
average day=01(

Darnell Autry /  Chris Warren (Phi) vs Brown Defense??? It remains to be se=
en=20
what  effect (if any) newly signed Chris Warren will have this week.? It=20
wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit if Andy  Reid isn=01,t able to come up with a=
t least=20
a small package of plays that feature  Warren.? He=01,s a thousand times  b=
etter=20
than Darnell Autry.? If he  can=01,t go this week, I=01,d look for him to b=
e a=20
factor next week for sure.?? The Browns defense ranks # 30 in  rushing yard=
s=20
allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is  enticing.

Fred Taylor (Jac)  vs Cardinal Defense?? Every once in a while, those =01&t=
oo =20
good to be true=018 matchups don=01,t pan out.?  This is certainly one of t=
hose=20
=01&too good to be true=018 situations but I=01,d  be shocked if Taylor doe=
sn=01,t just=20
roll over the Cards.? They can=01,t stop the run even when they  know what=
=01,s=20
coming at them.? Arizona  ranks # 29 in rushing yards allowed per game over=
=20
the last month.? That number won=01,t go down any after this  week.

Mike Anderson  (Den) vs Seahawk Defense?? Starting any player facing the =
=20
Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb.?  They=01,ve been pretty bad and this =
week=20
they don=01,t stand a chance against  the dominating OL of Denver.?  Anders=
on=20
practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go.? Keep an eye on the weathe=
r=20
as they=01,re  expecting snow in Denver but I=01,m not too worried about ho=
w it=01,ll=20
effect  Anderson.

Ron Dayne (NYG) vs  Steeler Defense?? This was the type of game they  draft=
ed=20
Dayne for.? A ground war vs  Pittsburgh in December.? It=01,s not  likely t=
he=20
Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode  whic=
h=20
means pretty much no Dayne.?  This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit=
h=20
Bettis on one side and  Warren on the other.

?



Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Sammy Morris  / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs Colts Defense??  Keep an eye on who c=
an=20
go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will  likely have some good=
=20
rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana.? There were some semi encouraging=
=20
signs  that Morris might be back. The Colts rank just # 25 over the last 4=
=20
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? They=01,re  soft on the run and=
=20
someone could make a big splash on Monday  Night.?

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense?? Just as they are with their pass =
=20
defense, the Saints rush defense is overrated.? Over the last four weeks,=
=20
they rank # 23  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? And  Garner is liable =
to=20
explode at any time.?  He=01,s too good in both the rushing and passing gam=
e to=20
consider sitting  down unless you=01,re just loaded.?

Warrick Dunn  (TB) vs Miami Defense?? It was surprising to me to see the =
=20
Dolphins slide this far on rush defense.?  Over the last four weeks, they=
=20
rank # 23 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? Doesn=01,t seem  right but t=
hat=01,s=20
what the numbers say.?  Either way, Dunn=01,s a must start given what he=01=
,s done=20
lately.?=20

Robert Smith  (Min) vs Ram Defense?? Like the passing defense, the Rams  ru=
sh=20
defense has improved over the year.?  It doesn=01,t matter though.?  You=01=
,ve got=20
to start Robert Smith.?  End of story.? He may be the  best RB in the leagu=
e=20
if truth be told.???

Emmitt Smith  (Dal) vs Redskin Defense?? I think I may be the only one who =
=20
sees it this way, but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real=20
statement  for Smith.? Sure, he still may not  get the 3rd down carries as=
=20
they get a look at Michael Wiley but  Emmitt is pretty much working without=
 a=20
net here.? He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a=
=20
tough Tampa team.?  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in=
=20
their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when=20
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing=
=20
yards allowed per  game so they=01,re very beatable.?

Tony  Richardson (KC) vs Panther Defense??  Another week, another RB shakeu=
p=20
in KC as this time it=01,s Kimble Anders  who=01,s out of the mix.? I hones=
tly =20
have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it=
=20
looks  like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now.? The Panthe=
rs=20
can be run on.? Keep an eye on the weather in this one  as the passing game=
=20
could be limited.



James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense?? What a mess Chicago finds itself =
=20
in.? The messiah QB is now healthy  but still on the bench while the =01&gu=
ru=018=20
offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both=
=20
starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries.? James Allen may be the =
=20
bright spot as he=01,s run hard and effectively.? The New England defense c=
an=20
be  vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on=
=20
Allen to  carry a heavy load.

?

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Edgerrin James (Ind) vs Bills  Defense??  Edgerrin may be  having one of th=
e=20
best =01&poor=018 seasons in NFL history.? He=01,s posting great numbers ov=
erall but =20
you=01,ll have a hard time finding a James owner who=01,s real happy with h=
im.? If=20
he=01,s your guy, you have very little  choice but to start him in the Mond=
ay=20
Night game.? The Colts are tougher at home and  hopefully they won=01,t fin=
d=20
themselves playing catchup again.? Although with his receiving ability,  he=
=01,s=20
still active in that situation but it=01,s not the ideal scenario for any R=
B =20
when his team is playing from behind.?  The Bills rank # 18 over the last=
=20
four weeks in rushing yards allowed per  game so it=01,s a pretty average=
=20
rushing  defense.?

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) vs Jets  Defense?? I=01,ll keep an eye on this one fo=
r =20
you but I=01,m hearing while the ankles may be better, a broken finger may =
be =20
giving him trouble.? Some are  speculating this is the cause of his 2 fumbl=
es=20
last week.? The Jets play pretty solid rush defense  so it=01,s truly a mat=
chup=20
that could go either way.? I=01,ll try to see what I can find out on  this =
one.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Jaguar  Defense?? The Pittman injury watch=20
continues  as he=01,s still battling turf toe.? He  sat out of practice Thu=
rsday=20
and may not know his status until Friday or  Saturday.? If he can=01,t go, =
it=20
looks  like Clarence Williams could get the start.? If you=01,re scrambling=
 for=20
RBs, he=01,s  likely available in your league.?  Even assuming Pittman can =
go,=20
it=01,s not a great matchup as the Jags have  picked up the level of their =
play=20
lately.?

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Buccaneer Defense??  Don=01,t let the Buc defense scar=
e=20
you.? They=01,re a very good unit but as Emmitt  Smith proved last week, a=
=20
determined rusher can fare ok there.? Lamar Smith surely falls under that =
=20
=01&determined=018 class.? If he=01,s your  guy, I=01,d still go with him.?=
 Tampa  ranks=20
# 16 over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game.? They=01,re=
=20
allowing an average of 108 yards  per game over that time so it=01,s not li=
ke=20
they=01,re Baltimore (48 yards per game  over their last 3)

?

Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Raider Defense??  Like Tampa, the Raiders rush defen=
se=20
has a bark that=01,s a little worse  than their bite.? They=01,re solid but=
  not a=20
defense that sends RBs running for cover.? They rank # 17 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  Martin looked great last week=
=20
and looks to be guy they=01,re counting on to  carry the offense.? =20

?

Eddie George (Ten) vs Bengal  Defense?? Most people have this image in  the=
ir=20
heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run.? Not so.? Over the=
=20
last four weeks, only 8 teams  are tougher in allowing rushing yards per=20
game.? Maybe that=01,s because teams choose to  pass the ball where Cincinn=
ati=20
is weak but the bottom line is teams don=01,t run a  tremendous amount on t=
hem.?=20
However,  if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee,? you=01,=
ll=20
see a team that runs the ball as  their 1st, 2nd and 3rd option.? (pretty=
=20
much their style with a healthy  McNair too=01()?? George is a must  start =
even=20
though it=01,s no slam dunk on the matchup.

?

James Stewart (Det) vs Packer Defense??  Depending on the weather and Charl=
ie=20
Batch=01,s ribs, Stewart could be asked  to carry the load this week.? Gree=
n =20
Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on=
 =20
defense.? On the flip side, they=01,re  playing pretty stingy rush defense=
=20
averaging 104 rushing yards allowed per game  over their last 4 which ranks=
=20
them # 14.? =20

??

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Brad Hoover (Car)  vs Chief Defense??  With Tshimanga  Biakabutuka revertin=
g=20
back to his normal =01&can=01,t stay healthy=018 form he=01,s  displayed fo=
r most of his=20
career, Hoover gets another shot this week.? The Chiefs are tough at home a=
nd=20
the  weather could be a factor (possibly in his favor) but Hoover will take=
=20
his power  rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares.? Kansas City=
=20
ranks # 8 over the last four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so th=
ey=01,
re pretty  solid.

Travis Prentice /  Jamel White (Cle) vs Eagle Defense?? Neither of these gu=
ys=20
is doing a  great job and they=01,ll both likely struggle against an Eagle =
team=20
that=01,s serious  about defense.? If it were me, I=01,d  look elsewhere if=
 these=20
were my guys.

Marshall Faulk  (Stl) vs Viking Defense?? While they=01,re under appreciate=
d, =20
the Viking rush defense is pretty good.?  Over the last four weeks, they ra=
nk=20
# 11 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? They=01,ll have all they want  wi=
th=20
Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher one=01,s Faulk will  f=
ace.?=20
He=01,s still a no brainer to  start regardless of the opponent.?  He=01,s=
=20
reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being  worried=
=20
about them both.? Coach Mike  Martz has talked about using him on special=
=20
teams to help turn that unit  around.

J.R. Redmond /  Patrick Pass / Kevin Faulk (NE) vs Bears Defense??  With=20
Redmond still ailing, the Patriot RB situation is a mess.? And Bill Belichi=
ck=20
certainly isn=01,t  shedding much light on anything.?  Unless Redmond shows=
 he=20
can be 100%, I=01,d probably shy away from all 3 of  them as it=01,s too mu=
ch of a=20
shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick.? The Bears are playing pretty=
=20
tough rush  defense with rookie sensation Brian  Urlacher.

Ahman Green (GB)  vs Lion Defense?? One bright spot for the Packers  this=
=20
year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green.? Coach Mike Holmgren in=
=20
Seattle could  have likely saved a # 1 pick on Alexander if Green was still=
=20
in Seattle.? Green=01,s always had the physical skills  but he lagged behin=
d in=20
other areas.?  Now, he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up=
 =20
significantly and the results are showing on the field.? It=01,s a tough ma=
tchup=20
as the Lions rank #  7 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game but I think he=01,s up  for it.

??

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Ricky  Watters (Sea) vs Bronco Defense?? Denver evidently didn=01,t take  k=
indly=20
to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago  =
as=20
they=01,ve been tough against the run since then.? Over the last four weeks=
,=20
they rank # 2  in rushing yards allowed  per game allowing just 57 yards pe=
r=20
game.? Watters is a solid player and not unlike  an Emmitt Smith, he=01,s a=
 guy=20
that=01,s made a living performing against the tough  teams in tough games.=
? So=20
it=01,s not  like I=01,m terrified of this matchup.?  Just be aware, it=01,=
s a tough=20
one.?  One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has=
=20
said  at some point, he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander,=20
especially in the  passing game.? How much he=01,d like to  see isn=01,t kn=
own=20
right now.?

Terrell  Fletcher (SD) vs Baltimore Defense??  Let=01,s not go there.? =20
Baltimore is allowing an average of 48 yards rushing per game over their =
=20
last 3 games.? I don=01,t see Fletcher  as the guy who breaks that trend.?

Jerald Moore  / Chad Morton / Terry Allen (NO)? vs  49er Defense??? Early=
=20
this week, both Moore  and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss=
=20
Sunday=01,s game.? They appear to be healing ahead of  schedule and now it =
looks=20
like both may play.? Allen spent time running with the first  unit in=20
practice so it=01,s really murky right now.? I=01,d tend to shy away from a=
ll these=20
guys  as I think they=01,ll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did =
last =20
week.? Besides, the 49ers are  deceptively stingy against the rush ranking =
#=20
3 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.???

Corey Dillon  (Cin) vs Titan Defense?? Yes, this is a tough matchup.? But s=
o=20
was Denver and the jersey Dillon  wore in that particular tough matchup is=
=20
now hanging in Canton, Ohio.? I learned (and I hope you did too) to go  wit=
h=20
the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent.? Tennessee is very go=
od=20
in defending the  rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon=20
unless you=01,re just  loaded.?

Jamal Lewis  (Bal) vs Charger Defense?? Lewis is clearly the class of the =
=20
rookie crop offensively.? I hear  some say they think his early season elbo=
w=20
injury was actually a blessing as it  let him stay fresh.? I don=01,t know =
=20
about that but I do know he=01,s running very hard and effectively.? He doe=
s=20
draw a tough matchup this week  against a Charger defense that=01,s only=20
allowing 81 rushing yards per game over  the last 4 games which earns them =
a=20
ranking of # 5.? Still though, you pretty much have to  ride Lewis if he=01=
,s=20
your guy.?

Jerome  Bettis (Pit) vs Giant Defense?? This could be a classic battle =20
between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis.? Bettis lives for the=
se=20
kind of games and  he=01,ll get to lay it on the line Sunday.?  He=01,s a l=
ikely=20
starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the  rush.? Over th=
e=20
last four weeks,  they rank # 6 in rushing  yards allowed per game.?  I=01,=
d=20
still feel good about starting Bettis if he were on my roster but you  need=
=20
to be aware it=01,ll likely be tough going.=20
