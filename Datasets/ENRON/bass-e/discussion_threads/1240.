??TravelTips 
?
Travel Planner
?

Hole-punch all of your information for your trip (and make copies  of 
anything you'll need), organize it by what you'll need chronologically,  and 
place it in a slim, bright, lightweight soft-side plastic binder.  It's very 
easy to find in your carry bag, and you can easily flip  through to find your 
itinerary, the address of the hotel you're  going to, the phone number of the 
person you're supposed to hook  up with, etc. - Anita Brienza 

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!
