 Latest NFL Player News 

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. "Right now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see 
what (today) brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight "tweak" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. "I feel fine," Smith 
said, "I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now "optimistic" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. "If he's OK 
(today), he's starting," said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00 
 King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas.  He sat out a 
workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after 
taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys.   
King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to 
change against Dallas this week.  The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5  
passing yards per game this season.  But King is still one of the better QBs 
in the league.  He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good 
enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs.     

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him 
questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay.  The Cowboys, who have been 
devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who 
has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks. Fantasy 
owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James 
McKnight for the duration of the season.     

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be 
Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals. He has only 
thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing 
time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept 
him out of last week's game against the Giants. Fantasy owners should avoid 
Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs 
beginning for most leagues.     

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 
24.  "There's a chance he can come back," coach Jim Haslett said. "We're kind 
of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs."  Most Fantasy 
leagues will be over by Week 17.  But if your team is still playing having 
Williams will definitely help.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00 
 Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not 
healthy enough to take a gamble on.  "I'll definitely play this week," said 
Owens.  "It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate."   Owens' toe is 
purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed.  Don't expect him to put 
up good numbers this week.  Use another receiver instead of Owens if 
possible.     

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six 
passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win. He will start in place of his 
injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers 
against the Redskins. It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster 
this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably 
find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00 
 Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last 
Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented 
Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 
yards in the team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable 
matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.    

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington.  
He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two 
weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius will replace 
Hilliard once again.    

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season.  He accounted for 82 
yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals. 
The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main 
offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive.  
Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting 
Barber in your starting lineup.    

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's 
win over Arizona.  Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as 
the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win.  
In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week 
shouldn't be much different. Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows 
it.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00 
 Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last 
week's win over Arizona.  He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing 
eleven touchdown passes in his last five games. He will face off against a 
tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth 
ranked pass defense. Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so 
you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it.     
 

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00 
 Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 
59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into 
overtime. The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland. Vanderjagt 
remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter 
your league's playoffs.      

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00 
 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns.  He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.   

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 "The Edge" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five 
passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami. He faces the Jets this 
week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten. 
Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as 
always, will be the Colts' main man on offense.     

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's loss to Miami. He will face the Jets this week in New York, which 
may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners. The Colts haven't faired well in 
the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay. Start 
Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's 
cold weather misfortunes.     

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00 
 Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three 
games.  The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler 
some time to heal his wounds.  It will also give them a chance to evaluate 
Johnson.  Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to 
avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason.  
Keep an eye on him though.  If he plays well he may be worth drafting next 
year.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but 
the team decided not to let him play just before gametime. He is close to 
being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice 
first. "Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out 
and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it," said 
Coach Jeff Fisher. "I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against 
Philadelphia]." Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he 
hasn't had a reception since October 1.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against 
Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' 
receiving picture. As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, 
don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks. Check back 
with him next season.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of 
the battered Chris Chandler.  Don't expect Johnson to do too much better.  He 
should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the 
Falcons receivers don't get open enough.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00 
 The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their 
injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He has routinely been listed 
as probable for games this season, yet has played every game. More surprising 
is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of 
center Dermontti Dawson. Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring 
injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence 
to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis.  

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for 
Sunday's game against Oakland. He is expected to play, though, as he was also 
listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway. If he can't go, 
then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably 
get the call.  

 Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland 
with a broken foot. He is expected to run this week for the first time since 
he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week. 
Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, 
as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job.  

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play 
against the Cowboys Sunday.  He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used 
primarily as a blocker on the return team.    

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is 
questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers.  If he is unable 
to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third 
receiver.  Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he 
might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league 
that allows more than two receivers.

 Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00 
The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the 
Vikings. Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter? Or both? What will 
they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith? It may not matter too 
much if they double-team Moss. He has been known to make catches in double 
coverage but Carter is a different story. They focused their energies on 
stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, 
but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs. Thursday's game could be a 
long one for the Lions' defense. If you have them hope that they can find a 
way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team. 

 Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 
Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable 
on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. "Right 
now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see what (today) 
brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to 
use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the 
Fantasy playoffs beginning. 

 Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a "stress reaction on the 
mid-lower leg," which is a precursor of a stress fracture. He will have his 
leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, 
meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season. If you 
have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not 
worth holding onto him at this point. 

 Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the 
stretch. That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike 
Cloud. Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell 
Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins. 

 Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 
Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game 
against the Cowboys. With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin 
James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now. 
Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run 
defense this Thursday. 

 Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. 

 Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00 
Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin 
injury. Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game. As long as 
Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the 
Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00 
Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte 
Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete 
with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year. Nedney will be an unrestricted 
free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his 
kicking leg during the preseason. "It's not that I'm not enjoying my time 
here," said Nedney. "It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was 
brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, 
he'll be the guy." 

 Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards. He 
is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks. 
New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff 
Blake. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00 
Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 
2001, and why wouldn't he. He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading 
rusher, gaining 840 yards this season. Allen will be a restricted free agent 
after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like 
to bring him back next season. If Allen remains confident he will be a good 
Fantasy backup next season. Look for him to have a big game this week against 
a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over 
them Monday. 

 Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00 
Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics. He has been very 
inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of 
the season. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.
