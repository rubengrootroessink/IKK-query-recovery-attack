          A MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                     Sunday, November 5, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  Tuesday is Election Day and I'm asking for your vote.

  Americans are ready for a fresh start. They want a leader
  who trusts them -- not government -- to make decisions for
  their communities.  They want bold leadership that will
  reach across party lines to get things done.

  I am that leader.  I will work to change the tone in
  Washington, D.C. to use these good times for great
  purposes such as reforming public education so every
  child learns to read and creating an environment where
  entrepreneurs and families can flourish and realize their
  dreams.

  I am also committed to providing immediate prescription
  drug coverage for seniors and strengthening our Social
  Security to preserve its benefits for the greatest
  generation and their children and grandchildren.

  This is a close race. Every vote matters. I'm asking for
  your vote and your help.  I urge you to click on this
  link (http://www.georgewbush.com/you.html) for the tools
  that will help you get one undecided voter to vote.
  Please take your family, friends and neighbors to the
  polls to vote for me on Tuesday, November 7th.


  Sincerely,


  George W. Bush
  Governor
  State of Texas


  P.S. If you receive a phone call attacking me or my
  proposals please record it or make note of the attack
  and report it by calling 1-800-878-9374.
