 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=
ht=20
ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games th=
is=20
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, s=

keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the=20
waiver wire.   =20

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=
=20
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=
=20
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries an=
d=20
will be easy prey for Wallace.  =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of=20
Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver sa=
y=20
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel=20
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston=20
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll=20
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=
is=20
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20
