REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
"The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
"...the tone...was perfect...

"There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts."

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, "should." You know, Yogi Berra once said,
"It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: "...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists."

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: "...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, "Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?"  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing..."
