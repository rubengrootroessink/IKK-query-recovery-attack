 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.
