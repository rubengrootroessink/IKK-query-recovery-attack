                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's "full disclosure" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans
