Welcome back to my old friends and I look forward to meeting my first-timers.

I will set up a meeting with you between now and December 13th.

I will also talk to your current supervisor/ direct report during this same 
period.

Please complete your Reviewer Suggestion List now and bother your supervisor 
to go into PEP and approve it.

I will want a personal profile from each of you with the following;

Education
Brief job history (non-ene)
Rotations at Enron and to whom you reported
Current job description (projects underway, etc.)
Accomplishments this year (include 1st half)

You only need to get me this information the day before we meet, but for 
those over-achievers, or over-worriers, I wanted to give you time to work on 
it.
