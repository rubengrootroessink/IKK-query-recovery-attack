Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to "Certify the Bush
Victory."

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative "hand-counting" techniques
to convert so-called "dimpled chads" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be "listening to the will of the
people."  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
