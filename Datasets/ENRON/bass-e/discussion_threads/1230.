Hi  Folks

Before we get  started...

Congratulations on being in  the playoff hunt.? That's something to be prou=
d=20
of.? You have to be a  little bit lucky to get this far but don't hesitate =
to=20
pat yourself on the back  as skill plays a huge part.? Judging from the=20
emails, tons of you are still  in mix.? Don't forget about our Wall of=20
Champions feature  where we'll showcase league winners.? Stay tuned for mor=
e =20
details.

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20
Players.? As we head down the  final weekend for many teams, identifying=20
those players moving up or down can be  the difference between?dominating=
=20
your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in  the money.? As we head into our  16=
th=20
week of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable that some guys  will have=
 made=20
both the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make sure you understand, what we=01,r=
e =20
talking about is players that are moving.?  In other words, a player like T=
E=20
Ricky Dudley could appear on the  downgrade list and still be good enough t=
o=20
be a starter in your league.? It just means I=01,m concerned about the  way=
 he=20
seems to be heading.?  Likewise, a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t=
he=20
upgrade list even  though he=01,s still fairly far down the list of WRs.? I=
t=01,s=20
all about which direction players  are moving.? Keeping an eye on these =20
trends as they can very often make all the difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Jeff Garcia (SF)?  Cheatsheets.net Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to=
=20
roll.? No  coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we=
ek.

QB Donovan McNabb (Phi)? Mixed  emotions here as I've been hyping McNabb fo=
r=20
weeks as the guy carrying the  Eagles offense.? But seeing him on my=20
opponent's roster in the FanEx  playoffs yesterday was less than heartening=
=20
throwing for 4 TDs and 390  yards.? Just be aware the Eagles are off this=
=20
week and won't return till  week 17.?=20

QB Jon Kitna (Sea)? Like Mike  Holmgren, maybe I've been too critical of=20
Kitna.? He continues to play well  and while it likely won't be in Seattle,=
=20
he looks like a starter for some team  in 2001.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? A telling  mark of a great QB is how he performs when=
=20
he comes with less than his "A"  game.? Brooks looked much less in synch=20
Sunday and clearly struggled at  times making a few bad throws and missing=
=20
open receivers.? Yet he hung in  and still posted outstanding numbers.? His=
=20
108 rushing yards quietly add to  the points.? He's a player.? I'm starting=
=20
him with few  reservations.?=20

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? You  have to believe his confidence is sky high.? H=
e=20
obviously benefited from  the return of Ike Hilliard (who looked very good)=
?=20
This team is looking  very tough and very balanced right now.? The running=
=20
game is just good  enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so=20
dominant that it hurts the  QB.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac)? It's  really weird.? When the hype finally subsides=
=20
about this guy, he starts  delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype.? Go=
=20
figure.?=20

QB Kurt Warner (StL)? This may  have been the greatest QB performance in th=
e=20
history of the league without  scoring a TD.? The guy was incredible=20
completing 84% of his passes (27 of  32)? Completing 84% with an average pa=
ss=20
of 12.8 yards is sick.? The  TDs will come as Warner looked as good as I've=
=20
ever seen him placing the ball  perfectly and directing his offense.

QB Ray Lucas (NYJ)? Keep an eye  on Vinnie's groin.? Better yet, watch the=
=20
injury reports for news on  Vinnie's groin.? That's better.? We should know=
=20
more soon but if it's  serious, Lucas will get the start.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Marshall Faulk (StL)? I know  you don't need me to list him here but it'=
s=20
worth noting I think he may be the  best player in the league right now.?=
=20
Martz fed him the ball 25 times and  he delivered.

RB Eddie George (Ten)? George  showed outstanding pass receiving skills and=
=20
added 2 receiving TDs to go with  his rushing TD.? He reinjured his sore to=
e=20
but looks to be ok.? Keep  an eye on it though.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? What a  shocker.? Taylor runs wild again as we=20
predicted.? He did tweak a knee  so watch that but if he can go full speed,=
=20
he's a no brainer starter against  just about anyone.

RB James Allen (Chi)? If  departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was=
=20
dead (don't get excited Bears  fans, he's not), he'd be spinning in his gra=
ve=20
to see Allen garner 37 carries  Sunday.? Be a little leery though as a 2.6=
=20
ypc carry average only works  when you carry the ball a ton.?=20

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)? After  fading badly, Prentice comes roaring back=
=20
with a 2 TD performance.? He only  had 46 yards on 17 attempts but the TDs=
=20
are huge.? The Brown offense  featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson=
=20
occasionally at QB but they looked  much better.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? What  else can you say?? The Denver OL is having=20
another Pro Bowl season.?  Anderson is a must start vs any team right now.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'm very  nervous if I'm Dorsey Levens right now.?=20
Green's been an offensive stalwart  carrying the load week after week.?=20
Everyone always knew he had the  potential to be this good but now he's=20
delivering.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal)? As was  mentioned on the broadcast yesterday, "Someo=
ne=20
forgot to tell the Redskins this  game is a rivalry"? You know the Cowboys=
=20
and Emmitt in particular had to  enjoy humiliating the Redskins.? It would =
be=20
a bold move even for him but I  wouldn't be surprised in the least to see=
=20
Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie  before his obligatory three games are up.=
?=20

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes=
=20
me look bad for dissing him this  Summer...? Against the Cardinals this wee=
k,=20
he has the chance to be even  better.

RB Warrick Dunn (TB)? If Dunn  had any help, the Bucs would scary.? Right=
=20
now, he's doing it all by  himself.? Which probably isn't a bad thing for=
=20
Dunn owners.

RB Tony Richardson (KC)?  Richardson netted 5.2 ypc on 17 carries.? Donnell=
=20
Bennett looks to have  cartilage damage to his knee so Richardson's workloa=
d=20
should increase.?  It's a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther=20
Cunningham to give Richardson  more looks.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car)?  Don't hold your breath but Biakabutuka is=
=20
making noises about returning to the  lineup this week.? We'll see...

RB Terry Allen (NO)? In a  lesser version of Denver's OL, it appears most=
=20
anyone can run effectively behind  these guys.? Allen looked rejuvenated=20
Sunday and should only get better as  he gets familiar with the system.

RB Chris Warren (Phi)? Remember  that he's off this week but if your league=
=20
runs through week 17, he could be a  factor.?=20

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)??  Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong=20
numbers.? As is Jon  Kitna.? Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could=20
continue his  roll.

WR Torrance Small / Charles Johnson  (Phi)? Look what QB Donovan McNabb can=
=20
do when his WRs decide to  show up.? If they can continue to play well, thi=
s=20
team could be  scary.? Remember they're off this week but return in week 17=
.

WR Amani Toomer (NYG)? Of the resurging Giants,  Toomer's leading the=20
charge.? He's making plays all over the field and even  had a nice run agai=
n.

WR Terrell Owens (SF)? The  scary part is he could have been even better th=
an=20
the 129 yard / 1 TD  performance Sunday.? He looked very good coming back=
=20
from the toe injury  and should only get better.? The 49ers are trying to=
=20
nail down their WR  corps for 2001 and Owens is making a statement.

WR Ed McCaffrey (Den)? It's  easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod=
=20
Smith but the truth of the matter  is that they're both excellent WRs.? I=
=20
love McCaffrey and his 6th grade  shoulder pads.? He's the anti-Eric=20
Dickerson when it comes to pads (or lack  thereof)? Easy Ed goes with prett=
y=20
much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder  pads and that's it.? Oh yeah, he's al=
so=20
a great WR...

WR Darrell Jackson (Sea)?  Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and=20
delivered.? I see few reasons  why he won't continue to shine.

WR Torry Holt (StL)? It's tough  to predict which Ram WR will catch the=20
passes from Warner but as I said several  weeks ago, Holt may be the best W=
R=20
on the team.? And that's no sleight to  Isaac Bruce - Holt's that good.?=20

WR Terry Glenn (NE)??  Glenn's putting together one of his most complete=20
seasons.? And Bledsoe's  continuing to play pretty good football which help=
s.

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? 1  catch.? 1 TD.? You gotta like a guy who gets rig=
ht=20
to the point.?  Joe Horn is the clear #1 threat but Jackson is a serious=20
option too.

WR Germane Crowell (Det)? This  didn't look like a guy returning from a=20
broken leg.? He should continue to  get better as he becomes more involved =
in=20
the flow of things.=20

WR Bobby Shaw (Pit)? It seems  hard to believe, but Bobby Shaw is a=20
legitimate starter in many leagues.?  He's getting lots of looks and the=20
Steeler are throwing the ball.=20

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? Hilliard  looked well rested as he roared back onto=
=20
the scene.? An sprained knee  suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa=
se=20
Hilliard's playing time even  further.

WR Donald Hayes (Car)? Hayes  looked better as expected and turned in a nic=
e=20
game catching 5 passes for 77  yards.? The Panthers need to remain focused=
=20
but if they can, Hayes could  contribute.

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min)?  McWilliams again was active catching 5 passes=
=20
for 53 yards.? I like any  receiver on this team.

TE Andrew Glover (NO)? Glover's  starting to become a very integral part of=
=20
the New Orleans passing game.?  It's hard to imagine this team losing=20
Ricky?Williams, Jeff Blake and Cam  Cleeland.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? He's no  Wesley Walls but he's more than adequate.

TE Greg Clark (SF)? He only had  24 yards but the 4 receptions were a nice=
=20
bonus.?=20

?

QBs Moving  Down

QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)? The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the =
=20
guy we remembered.? This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the=
 =20
dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential.

QB Jeff  George (Was)? I've gotta say I'm really surprised George didn't =
=20
post some great numbers.? Albert Connell isn't nearly as good as he thinks =
=20
he is and that may be part of the problem.

QB Steve  Beuerlein (Car)? It's clear to everyone that 1999 was a career =
=20
year.? He's still subject to a great game here and there but he's just too =
=20
streaky to lean very heavily on.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? This guy just isn't very good.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? I've never been a big Charlie Batch fan although=
=20
he's  certainly had his days.? He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and=20
possibly  losing Herman Moore won't help.? (Although German Crowell is back=
)

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve =
=20
Young a call.? A sore back is one thing.? Not remembering your kid's  names=
=20
is an entirely different matter. It's not worth it, Guy.

QB Ryan  Leaf (SD)? Part of it was Baltimore.? A large part of it was  Leaf=
.

QB Jay  Fiedler (Mia)? Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non =20
throwing shoulder.? The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely =20
whether it'll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB.

QB Vinnie  Testeverde (NYJ)? Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may=
 =20
not be serious.? He's not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this=
 =20
one.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Ron  Dayne (NYG)? It's just hard to get excited about starting this guy =
=20
as he's such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan.? He's always liable to=
 =20
grab that short yardage TD but you just don't know when or where they'll =
=20
happen.

RB Jerald  Moore (FA)? Things change quickly in this league.? A few  weeks=
=20
ago, Moore looked to be the #1 RB.? Now he's unemployed.

RB Darnell  Autry (Phi)?? I'd expect that Chris Warren will cut into his =
=20
time when they return.

RB Jamel  White (Cle)? Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched=
 =20
this week.

RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? He came back to reality this week.? On top of  that,=
=20
it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to  t=
ry=20
and return this week.

?

WRs Moving  Down=20

WR Herman  Moore (Det)?? Moore suffered?a neck stinger  Sunday.? He could=
=20
likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good  returning from his=
=20
injury.

WR Tai  Streets (SF)? Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action  a=
s=20
the 49ers tried to see what they had for 2001 but with the return of Terrel=
l =20
Owens, it looks like Streets will be limited.

WR  Courtney Hawkins (Pit)? He's losing time to Bobby Shaw.? The  Steeler W=
Rs=20
seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw.

WR Danny  Farmer (Cin)? Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot =
=20
alongside Peter Warrick but it doesn't look like it's going to make any =20
difference.

WR J.J.  Stokes (SF)? Like Tai Streets, Stokes suffers from the return of =
=20
Terrell Owens.?=20

WR  Sylvester Morris (KC)? Morris continues his regression which  should se=
nd=20
red flags as owners look towards 2001.

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)? With Shaun King struggling, I don't see a  brigh=
t=20
future for Keyshawn ahead.? He sounds like a politician conceding  when he=
=20
speaks of the team finding it's identity in running the ball.?=20

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? In the up and down season from Anthony Becht, it =
=20
looks like he's headed down a bit.? The injury to Testeverde affects his =
=20
stock in a negative way.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he =20
suffered a broken ankle.

TE Jeff  Thomason (Phi)? Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the =
=20
primary TE.?=20

TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman, =
=20
LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon.
