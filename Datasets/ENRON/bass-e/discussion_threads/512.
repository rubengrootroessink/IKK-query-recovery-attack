Confirming what we thought this morning when we ranked Jeff George and not
Brad Johnson on our week 10 cheatsheet

Brad Johnson Out, Jeff George to Start
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1101/851321.html    From the article:  Jeff
George was named the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for Sunday's
game at Arizona.

Coach Norv Turner said George would start after Brad Johnson was unable to
practice Thursday for a second consecutive day. Johnson sprained a knee
ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. George missed Wednesday's
practice to attend the birth of his son, his third child.

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million contract in April to back up
Johnson. He has yet to play a down this season and has taken only about 10
percent of the snaps in practice.

"He had a very good practice today," Turner said. "He's into it, in terms of
what we're doing."  The Redskins have a bye after the Arizona game, but
officials are uncertain whether Johnson will be able to return for the
following game, a Monday night trip to St. Louis.

"He's got a pretty tender knee," trainer Bubba Tyer said. "Grade 2 sprains
could be two weeks, could be four weeks."  Further complicating the
Redskins' offensive preparation for this week, three receivers are suffering
from injuries, with Irving Fryar the most serious. Fryar, who missed
practice Wednesday because of a rib-cartilage injury, returned Thursday but
is questionable for Sunday.

Albert Connell practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable. And
James Thrash also practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is probable.


My View:  I'm sure Jeff George isn't available in your league but if he's on
your roster, now might be the time to consider him.  I'm not overly excited
though as Arizona has a pretty tough pass defense.  Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 5 in passing yards allowed per game.  For the season,
they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing QB so they're not
quite as tough there.   This could likely be an audition for 2001 as many
feel George is the Redskin QB of the future.  A strong performance could
easily cause problems for the remainder of this year as Washington tries to
sort out the QB position.  WRs Albert Connell and James Thrash are both
listed as probable and should be good to go. At this point in the year,
nobody is 100%.  RB Larry Centers does such a nice job catching the ball out
of the backfield that TE Stephen Alexander has been ineffective.
