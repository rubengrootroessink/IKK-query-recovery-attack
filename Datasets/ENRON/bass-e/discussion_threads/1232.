 Player Updates?NBA Reports?=20
 Latest NBA Player News=20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=
is=20
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely," said Marbury. "I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable."  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20
