I could have told you that...it's just like anywhere else...the dumber they 
are...the better looking they are...Texas lets in like 200,000 people a 
year...and most of them are dumb ass chicks...did you notice all of those 
schools are PUBLIC!  Don't worry Hoskins...we know where the real women are!
