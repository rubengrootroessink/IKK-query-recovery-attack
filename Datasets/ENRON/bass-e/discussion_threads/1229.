ELECTION INTEGRITY UPDATE:

Thanks again for your support,  we've now sent over 270,000
letters to Al Gore urging him to concede for the good of the
country.  Keep the heat on by spreading the word!

Hopefully, the U.S. Supreme Court will throw out the
unwarranted decision of the Florida Supreme Court to force
new recounts of the so-called "undervote."  I'd hate to think
of our next president being decided by Democrat activists
divining the intent of voters who didn't cast a clear vote.

Unfortunately, even if the Supreme Court rules against Al Gore
today or tomorrow, many of his supporters are urging that he
still refuse to concede.

In fact, the Washington Times reports that former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, wants the Gore camp to focus on persuading two or
three Republican electors to defect from Mr. Bush. That would
result in a tie in the Electoral College or even a win for
Mr. Gore.

Here is what Mr. Cuomo had to say:

"There's no guarantee that three or four electors who were
previously supposed to vote for Bush wouldn't turn around, out
of anger and confusion, perhaps, and say, we're going to go
with Al Gore," he said.

Mr. Cuomo openly suggested that if Mr. Gore loses the U.S.
Supreme Court case, the next step for Democrats "could be to
convince some electors previously thought to be committed to
Bush. You only need three to make Al Gore president, even if
he loses Florida. Think about that."

My friend, regardless of whether or not Al Gore officially
supports these actions, there will likely be many attempts to
sway individual electors to overturn the certified election
results.

Political pundits have suggested that if the Supreme Court rules
against him, Al Gore will end the contest of the election
results but will NOT fully concede.  That's not enough.  America
NEEDS a full concession from Al Gore so that we can finally
move on.

But -- as long as Al Gore thinks he has enough public support --
there's no telling how long he'll drag this thing out.  That's
why we are going to keep hammering away with our public call for
Mr. Gore's to concede.

Please continue to send your friends, family and anyone who will
listen to our call for action to sign their letter to Al Gore at

For Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
