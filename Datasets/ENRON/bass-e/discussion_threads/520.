              CALLING ALL TEXANS

Texas E-Rangers:

WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP!!!  Gore Democrats are still attacking
Texas and lying about Governor Bush's record of success.

  We need Texas E-Rangers to choose a site below, sign up, and start
  posting pro-Bush content!

THESE SITES STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PRO-BUSH TRAFFIC!
SIGN ON AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  E-Rangers have already
turned the tide on several sites.  Let's turn these around, too.
