Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men
and women who fought it, you might like to know about two recent
releases: "Our Finest Hour: The Triumphant Spirit of America's
World War II Generation" and Andy Rooney's "My War." These two
books, along with three related history titles, are now available
at 40% off. You can order your copies by following the links below:

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers
and photographers during World War II. "Our Finest Hour" features
the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

And, save 40% on these popular World War II-related titles:
