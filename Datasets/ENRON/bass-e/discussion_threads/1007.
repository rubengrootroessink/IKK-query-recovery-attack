=09I received several responses to an e-mail from a reader last week regard=

UT's uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them. Here are some o=
f=20
the responses ...=20
=09
=09 =20
=09
=09One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their =
=20
uniforms. I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the  classiest=
,=20
coolest uniforms in the country! I admit to being biased, but  love the=20
simple, non-busy look of the all-white uniforms. I also have no  problem wi=
th=20
the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested. The  white helmets=
=20
with the simple, yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as  pronounced a=
s=20
the "star" on the Dallas Cowboys' helmet. While I agree with him about the=
=20
black shoes, I think any changes to "individualize" or  otherwise change=20
their "look" would be a move in the wrong direction. - Rick Peurifoy=20
=09
=09 I was interested in John Pharr's comments about the UT uniforms. Having=
 been=20
at UT in the 1960s, I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go. I=
=20
certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenc=
ed=20
by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans=20
individual name on back and "TEXAS" on the front), with the plain white pan=
ts=20
and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but=
=20
the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the=20
"candy-striped" pants (ala OU) and added the "TEXAS" to the jersey.=20
Personally I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings=
=20
would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One=
=20
amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the=
=20
uniforms; his response was that these are "work clothes" and not intended t=
o=20
be fancy. I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac=
k=20
a long way. I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the=
=20
Longhorn in the early 1960s, but it didn't add much. Keep up the good work.=
 I=20
always enjoy your newsletter. - Tom Thornell=20
=09
=09 Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are amo=
ng=20
the sharpest anywhere. If we change the helmets, then we look like a high=
=20
school team. What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are=
=20
orange and white. Period. So what if it doesn't have too much color? I hope=
=20
we stay exactly the same. Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an=
d=20
added orange pants? They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field.=

=09Q: I'm very happy for Chris Simms, but what should we expect from him no=

seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt, although one could argue=
=20
that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year. Stil=
l,=20
since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank=
ed=20
after five passes, a redshirt seems like a reach. If he doesn't redshirt,=
=20
what is=20
=09
=09the best guess for Texas QB in 2001? I know that you get asked this ever=
y=20

e are=20
starting fresh in this story.=20
=09?? Kyle Moore=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Simms' big-time performance against A=02?adds all kinds of new =
wrinkles=20
to the landscape for 2001. My best guess is Simms will get the start for th=
e=20
bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this=
=20
season. Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again=
=20
gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into t=
he=20
spring and next fall. Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a=
=20
rotation again. But one would have to think after the sluggish start the=20
offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be=20
reluctant to do that again. Despite breaking nearly every passing record at=
=20
Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his las=
t=20
outings before getting injured. Simms would seem to have everything going h=
is=20
way. The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie=
r=20
this season. Now that they've seen it, you would have to think that they wa=
nt=20
to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw=
o=20
years (not stick with a guy who only has one season left). I'm not saying=
=20
that's fair. But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would=20
think. But we won't know how the QB situation for 2001 will shake out until=
=20
next fall, most likely.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning, UT cou=

have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full. Do y=
ou=20
think B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on?=

Did they just blossom during the A=02?game? Otherwise, why haven't they see=
n the=20
field more?=20
=09?? A.B.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, bu=
t you=20
could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year=
=20
with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha=
ve=20
back at those positions. There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t=
he=20
fullback position was pretty average this season. So the coaches will take =
a=20
strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB. At 6-3 and 235, he has the=
=20
size. He is also quick with good hands. If Matthews doesn't add significant=
=20
oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more=
=20
one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field. But we'll see. UT coaches=
=20
did a nice job of adjusting this season to a two-back, two-receiver set aft=
er=20
they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers (with too many=
=20
formations and too many quarterbacks). Now that the receivers can probably=
=20
handle more of the playbook, look for UT to be as multiple and complex an=
=20
offense as possible next season. B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team=
's=20
second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty. Sloan Thomas was the o=
ne=20
who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions=
=20
and be ready to fill in at any of them. So he was slowed by the learning=20
process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and=20
Brandon Healy. Healy is a senior, so he'll be gone next year. Flowers shoul=
d=20
be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are=
=20
either redshirting or transferred?=20
=09?? Bart Fields=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the=
=20
sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer=
=20
Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan). Simms said=
=20
both will really help the team a lot next year. Jeffery is 6-2 and trying t=
o=20
bulk up from 170 pounds. Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170=20
pounds. But both have shown great hands in practice. The first two names th=
at=20
jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl=
=20
practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and=
=20
Rashad Thomas. With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'And=
re=20
Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new=
=20
faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at=
=20
linebacker in two years.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm a little concerned about our running backs. Next year's crop loo=
ks=20
mighty inexperienced. We never seemed to be able to run up the middle=20
consistently this year. Who would you figure has the best shot at being an=
=20
inside bruiser? What role will our fullbacks play? =20
=09?? Russell Phillips=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It's the biggest question mark on an offense that should be=20
absolutely loaded next season. I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis=
=20
and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov=
er=20
at tackle nicely. Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar=
r=20
has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good. So with a line=
=20
that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run=
=20
behind it. Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges=
=20
Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility. Coaches want Victor Ike, Ken=
ny=20
Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up. Coaches have told those=
=20
three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next=

=09 BROWN:  Don't be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season.=
 At=20
6-3 and more than 200 pounds, he is a bit undersized but could add the=20
