Quarterbacks in the  News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is  still hurting a 
tad with thumb and rib injuries.? He is listed as probable  on the injury 
report.? His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a  shoulder injury.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jake Plummer  (Ari) looks to start with the sore ribs 
but understand that one good  shot could send him out of the game a la 
Charlie Batch Thursday night.? Be  careful here.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the  season.
 

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making  excellent progress, but he will likely miss 
again this week.? Shane  Matthews is expected to get the start this week.? 
Cade is listed as  questionable with a sore shoulder.? He would probably play 
if Matthews were  to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter  despite a sore 
knee.? He practiced on Wednesday.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Scott Mitchell  (Cin)?looked good again in practice 
Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the start which is good news 
for his  teammates.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses  his ribs.? 
The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will  look to 
Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.? Either way,  look for 
Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.
?
*** Saturday Update? Cleveland QBs.? Coach Chris  Palmer will reportedly wait 
until gametime to decide between QBs Doug Pederson  and Spergon Wynn.? What a 
choice.? I'm fairly confident you're not  starting either if you're with me 
still in week 14...

QB Clint Stoerner  was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return  the last week of the NFL season at 
the earliest.? Gus Frerotte will start  in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and  is expected to take 
the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC)  practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable 
whether he will start.?  The coaching staff has yet to name a starter.? I 
rate his chances at 85% to  start.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Elvis Grbac (KC) has been  named the starter.? He 
says the finger feels fine and he's good to  go.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks  like he 
will start this Sunday.? He is listed as questionable on the injury  report 
with a sore shoulder and neck.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jay Fielder (Mia) has looked good  (or at least as 
good as he ever looks) in practice and looks to start  Sunday.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.? He  appears as 
questionable on the injury report again with a? sore thumb and a  bruised 
ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that 
to keep him  off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or  two for a more 
durable body.? He appears on the injured list again as  questionable with a 
sore knee.? Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,? will  start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for  the injured Brock Huard.? 
Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney  and was just released from 
the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner  (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice.? 
He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.? 
He is listed as questionable on  the injury report with a hurt thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind  center while Jeff George watches.? I 
doubt we have seen the last of this  controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running  backs in the News:
*** Saturday Update? RB Thomas Jones (Ari) has been  deactivated for this 
week's game as he's still recovering from  pneumonia.??? More work for 
Michael Pittman.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  practice briefly on Wednesday and is 
questionable for this week's game.? He  is having troublemaking the hard cuts 
so will likely be ineffective even if he  plays.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Sammy Morris (Buf) isn't looking  much better as we 
near kickoff.? I'm not expecting much of anything from  him this week.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB  Tshimanga?Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He 
is  listed as probable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a  setback this week 
and has been deactivated for Sunday's game.? Look for RB  Brad Hoover to get 
another start.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in practice Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is good news for his  teammates.
*** Saturday Update FB Nick Williams (Cin) ?likely  starts for Clif Groce 
Sunday.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.? Look for  Travis 
Prentice to "shoulder" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith  (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start this week.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.? Mike Anderson 
gets the  start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his  sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.? Ahman  Green will get the 
start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and  is expected to be the 
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury  report with a 
tender hamstring.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Lamar Smith (Mia) continues to look  good in practice 
and should be good to go.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is  probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as  questionable on the injury report with bruised 
ribs, but he expects to  play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.? He  may now be 
ready for the last game of the regular season.? His cast is  expected to come 
off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore neck.? He is still expected  to start though, but Chad Morton may see a 
few more reps than usual.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Jerald Moore (NO) was upgraded to  probably after a 
good practice Thursday and looks to start.

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.? He is listed as 
probable  with a sore gluteus.? I am guessing he is the butt of many New 
York  jokes.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) apparently is  better with a week 
to heal and should be able to make a bigger contribution this  week.? 

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will  return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and  finger, but his 
ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring 
Thursday and is?was listed as questionable.? He  did do some work Saturday 
and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this  week and he is using the time to 
look for personalized items with his last  name.? We will keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.? On a 
team that already has a crowded  backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell 
Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could  be placed on the inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a  broken rib, but is expected to play with the 
pain.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) practiced  again Friday and 
looks to start Sunday.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed  as questionable on the injury report, but 
is doubtful he would have played  anyway.? The team remains cautious in his 
comeback.

RB Mike Alstott  (TB) will not play this week.? Look for Warrick Dunn to get 
plenty of  opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten)  skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects to practice 
today and play this  weekend.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten) looked good in  practice Friday and 
will start.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his  sore forearm.? Look for the Giants 
to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.  
*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.? 

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in  the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore  leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to  play with 
a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this  week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he  injured 
in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play  with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore  groin.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Donald Hayes (Car)?was able to  practice Friday and is 
still looking like a go for Sunday.? Watch for the  snow however.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was  released from the hospital 
after spending a few days keeping an eye on his  back.? He's been downgraded 
to doubtful and I'm really not looking for  anything from this weekend.? He'd 
been struggling with QB Shane Matthews  anyway.? I'd look elsewhere if you 
can.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Marty Booker (Chi) looks to see  more playing time 
with Robinson's back troubles.?
?
*** Saturday Update?WR Peter Warrick  (Cin)?? QB Scott Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in  practice Friday and is now probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is  good news for his teammates.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.? He 
did not practice on Wednesday.

WR  Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.? Johnnie Morton and Herman  
Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more  time on the injury report than Yancey 
Thigpen...well maybe not, but he can't  stay healthy either.? Corey misses 
another game this week as he is  officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and  is listed as questionable on 
the injury report.? He says he will be ready  to play though.
?
*** Saturday Update WR E.G. Green (Ind) did not improve  this week and has 
been deactivated.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable  with a sore toe.? With Tony Martin now 
healthy, the team will likely rest  OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore leg, but he expects to play.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Troy Brown (NE) ?was able to  do some work Saturday 
but still isn't 100%.? He'll probably be the # 3 WR  if he can go Monday.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than  his listing on the injury 
report.? Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing  good enough to hold onto 
the starting jobs even if Jake were to get  healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.? Joe  Jurevicius will 
start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start  over Laveranues Coles who is out with a 
twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins  (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but 
even if he played he would  likely be ineffective.? Hines Ward has been the 
only Pittsburgh receiver to  do anything consistently all year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to  play, but he keeps talking like he 
will be on the field though.? He was  quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying 
he is 85% right now.? I am guessing  he is closer to 70%, but he probably 
will play if he can handle the pain from  his turf toe.
*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice  again Friday and 
looks like he'll be the # 3 WR behind Jerry Rice and J.J.  Stokes.? It's 
tough not to start him as he's always got the potential to  explode but he's 
a big risk.? If you need sure points this week, I'd shy  away from him.? If 
you really need help and you're looking for a home run,  you might take a 
chance on him but just be prepared for the chance he does  little.
?
*** Saturday Update? St. Louis WRs?will likely  be playing on a less than 
optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking at 
possible snow.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR  Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.? Even 
if  he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert  Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his 
condition.? He  remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to 
whether he plays.?  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he 
may have limited value  even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh,  but is expected to play this 
week.?  

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the  News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is  expected to play with a 
sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) looked good in  practice later this 
week and will likely get the start.

TE Shannon Sharpe  (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore  knee.? Fantasy players are 
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player  in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore  quadriceps.? He was 
limited in practice, but expects to play in the  game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this  weekend.? He 
is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as  questionable on the 
injury report with a sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Jackie Harris (Dal) did practice  and looks good for 
Sunday.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and  just did not catch a pass last 
week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.? If  Grbac plays, expect him to get 
the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin  (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. 

TE Johnny  McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.? John Davis still gets a lot 
of looks  though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.  

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.? But  he has looked 
like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes  before 
game-time.? Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the  players 
to start working through the pain.? I rate Wilkins chance to start  at close 
to 90% this week.
