Grab Gus Frerotte!
?
As a followup to our followup today on Griese,  ESPN's John Clayton has 
more.? He's reporting that backup QB Gus Frerrotte  has been told he needs to 
be ready to play for the rest of the season.?  
?
Don't panic yet as it'll be a couple of days still  before they know exactly 
what they're dealing with. But the bottom line is this  seems to be getting 
worse by the minute.
?
I'm not a?huge Frerotte fan but if he winds up  starting, he'll be handed the 
keys to one of the more prolific offenses in the  league.? Between Mike 
Shanahan and Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubiak,  that's a great brain trust.? 
A healthy Terrell Davis, 2 great WRs and 3 TEs  that are all effective make 
for a nice system.
?
We'll stay on this for you.

Here's the full article from ESPN's Clayton for  more detail.?

While not issuing an update on the injury Tuesday,  the Denver Broncos were 
fearful enough of losing quarterback Brian Griese because of his separated  
throwing shoulder that they told backup Gus Frerotte to be ready to play the  
rest of the season, ESPN.com's John Clayton reported.
?
Griese's injury is officially listed as a separated  AC joint. The Broncos 
said Tuesday they aren't likely to know about their  quarterback's 
availability for Sunday's game against San Diego until later in  the week. 

Griese was injured in the first quarter of  Denver's 27-24 win over Oakland 
on Monday night, but he returned to the lineup  and helped engineer the 
victory. 

"We won't know for a couple of days the exact  extent of the injury," coach 
Mike Shanahan said. "We'll wait to see how sore he  is." 

Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said Griese could be out  a "significant period of 
time," adding, "It looks bad." 

Asked after the game if he expected to play  against the Chargers, Griese 
said, "I don't know. I can't tell you what's going  to happen, what my 
availability will be for next week. I've never had an injury  like this, but 
I'm going to do my best to come back and play." 

Griese already was playing with torn cartilage in  the same shoulder, which 
will require off-season surgery. He insisted the two  injuries are unrelated.
