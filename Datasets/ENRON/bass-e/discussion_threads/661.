Hi Folks,
?
Careening toward the week 11 games as we try to  keep you on top of all the 
latest happenings.
?
Before we jump to this week's Updated Players in  the News, I wanted to let 
you know we've updated the Target  numbers.? Understanding how many times a 
player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how 
an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.? You can find the WR targets 
here http://www.cheatsheets.net/wrtargets.htm?and  the TE numbers here 
http://www.cheatsheets.net/tetargets.htm??  Enjoy.
?
Joe

News galore....let's jump into  it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl)  is doubtful with a concussion. He has not practiced 
all week. QB Danny  Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is  expected to sit another week with a sore shoulder. 
Doug Flutie gets the start  again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will  not play this week. Jim 
Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug  Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give him 
the  quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal)  practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected 
to start this  week. If he cannot go because of his back, Cliff Stoerner 
would start. Randall  Cunningham is also hurt with a sore knee and has not 
practiced.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Coach Dave Campo says he'll wait 
until Sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.? We expect it to be 
Aikman, but given this  uncertainty, I'd look elsewhere for a QB.
?
QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to  play through his ailments. This week will 
be no different.

QB  Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is expected  to 
start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is  expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to team, 
Maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not  appear on the injury report, but has a 
sore knee. He is expected to start this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and  did not practice on 
Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play  or not. John 
Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could also  use 
Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a situation you should  
avoid if at all possible.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)  continues to draw conflicting 
information. Some say he's looking a  little more likely to start Sunday.? 
Others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.? Even 
if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.? I'd look 
elsewhere if you can.

QB  Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played through  it 
the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh  (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not start. The 
team named  Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard  (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected to sit 
this  week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL)  is out for another 2-3 weeks.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Kurt Warner  (StL)? St. Louis Post Dispatch is 
reporting Warner will have the  pins removed from his finger Tuesday.? 
Remember early on that Warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were 
removed.? Most feel that's way too  optimistic but expect to hear a lot about 
this soon.

QB Shaun  King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday. He  
practiced on Thursday. 

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will  likely be added today to the injury report with a 
sore back. He expects to play  on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this  week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

Running Backs  in the News:

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore  knee. He did not practice 
on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo  (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) will likely play although 
Sam Gash will be the  starter.? Keep an eye on Ayandbadejo as he quietly had 
some very productive  weeks early in the season.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf)  returned to practice and will play this week.

RB  Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to play  
with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka's (Car) outlook has dimmed?a 
little as he was  downgraded to Questionable.? He wasn't able to practice any 
this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.? If he can't go, Brad 
Hoover will  start at Tailback.? Yes, that would be the undrafted Fullback 
Brad  Hoover...

RB Brandon Bennett (Cin) is healthy enough to  play this weekend. He will 
backup Corey Dillon.

RB Jamel White  (Cle) is expected to cut into Travis Prentice's carries this  
week.

needed.

Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets  continue to list 100 players on 
the injury report. He will start on  Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles  and was held out of 
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week,  but looks as if 
he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-time  decision which 
is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will keep you posted  regarding 
any breaking news regarding his status.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Tyrone  Wheatley (Oak) was unable to practice 
Saturday according to ESPN's John  Clayton.? He could still play Monday as 
he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.? I'm very leery though.? If I 
had another comprable  back, I'd go there this week.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is  expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but isexpected to start

first appearance this week.?  I'll be interested to see how he affects 
Watson's playing time.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a  sore hamstring, but expects to play. He is 
listed as questionable on the injury  report.

RB Eddie George (Ten) is banged up with a sore  knee and toe. But look for 
the iron-man to suit and play on Sunday.
?

through today and looks to start.?  

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will use the bye week to heal  his sprained wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

Wide  Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore  hamstring, but is expected to play. 

WR Tim Dwight (Atl)  will be downgraded to questionable on Friday's injury 
report. He has  sore ribs and could be a game-time decision.

year.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal) gets another start with Taylor 
gone.?  

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

WR  Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore  hamstring.

WR David Patten (Cle) has not practiced and  is doubtful this week.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle)  practiced on Wednesday despite being listed as

?
*** Saturday Update WR Darrin Chiaverini  (Cle) will miss Sunday's game.

WR Raghib Ismail (Dal)  has a torn ACL and is lost for the year.

WR Chris Cole  (Den) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

WR Germane  Crowell (Det) will not play this week. He is recovering from a 
broken  foot.

WR Desmond Howard (Det) missed Wednesday's  practice, but isexpected to play 
this week.

WR Corey Bradford  (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad strain. He 
has not  practiced and is doubtful for this week.

this week. Coach  Mora has stated that E.G. Green will see more playing time 
this  week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his  stiff neck and will play 
this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)  used the bye week to get healthier. He is expected to 
play this  week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia)  is expected to play this week with a sore foot. He will 
not start  though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be the  starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract  extension. "She" should be 
there for many years to come.

WR Jake  Reed (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

WR Ron Dixon  (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play  with his sore shoulder.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) is expected  to play with his sore back.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ)  will also return kickoffs after the team cut Kevin 
Williams.  

WR Charles Johnson (Phi) is expected to play with a  sore shoulder.

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea) was held out of  practice Wednesday and Thursday with a 
sore quadricep. He is listed as  questionable on the injury report.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  practiced Friday and looks like 
he'll play at least  some.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and  Thursday'spractices with a very 
tender toe. He's listed as questionable and  could be
a game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra  action if 
Owens can not go.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Terrell Owens  (SF) took part in about 70% of 
Friday's practice.? Coach Steve  Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not 
starting Owens Sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.? 
The amount he could play will be  determined by how Owens feels at gametime.? 
This is so tough to call as  he's one of the elite WRs in the game and 50% of 
Terrell Owens is better than  100% of lots of other WRs.? People always want 
numbers so here's my  opinion:? 
Chances he doesn't play at all:?  25%
Chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50%
Chances he plays and looks like the Owens we've  been seeing: 25%
Weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your 
team and situation.? He's a high risk, high  reward decision this week.? If 
you're pretty well set and just need a few  points out of your WR slot, I'd 
probably bench him and find another guy.?  If you need to swing for the 
fences, I'd probably be inclined to gamble on him  and keep your fingers 
crossed.? 

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the  least hurt of all the receivers and will start 
on Sunday. He is battling a sore  back and ankle. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten)  is listed as questionable on the injury report, but 
expects to start  with his sore back and ribs. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as 
questionable  this week. For those that have followed his career, this 
usually means he will  not play. 
?
***Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) surprised us and put together 3 
solid days of practice at the end  of the week.? Coach Fisher was even 
talking about the Titans taking some  shots downfield and Thigpen figuring 
into the gameplan.? We've heard this  before so be careful.? 

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is  still bothered by a hamstring and was not able to 
practice at full speed. He is  not likely to make much of an impact this week.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Carl Pickens (Ten)  is inactive for this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA)  was signed by  Washington.

Kickers in  the News:

kicking on Sunday.

PK Mike Vanderjagt (Ind)  inked a five year contract extension.

PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on Monday. He 
is listed  as questionable, but has not practiced. The Raiders have looked at 
Brett Conway  and Chris Boniol, but have not signed either one. We will watch 
this one close  for you Friday and Saturday.
?
*** Saturday Update? PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) is still not 100%.? He 
tested his foot today and  according to ESPN's John Clayton, the results were 
less than encouraging.?  He may still go but I'd look elsewhere this week.

Wilkens if he can't  kick.
