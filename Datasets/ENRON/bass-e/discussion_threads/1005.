A guy brings his girlfriend back to her home after being out on a date.
They reach the
front door, he leans with one hand on the wall, looks into her eyes and
says, "Sweetie,
why don't you give me a blow job?"
"What? You're crazy!" she replies.
"Don't worry, it will be quick, no problem!"
"No!! Someone may see; a relative, a neighbor..."
"At this time of the night, no one will show up," he adds.
"I've already said NO, so NO!"
"Honey, it's just a small blowie, I know you'll like it too!"
"NO!!! I've said NO!!!"
"My love, don't be like that, come on!"
At this moment the girls sister shows up at the door in her nightgown
with her hair totally
in disorder, rubbing her eyes and says, "Dad says either You have to
blow him, I have to
blow him, or He will come down and give him a blow job himself, but for
God's sake, tell
your boyfriend to take his hand off the intercom!"
