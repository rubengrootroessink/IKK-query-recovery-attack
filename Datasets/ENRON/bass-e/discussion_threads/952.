Hi  Folks,

I gotta say  before I get started that Monday Night Football=01,s =01&Pack"=
 and=20
"Cats=018 in the  scoring box was one of the more annoying moves they=01,ve=
 made=20
this season.? =01&Cats=018?? That=01,s so  lame.

Enough of that,  let's jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded  Players=
.?=20
As we head down the home stretch, identifying those  players moving up or=
=20
down can be the difference between making the playoffs or  watching from th=
e=20
sidelines.? As we  head into our 14th week of listing these players, it=01,=
s=20
inevitable  that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade=
=20
list.? Make sure you understand, what we=01,re  talking about is players th=
at=20
are moving.?  In other words, a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on t=
he=20
downgrade  list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league.? I=
t=20
just means I=01,m concerned about the  way he seems to be heading.?  Likewi=
se, a=20
player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even  though he=01,=
s=20
still fairly far down the list of WRs.? It=01,s all about which direction=
=20
players  are moving.? Keeping an eye on these  trends can very often make a=
ll=20
the difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit)? Time to give props where props are  due.? Kordel=
l=20
looks like a new  man.? Actually, he looks like the  old Kordell.? The GOOD=
=20
old Kordell.  Over the last three weeks, he ranks as the # 5 QB in my=20
Performance / TD system  based on FF points per game.? Gotta  hand it to Bi=
ll=20
Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting? WRs like that but Hines=
=20
Ward has  delivered.? It=01,s probably not the  best thing for Jerome Betti=
s=20
owners but Stewart=01,s 3 rushing TDs over the last 3  weeks are huge.?

QB Aaron  Brooks (NO)? Brooks made my upgrade list last week  and I put my=
=20
money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league  to pick=
=20
him up? last week as a free  agent.? I said last week that we=01,d  see how=
 he=20
does with the pressure on all week.? Obviously, this is one cool kid.? If y=
ou=20
saw the footage of him in the  tunnel before the game he looked like he was=
=20
ready to go out and play a game of  flag football or something.? He made =
=20
some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times.? The obvious=20
comparison is a young  Randall Cunningham.? He=01,s skinny and  has a littl=
e bit=20
of those Cunningham crazy legs.? Plus he=01,s got a big arm with that whipp=
y =20
motion.? But the biggest thing that  impresses me about Brooks is his poise=
.?=20
 Grab him if he=01,s available in your league.?

I asked my  friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks.?=
=20
Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun  King before the draft. Here=01,s wha=
t the=20
1999 TFY Draft Preview had for  Brooks:? =20

AARON BROOKS  Virginia 6'3" 210 4.71

Fifth year senior who completed 54% of his passes  throwing for 2,319 yards=
,=20
12 touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the  ball 83 times for 23=
2=20
yards, averaging 2.8 yards per carry with five more  scores.? Led the ACC i=
n=20
passing efficiency two seasons ago, throwing for  57% / 2,282 / 20 / 7.? Go=
od=20
athlete who has shown great improvement in his  quarterback skills the last=
=20
season and a half.? Smooth and fluid, sets his  feet in the pocket, shows=
=20
good strength and stands his ground when being  rushed.? Has a live arm; ca=
n=20
thread a needle, throws ropes and his deep  passes have speed.? Effective=
=20
throwing on the run, squares his shoulders  and quickly releases the ball.=
=20
Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers, pulls the  ball down, running betwee=
n=20
the tackles.? While he has improved his accuracy  and places his passes wel=
l,=20
he often overthrows receivers.? The further  down the field or out to the=
=20
flanks he must get the ball, the more his accuracy  struggles.? Must do a=
=20
better job reading and recognizing defenses, stop  staring down his primary=
=20
target and not hold the ball so long while in the  pocket.? A player who=20
turned himself into a good prospect with a solid  senior campaign.? Mid to=
=20
late Sixth Round.?

Thanks  Tony.? Be sure to check out Tony=01,s  great info at=20
www.TFYDraftPreview.com?

QB Kurt  Warner? (StL)?? Warner=01,s chomping at the bit and has been named=
 the =20
starter this week relieving Trent Green.?  Keep an eye out on how he looks =
in=20
practice.? Coach Mike Martz said last week he was  concerned about Warner=
=01,s=20
grip strength and ability to put rotation on the  ball.? I=01,m thinking he=
=01,ll=20
be good to  go.?

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? What  else can you say about this guy??  Take awa=
y=20
his running game??  No problem.? Give him WRs  that would? struggle to make=
=20
a  division I team? ?No problem.? He finds a way to get it done.? He looks =
to=20
me like he=01,s beginning to  reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at=20
Syracuse where he was  unstoppable.? It=01,s especially  impressive as team=
s=20
know what he=01,s going and still can=01,t stop him.? It should be noted th=
at=20
LaVarr Arrington  was injured early and he was the designated =01&spy=018 b=
ut=20
still, it was an  impressive performance against a very good Washington=20
defense.? I see little reason why he won=01,t  continue although he really =
needs=20
help at WR.?

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer  might pla=
y=20
the late season 1999 Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives  anothe=
r=20
struggling? QB=01,s  career.? Dilfer seems very  comfortable with what Bill=
ick=20
is asking him to do and brings a little fire and  attitude to the offense=
=20
that had been missing.? I like what they=01,re doing and don=01,t see  why =
it won=01,t=20
continue.? Although  don=01,t forget they=01,re off this week.



QB Brad  Johnson (Was)? Jeff George yields to the young man from  Florida=
=20
State.? His knee is  reportedly good to go and he=01,s been cleared by the=
=20
trainers as fit to  start.? Considering the troubles the  team endured with=
=20
George at the helm, Johnson has already been named the  starter.? He=01,ll =
be=20
working with a  nicked WR corps so we=01,ll see how he fares.?

QB Ryan Leaf  (SD)? Kordell Stewart, Trent Dilfer and Ryan  Leaf?? You gott=
a=20
be kidding me.? But after another solid outing, you  can=01,t deny Leaf is=
=20
making plays.?  Granted, he still throws the ugly interception(s) and he ge=
ts=20
hurt almost  as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for=
=20
you if you need a  spot QB.? He=01,s got one of the top 3  TEs in the game =
with=20
Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are  veterans who can make =
a=20
difference.?  This win will have to buoy the spirits and  enthusiasm.

??

RBs Moving Up?

RB Mike  Anderson (Den)? Once is a coincidence.? Twice is a trend. You=01,v=
e got=20
to start  handing credit to Mike Shanahan, Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia=
k,=20
and that  offensive line. Like everyone else, I marveled at the way Olandis=
=20
Gary was able  to run last year when Terrell Davis went down.? What a great=
=20
job of scouting we all  thought.? But hey, Gary was a pretty  highly touted=
=20
back.? But Mike  Anderson???? Anderson=01,s a  fine back but I=01,ve got to=
 believe=20
it=01,s a team deal here.? The good news is that Anderson=01,s team  isn=01=
,t going=20
anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell  Davis=
=20
recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment.? Watch this during the week, b=
ut=20
it  wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game. ?And as l=
ong=20
as Anderson rolls up 195  rushing yards a game like he did Sunday, you won=
=01,t=20
see Shanahan crying over TD  being out.? Granted 80 of those  yards came on=
=20
one big run but he had a great game any way you slice  it.?

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? I=01,ve been eating crow (Raven?) for a  while now a=
s I=20
was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at  this level=
=20
after a very disappointing 1999 season at Tennessee.? Lewis is running like=
=20
he did as a  Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have=
=20
the best blend of  speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George.=
?=20
Coach Brian Billick has the Raven  offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi=
s=20
remains a huge part of it.? His only down side is that he=01,s off this  we=
ek=20
with a bye.? But that week 16  matchup against Arizona is looking very=20
tasty=01(?

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? Considering what he does with that  surrounding cas=
t,=20
I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back  in the NFL.?=
=20
There have been few  passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the=20
Bengals, yet Dillon  continues to pound out the yards when defenses know=20
exactly what=01,s coming at  them.? It=01,s amazing to watch.? I don=01,t k=
now how=20
long he can keep it up  but he=01,s got the woeful Cardinals this week and =
you=20
have to like  that.?

RB Warrick  Dunn (TB)? Dunn made the upgrade list last week in  the wake of=
=20
Mike Alstott=01,s knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his  owners=
=20
Sunday with 129 total yards including 2 TDs.? There was some talk about him=
=20
sharing  carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the=
=20
ball for Tampa  Bay.? Look for more of the same from  the Bucs and new=20
offensive coordinator Warren Sapp=01(? Seriously, Dunn showed he could hand=
le =20
20 rushing attempts and I think you=01,ll continue to see them go with what=
=01,s =20
working.? =20



RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman may be the lone bright spot on  the=20
Arizona team.? I told you last  week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and=
=20
you saw the results last night as  Pittman rambled for 77 yards on only 13=
=20
carries (5.7 ypc)? Like Corey Dillon, the surrounding team  kills his value=
=20
but if he ran for a team that held a lead, he=01,d be awesome.? Unfortunate=
ly, I=20
don=01,t see Arizona  turning into such a team anytime soon so don=01,t get=
 too=20
excited.? But overall, I like the guy a  lot.?

RB Richie  Anderson (NYJ)? Each year, there are always unheralded  guys who=
=20
post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners.? Many tim=
es=20
they are RBs who quietly post  yardage (and FF points) receiving the ball.?=
=20
Anderson is a prime example of one such  player this year (as?are Tony=20
Richardson and Stanley Pritchett)? He=01,s caught 15 passes over the last 3=
 =20
games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus, that trend wil=
l =20
likely continue.???

RB Robert  Holcombe (StL)? It doesn=01,t take a rocket scientist to  see th=
at=20
Marshall Faulk isn=01,t 100%.?  Red flags went up across the country when M=
ike=20
Martz elected to give  Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday.?  6 weeks=
=20
ago, that would have been Faulk=01,s carry all day long.? Holcombe looks to=
=20
benefit if Faulk=01,s  workload continues to be decreased.? =20



RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? Aside from having one of those cool  names the fans=
=20
can yell whenever he does something good, Hoover has shown to be  a capable=
=20
replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka.? He doesn=01,t have the=20
physical tools of a  Biakabutuka but you can=01,t deny he hasn=01,t been=20
effective.? It wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see  Hoover continue to see=
=20
action.

WRs Moving Up

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Harrison stated before Sunday=01,s game  that he=
=20
needed to =01&get on a mission=018.?  Looked like he started towards that e=
nd with=20
2 TD catches and he could  have had another.? Yes, you=01,d like  to see mo=
re=20
than 4 catches but I=01,ll take 2 TDs any week.? Harrison=01,s biggest worr=
y is=20
that Peyton  Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for=
=20
dropping easy  balls.? Harrison is fine and  actually looking better in my=
=20
eyes.?

WR Hines  Ward (Pit)? Does anyone else find it interesting to  see Kordell=
=20
Stewart throwing the ball to another =01&slash=018 type player in Hines  Wa=
rd??=20
Ward doesn=01,t have the name of  a Plaxico Burress but he=01,s certainly m=
ore=20
productive.? If I=01,m Burress, I=01,d be for finding a  baseball cap that =
I was=20
comfortable with=01(?

WR Amani  Toomer (NYG)? Toomer=01,s back in a big way.? He had us worried t=
here=20
for a stretch  earlier but he=01,s playing very well right now, especially =
with=20
Ike Hilliard  out.? QB Kerry Collins has settled  into a nice rhythm and=20
coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a  playoff slot.?=
=20
Look for?Toomer  and Collins to be a big part of making that happen.



WR Sean  Dawkins (Ind)? With his size (6=01, 4=018 / 218 #) I=01,ve  always=
 wondered=20
why he isn=01,t better.?  He=01,s showing over the last few games that mayb=
e he=20
is.? Over the last 3 games, he rates as the #  5 WR in Fantasy Points per=
=20
game.? It  doesn=01,t seem to make a great deal of difference to him whethe=
r it=01,
s Jon Kitna or  Brock Huard throwing the ball, he just delivers.???

WR Peter  Warrick (Cin)Garbage time or not,  he scored another TD this week=
=20
and he=01,s a great gamble if you need to roll the  dice for a home run.? Y=
es,=20
he=01,s as  liable to go 2 for 18 as he is score a TD but sometimes, those =
are=20
the kinds of  gambles that pay big.? The team  reportedly was forcing him t=
o=20
see an eye doctor for contact lenses.? This could be like Charlie Sheen in =
=20
Major League with the new glasses.?  Seriously, if he=01,s had bad vision t=
hat=01,s=20
been limiting him, look out once  he gets the contacts.?

WR Joe  Jurevicius (NYG)? With Ike Hilliard out, Jurevicius got  all he eve=
r=20
wanted =01) a chance.? And  he=01,s making the most of it.? He=01,s  clearl=
y the #2 WR=20
behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking, the #2 guy  has definite=
=20
value.? Keep an eye on  Hilliard=01,s return but he could be a nice sub if =
you=01,
re in a  pinch.?

WR Willie  Jackson (NO)? Jackson is looking less =01&fluky=018 with  each g=
ame.??=20
He put together a  nice day Sunday with 4 catches for 64 yards.? Like=20
Jurevicius, he=01,s the clear cut # 2  receiver but he=01,s certainly valua=
ble.? =20
QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to =20
benefit.?

WR R. Jay  Soward (Jac)? I=01,ll be honest, I really don=01,t like  Soward =
much but=20
you can=01,t dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be  forcing the=
 ball=20
to him on the long throws.? He=01,ll draw the weaker coverage (and  rightly=
 so)=20
when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could  have=
=20
some mismatches.? =20

??

TEs Moving Up?

TE Freddie  Jones (SD)? Jones is still under the radar of a few  owners as =
he=20
plays for the Chargers.?  Truth is,? he=01,s one of the  better receivers i=
n the=20
game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego.? He=01,s a nice big tar=
get=20
with soft hands  for new QB Ryan Leaf.? He=01,s had 11  receptions over the=
 last=20
3 games.?

TE Jay  Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma=01,s returning to the player we  knew he=
=20
could be.? With 5 receptions  for 82 yards Sunday, he=01,s a vital part of =
the=20
offense. ?With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy  McDaniel not doing much, it=
=01,s=20
pretty much Eric Moulds and  Reimersma.



TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained  knee, LaFlu=
er=20
seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with 6  catches f=
or=20
45 yards and a TD.? Keep  an eye on Harris but this could be a trend.

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? Becht earns the upgrade just for the  beautiful=20
diving TD catch Sunday.?  At this point in the season, rookies aren=01,t re=
ally=20
rookies any more as  most have enough experience that they=01,re learning t=
he=20
ropes.? Becht appears to be a fast learner and  could give this team a huge=
=20
boost with solid TE  play.

??

QBs Moving Down?

QB Jeff  George (Was)? Audition time is over.? Didn't you have the feeling=
=20
owner Danny  Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor=
e=20
Brad Johnson  sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year (i=
f=20
they ever do  that)? Instead, he looked very  average and even a little bit=
=20
old.?  Brad Johnson will get the start this week.? You never know with knee=
=20
injuries so  George certainly still has value, just nothing like he did as =
a =20
starter.



QB Trent  Green (StL)? Chris Berman made a great point last  night on ESPN=
=01,s=20
Prime Time.? Trent  Green is a nice player but let=01,s forget this talk ab=
out=20
him being the same  player as Kurt Warner.??  Another loss for the Rams=20
pretty much guaranteed we=01,ll see Warner this  week.? The Rams are sudden=
ly =20
fighting for their lives and it won=01,t be Green behind center.?

QB Shane  Matthews (Chi)? The University of Florida has a great  program an=
d=20
always places a large number of players at the next level but  Matthews loo=
ks=20
to be another shot putting QB that simply can=01,t deliver the ball  at thi=
s=20
level.? It=01,s a testament to  coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise sys=
tems=20
to make guys like Matthews and  Danny Wuerffel look great in college becaus=
e=20
they clearly lack the talent.? Put it this way, Matthews has Bears fan =20
wishing Cade McNown will get back soon=01(



QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Whether it=01,s the thumb or the WRs or the  play=20
calling, Bledsoe is struggling.?  I used to blame this on Bill Belichick=20
coming up with a Jets defense that  shattered Bledsoe=01,s confidence and t=
hrew=20
him into a tailspin this time of year  but now I=01,ll have to start lookin=
g for=20
other theories.?? As Terry Glenn said, =01& it felt  like the defense knew=
=20
exactly what we were going to do=018.? That=01,s bad for a Thursday  game.

??

RBs Moving Down?

RB Emmitt  Smith? (Dal)? As you  probably saw, Emmitt was knocked out for a=
=20
moment during the Thanksgiving Day  game.? Check his status this  week.? Ev=
en=20
100%, he faces a tough  stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa=
=20
Bay, Washington, New York  Giants, and Tennessee.?

RB J.J.  Johnson (Mia)? Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early  indicatio=
ns=20
are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means  Johnso=
n=20
takes a seat.?

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? It looks to me like the Falcons are very  close t=
o=20
packing it in.? He may be  worth one more start against the porous Seattle=
=20
defense this week but after  that, he=01,s got a bye and then New Orleans.?

RB Marshall  Faulk (StL)? Understand, he=01,s still a top RB, but I think h=
is =20
value is clearly falling a bit.? He  looks less than 100% but the most=20
telling indicator by far was the Robert  Holcombe goalline carry.? 6 weeks =
=20
ago, no way does Holcombe get that carry.?  He=01,s still a must start and=
=20
Warner will likely help his stock but I=01,m a  little worried.?

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ)? The weather conditions made it tough to  get a tru=
e=20
picture of Martin=01,s health but it was pretty easy to see he wasn=01,t  1=
00%=20
Sunday.? Between Bernie  Parmalee and Richie Anderson, coach Al Groh has=20
plenty of options and he doesn=01,t  hesitate to go with them.?

RB Jermaine  Fazande (SD) ?The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher  and look=
s=20
to have lost his starting job.?  Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counti=
ng=20
on him for too much  anyway.

??

WRs Moving Down?

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten)? Drop this guy if you haven=01,t  already.? He mis=
ses=20
games with a  myriad of injuries and when he does see the field, he manages=
=20
to drop key  passes=01(?

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? One has to wonder what could have been  with Jim=
=20
Miller healthy.? Shane  Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a=
=20
whopping one time Sunday.? That will not do.?=20



WR Sylvester  Morris (KC)? Morris has been especially disappointing  as one=
=20
usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be =
=20
going the other way.? Over the last  3 weeks, he ranks as the # 81 WR in my=
=20
TD / Performance system.? Part of that can be attributed to Elvis  Grbac /=
=20
Warren Moon but he=01,s not playing well right now.?

WR Terance  Mathis (Atl)? Mathis ranks # 72 among WRs over the  last 3 game=
s=20
in my TD / Performance system.? That=01,s not what you=01,re looking for fr=
om  a #=20
1 WR, even if it is the Falcons.???

Eagle  WRs? These guys are just not very good.? I had especially high hopes=
=20
for Charles  Johnson this year but he=01,s not getting it done.???

WR Wayne  Chrebet (NYJ)? As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson  whining abou=
t=20
Chrebet not being a #1 WR, it looks he may have had a point.? Chrebet just=
=20
doesn=01,t have the speed or  physical size to make a? consistent  impact w=
hen=20
defenses choose to take him out of the game.? I love the guy and admire his=
=20
grit and  determination but he struggles against double coverage.? And most=
 #=20
1 WR face double  coverage=01(?

TEs Moving Down



TE Andrew  Glover (NO)? A rising tide is supposed to lift all  boats but=20
nobody told Glover about that little axiom.? The Saints continue to roll in=
=20
spite of  a virtually non existent TE.? =20



TE Jackie  Harris (Dal)? Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a  knee Sunda=
y=20
and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes.?=20



TE Ricky  Dudley (Oak)? He=01,s maybe the most frustrating player  in the g=
ame.?=20
