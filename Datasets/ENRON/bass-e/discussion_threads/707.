Hi Folks,

A couple of quick notes before we get to  this week=01,s Upgrades and Downg=
rades.

?

Replacing Ricky  Williams:?? Contrary to published reports,  Ricky Williams=
=20
bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to  ESPN.? The wor=
d=20
is that Jim Haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.? Chad=
=20
Morton and Jerald Moore will likely  be the choices with Morton getting fir=
st=20
shot.? Morton=01,s a little undersized at 5=01, 8=018  and 186 but so is Sa=
n=20
Francisco's Charlie Garner and he manages pretty  well.??Morton came from a=
=20
big  time program at USC and averaged 20+ carries a game last year so it=01=
,s=20
not like  he isn=01,t used to carrying the load.?  We=01,ll see.

Don=01,t Count Out Brett  Favre:? According to ESPN, Brett Favre=01,s foot =
is  much=20
better and he may practice this week.?  Even if he doesn't practice, he=20
thinks he may be able to play and keep his  record streak of consecutive=20
starts intact.

Akili Smith Benched.? Not  just benched.? Benched for Scott  Mitchell.? Tha=
t=01,
s gotta  hurt.

Marshall Faulk Raring to  Go?? With Trung Canidate out for the  year with a=
=20
broken wrist, Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl=
e=20
to play this week.? Most  think that=01,s too optimistic but it=01,s nice t=
o see=20
the desire there.?=20



Jeff George to  Start??According to the Redskins, Jeff George will start =
=20
again this week at QB.? Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is=
 =20
Brad?Johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?

?

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Mark  Brunell (Jac)?? I=01,m one of those guys who quickly  points out=
=20
Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he =20
receives but you can=01,t deny what Brunell has done lately.? Behind a beat=
 up=20
line, he=01,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th=
e=20
ball.? Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with Keenan McCardel=
l,=20
they=01,re one of the better WR tandems in the  league.? =20

QB Kerry  Collins (NYG)? A few weeks ago, I took some (deserved)  lumps for=
=20
my early praise of Collins but he=01,s kicking his game up a notch of  late=
.? He=20
looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=
=20
backs.? Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing  but when he=01,s healthy, T=
oomer=20
and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps.? A?solid ground game in Ron Dayne a=
nd=20
Tiki  Barber continue to help the passing game.

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? With  Deuce Staley gone, McNabb=01,s had to shoul=
der=20
the offense and this week he came  through with flying colors.? The bad  ne=
ws=20
is he only completed 47% of his passes Sunday.? The good news is he threw t=
he=20
ball 55  times.? When a QB airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn=01,t=
=20
usually bode well for the team=01,s chances of  winning but it=01,s certain=
ly a=20
plus for your FF team to see that many  attempts.? With that many chances, =
=20
it=01,s like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake (23 attempt=
s=20
this  week) or Jeff Garcia (25 attempts) puts up.? Unless you have a really=
=20
good feeling  about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry, I=01,d think you=01=
,ll see=20
him continue to  throw often.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)?? Remember, this list is  relative.? While he may no=
t=20
be a  starter, Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that=01,s what=
 this=20
list is  all about.? He actually looked very  good at times in the huge=20
victory over Tennessee Sunday.? He showed nice poise coming back after =20
basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier.? Brian Billick did=20
wonders with a  marginally talented Tony Banks in 1999 and it=01,s conceiva=
ble=20
he might do it here  again with Dilfer.? They play Dallas  and Cleveland ne=
xt=20
but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December  3.

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? When I=01,m bashing Mark Brunell as a  Fantasy QB, I=
=20
usually compare him to Troy Aikman =01) Great real NFL QB but not a  much f=
or=20
Fantasy GMs.? Notice a  pattern here?? After being named the  starter Sunda=
y,=20
Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked #  20 over t=
he=20
last 4 weeks.? It=01,s hard  to put too much faith in him but if you=01,re=
=20
desperate for a QB, he could be worth  a gamble.? Tough matchup this week  =
vs=20
Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week 13.

QB Jeff  Blake? (NO)? You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is =
=20
gone for 6-8 weeks.? I hate it for  Williams owners (I=01,m one) but what=
=01,s done=20
is done.? All we can do now is look forward.? And looking forward, I see=20
Blake being  forced to carry an increased load.?  QB Donovan McNabb threw t=
he=20
ball 55 times Sunday in the wake of losing RB  Deuce Staley and I could=20
easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with  Blake throwing a l=
ot=20
more passes.

QB Rob  Johnson (Buf)? I make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching=20
issues but I=01,ve gotta say I think Mr. Charisma with the Spiffy  Sweaters=
,=20
Wade Phillips, is 100% wrong in going to Johnson.? In terms of roster=20
management, he=01,s  hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion.? But no=
ne of=20
that really matters as Rob  Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=
=01,s=20
been named the starter for this  week.? Don=01,t get too excited,  though.?=
=20
Johnson finishes roughly  half the games he starts and the next three weeks=
=20
vs Kansas City, Tampa Bay and  Miami could be brutal.? =20

QB Matt  Hasselbeck (GB)? Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre  this=20
week.? Remember there was even  some talk about trading Favre and starting=
=20
Hasselbeck this summer when Favre=01,s  elbow was a big concern.? Before yo=
u =20
give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck, you should know Brett Favre is=20
reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.? We=01,ll keep you=
 =20
posted.

QB Shane  Matthews / Cade McNown (Chi)? Again, I=01,m highlighting guys mov=
ing =20
up.? With the injury to Jim Miller,  Shane Matthews will be thrust into the=
=20
starting role.? The injury will also likely add a little  fire under Cade=
=20
McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=
=20
Miller was performing well.?  Matthews looked very rusty but it=01,s tough =
to=20
judge a QB when he=01,s thrust  into the game like that.? I=01,d look  for =
Matthews=20
at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then  we=01,ll=
=20
see.? =20

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? You have to keep giving this guy his  props after=20
another great game.?  Although, if you=01,ve got an owner salivating over S=
mith=20
and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.? I=
=20
can=01,t imagine his value being any  higher.? His yard per carry number  d=
ipped=20
to 2.6 in Sunday=01,s game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal =
=20
matchup against Tampa Bay in week 15.? =20



RB Edgerrin  James (Ind)? It=01,s tough to upgrade a guy already near  the =
top=20
but he put in another great game Sunday with 155 total yards and shows =20
little sign of slowing down.? He  averaged 4.2? yards per carry Sunday  and=
=20
the Colts are leaning heavily on him.?  Watch out for a tough November 26=
=20
matchup vs Miami  though.

RB Robert  Smith (Min)? Smith quietly is having an incredible  year.? He=01=
,s=20
put those hang nail  injury jokes way behind him as he=01,s become one of t=
he=20
best RBs in the  league.? He=01,s running between the  tackles for the toug=
h=20
yards and catching the ball exceptionally well.? Keep an eye on that tasty=
=20
week 13  matchup against the Cowboys.? =20

RB Fred  Taylor (Jac)? Jaguar Fans may be distraught, but Fred  Taylor owne=
rs=20
have to be happy, at least lately.? Taylor=01,s running as well as he has i=
n =20
his career, even if his team is struggling.? One can only wonder what he=01=
,d be=20
doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?  He=01,s got two tough weeks coming=
=20
against Pittsburgh and Tennessee.? But as everyone knows, Taylor has a  gre=
at=20
stretch run of opponents in weeks 14-16 when he faces Cleveland, Arizona  a=
nd=20
Cincinnati.? =20

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? If you didn=01,t know better, you might  have tho=
ught=20
you were watching tape from 1998 if you saw Anderson Sunday.? He ran hard a=
nd=20
with the power and  quickness that pushed him to stardom.?? Hopefully, he=
=01,ll=20
be able to  maintain that form.

RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman=01,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke=
ep an=20
eye on that but assuming he=01,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.? He=
=20
scored a TD Sunday and  averaged 4.2 yards per carry on 12 carries.? He als=
o=20
added 8 receptions.? His main competition for carries, Thomas  Jones, had a=
=20
yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday:? 1.00???

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed  for 62=20
yards on 17 carries.??  He likely won=01,t be a factor long as Marshall Fau=
lk is=20
already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=
=20
one more  week.?

RB Ahman  Green (GB)? With Dorsey Levens=01, troubles, Green  clearly shoot=
s up=20
the charts.? He=01,s  an enormously talented RB, but he=01,s got to learn h=
ow to=20
turn that talent into on  the field production.? After a tough  Tampa Bay=
=20
game last Sunday, he faces a soft schedule with the Colts, Panthers,  Bears=
,=20
Lions and Minnesota coming up.



RB Chad  Morton (NO)? With Ricky Williams out for the next 6-8  weeks, the=
=20
logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC,  Morton.?=
=20
He=01,s Detroit WR Johnnie  Morton=01,s little brother and was reportedly e=
xtremely=20
close to Ricky Williams and  shaken with his injury.? He=01,s small  but ve=
ry=20
quick.? He=01,s not as big as  you=01,d probably like but neither is Charli=
e=20
Garner.? Last year at USC, he carried a full load  as the featured rusher s=
o=20
he=01,s capable.?  The team hasn=01,t announced their plans yet and bringin=
g in a=20
free agent is  a possibility but I=01,d expect Morton to get a shot first.?=
 New=20
Orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with Oakland, Denver=
,=20
San Francisco and Atlanta all  ahead.=20

??

WRs Moving Up

WR James  McKnight (Dal)? Wow.? What else can you say but give the man =20
credit.? 8 catches for 164 yards  with a TD is a pretty good day.?  Whether=
=20
he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik=
e=20
what he=01,s done thus far.?  He=01,s got a brutal matchup next week in Bal=
timore=20
but he might be worth  grabbing to play against the Vikings in week 13.?

WR Sean  Dawkins? (Sea)? Excuse  us for not getting excited about a guy who=
=20
was buried on the Seahawks a few  weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to=
=20
him.? But Kitna=01,s looking better and Dawkins  responded with a great gam=
e.?=20
Like  McKnight, the question is whether he can keep it up but he=01,s worth=
 a=20
roll of the  dice.?

WR Torry  Holt (StL)? I drew a few snickers a month ago when I  said I=20
thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans.? I=01,m just about rea=
dy to=20
call Torry Holt  the best WR in St. Louis.? And  that=01,s no knock on Isaa=
c=20
Bruce.?  Holt=01,s really coming into his own and to be honest, benefits gr=
eatly=20
from  the attention Isaac Bruce draws.? He  does face a couple of strong=20
defenses in Washington and New Orleans but I=01,m  betting he manages to pr=
oduce=20
against tough competition.?

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? Mason is clearly the best WR on the  team. Partly =
by=20
default as Kevin Dyson=01,s gone and Carl Pickens is injured.? But partly=
=20
because he=01,s just that  good.? The Titans had their running  game shut d=
own=20
by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air.? And much to the=20
surprise of many, QB  Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa=
rt=20
of that  success.?

WR Ricky  Proehl (StL)? Great, just what Fantasy GMs need =01)  Another Ram=
 WR=20
to worry about.?  Proehl caught 6 passes for 53 yards and a TD Sunday.? In =
an=20
offense missing RB Marshall Faulk  as high powered as the Rams, there=01,s=
=20
probably room for another WR at the  trough.???

WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal)? Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the  lineup an=
d=20
came up big with the game winning TD.? He only caught 3 passes but=20
understand  that he=01,s the 3rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q=
adry =20
Ismail.? Still though, it=01,s a Brian  Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl=
aying=20
better with each series it  seems.?

WR Jimmy  Smith? (Jac)???  With 10 catches for 117 yards, I guess you can s=
ay=20
he=01,s back.? The Jags may be struggling but Smith and  QB Mark Brunell ar=
e=20
back in synch.?  Ride it while the combo is hot.?

WR Jerome  Pathon (Ind)? Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the  #2 WR sp=
ot=20
early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there.? Pathon is=20
playing with more confidence  and more importantly, seems to have the=20
confidence of QB Peyton Manning.? He had 3 catches for 42 yards  Sunday.?

?

TEs Moving Up?

TE Bubba  Franks (GB)? For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone  Davis had=20
battled for time.? It=01,s  now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis =
is=20
seeing very little time.? Franks made a great catch of the fake  kick TD an=
d=20
is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers=01, eye in  the =
draft.

TE Rod  Rutledge (NE)? So much for Eric Bjornson.? Rutledge seems to be the=
=20
new TE threat  for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to=
=20
the TE.? If he can just get that thumb  healthy=01(?

TE Shannon  Sharpe (Bal)?? After some quiet weeks, Sharpe has  returned to=
=20
his place of one of the premier TEs in the game.? He=01,s clearly the best=
=20
receiver on the  team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer.? Just as=
=20
importantly, he seems to have  confidence in Dilfer.

???

QBs Moving  Down?

QB Trent  Green (StL)? Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he  felt that=
=20
having Green behind center was =01&just like having Kurt in there=018.? We =
believe=20
him.? If you=01,re going to deal him, now=01,s the  time.? Even as well as =
he=01,s=20
been  playing, the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand=
.?=20
The team is talking about December 3 as  a possible date he=01,ll be back b=
ut I=01,
ve heard even sooner.? Regardless, you have to figure his days  are=20
numbered.? Plus, upcoming games  against Washington and New Orleans in the=
=20
next two weeks could pose a  threat.?

QB Doug  Flutie? (Buf)? Right  or wrong, Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson=
=01,s=20
been named the starter this  week.? Hold onto him though as I=01,ve  got to=
=20
think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are  slim.



QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? So much for the Boston Globe=01,s Bill  Belichick=20
conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks.? Still though, you could=
=20
clearly see he  wasn=01,t 100% with the thumb.???

QB Brett  Favre (GB)? As you know, Favre suffered a sprained  foot against=
=20
Tampa.? While everyone  was shouting about how many weeks he=01,d miss, Fav=
re=20
told anyone who=01,d listen  today that he looked to be ready for this week=
=01,s=20
game against Indianapolis.? Players are notoriously optimistic so  keep an=
=20
eye on it.?

QB Elvis  Grbac (KC)? Don=01,t get me wrong, Grbac is still a top  QB.? He =
just=20
showed Sunday he=01,s  human.? He really should have done  more against San=
=20
Francisco though.?  On a side note, didn=01,t he say he=01,d shave that goo=
fy beard=20
when they  lost?=01(?

QB Brian  Griese (Den)? It=01,s the 3rd quarter of the  Monday Night game a=
s I=20
type this and it=01,s pretty obvious Brian Griese is at less  than 100% arm=
=20
strength.? Keep an eye  on this.? He=01,s a gutsy kid and has  played throu=
gh a=20
lot but it does seem to be affecting his  play.?

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)Another game, another  less than impressive=20
performance.?  Batch just seems to struggle to get anything done.???

QB Akili  Smith (Cin)? I=01,ve been ripping this guy for weeks and now I fe=
el =20
sorta bad for him as he=01,s been benched=01(for Scott Mitchell. That=01,s =
gotta =20
hurt.?

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Talk about blowing an opportunity.? Miller had been=
=20
moving the Bears and  looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade=
=20
McNown.? And then Mr. Achilles decided he didn=01,t  want to participate.? =
Nasty=20
injury  and too bad as he was showing promise.???

?

RBs Moving Down? =20

RB Charlie  Garner (SF)? Garner=01,s been a regular on the upgrade  list an=
d he=20
had another huge game Sunday where he posted 141 total yards with a  TD=20
against the Chiefs.? Two big days  loom on the horizon though.? I  promise=
=20
you he=01,ll be shut out in week 13=01(he has a bye.? And then he faces San=
 Diego=20
and New  Orleans in week 14 and 15.? He=01,s a  great player and one of the=
 best=20
RBs in the game but he=01,ll be facing some tough  matchups coming up.?

RB Ricky  Williams (NO)? As I reported yesterday to our email  subscribers,=
=20
Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss 6-8  weeks.? I had to=
=20
chuckle watching  Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn=
=01,t=20
play defense and  didn=01,t make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an=
d=20
about how Ricky=01,s just  one guy and they=01,ll be fine.? Yada yada  yada=
. ?That=20
sounds good Jim but you=01,re in for a rude awakening if  you really believ=
e=20
that (I don=01,t think he does)? Chad Morton will be the likely  replacemen=
t.?=20
Jerald Moore will get  a shot too.???

RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka (Car)? 1.7 yards per carry will not get it done f=
or=20
a  featured RB in this league and that=01,s exactly what Biakabutuka posted=
 =20
Sunday.? He=01,s got to get back on  track if the Panthers are to be effect=
ive=20
as a team.?

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every =20
game.? He only had 9 rushing  attempts Sunday for 38 yards.? If I  were him=
,=20
I=01,d pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some  carries=01(?

RB Emmitt  Smith (Dal)? What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday.?=
=20
Smith fumbled early on what should have  been a sure TD and never seemed to=
=20
recover.? I thought he=01,d carry the load for a  struggling Aikman.? Turne=
d out=20
the  other way around.?

RB Shaun  Alexander (Sea)? So much for the idea of coach Mike  Holmgren=20
throwing in the towel for 2000 and starting the young players like =20
Alexander.? The rookie is a fine  player and will get his time but for now,=
=20
it doesn=01,t=01, seem to be happening  anytime soon.?

RB Trung  Canidate? (StL)?  Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t=
he=20
rest of the  season.? I have no idea how the Rams  will function without=20
him.?

?

WRs Moving Down?

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison  getting mor=
e=20
and more quiet with each game?? He only had 4 catches for 34 yards  Sunday=
=20
and didn=01,t seem to be a big factor.?  He=01,s still one of the best WRs =
out=20
there but I=01,m worried about his  production.?

WR Terry  Glenn (NE)? Glenn=01,s faded down the stretch and the  Bledsoe th=
umb=20
injury won=01,t help his play one bit.? Don=01,t be too down on him as he d=
oes=20
have  some favorable matchups on the horizon.?  But if Bledsoe can=01,t go,=
 it=01,s=20
trouble for Glenn.?

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge.? The Bears ar=
e=20
now with their #3 QB and  you can only expect so much.?  Robinson will make=
=20
any QB better but there=01,s only so much he can  do.?

WR Antonio  Freeman (GB)? Freeman appears to be headed toward the  path he=
=20
was on a few weeks ago =01) mediocrity.? And that was with a healthy Favre.=
?=20
With a?less than  healthy?Favre, it could be worse.???

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Keyshawn Johnson=01,s gain is Green=01,s loss  as Q=
B Shaun=20
King seems locked in on Johnson.? Green will still catch the occasional  lo=
ng=20
ball but it appears for now, he=01,s the clear cut #2 WR.?

WR Terrence  Wilkins (Ind)? Suddenly, Terrence Wilkins is the  forgotten ma=
n=20
in the Colts passing game.?  For some reason, Peyton Manning just isn=01,t=
=20
giving him the looks.???

?

TEs Moving Down?

TE Kyle  Brady (Jac)? Brady=01,s still a solid TE but with the  return of J=
immy=20
Smith, it=01,s clear that he won=01,t be the big target he had  been.???

TE Jay  Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma was a total non factor in  Sunday=01,s g=
ame=20
catching only 1 pass for 7 yards.? One has to think the QB shuffle could =
=20
have an effect.?

TE Itula  Mili (Sea)? Mili=01,s yielded his starting TE job to  Christian F=
auria=20
and Fauria seems fairly intent on keeping it.? Mili may be a contributor bu=
t=20
it looks  like he wont=01, see enough action to make him a consistent  thre=
at.
