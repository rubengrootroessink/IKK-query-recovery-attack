WW II Codes and Ciphers

 http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/

This homespun site was created by Tony Sale, a man instrumental in
preserving, restoring, and curating the historical collection at
Bletchley Park. Headquarters of British code-breaking during World
War II, Bletchley was "Britain's best kept secret" -- the place
where the German Enigma was finally deciphered in an incredible
cooperative super-effort. Detailed tutorials for the mathematically
inclined explain how the Enigma cipher machine worked and how the
Lorenz code was broken by the British-built Colossus machine. A
Bletchley Park photo album presents snapshots of an ordinary-looking,
extraordinary place.

The Brownie Camera @ 100: A Celebration

 http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/brownieCam/brownieCam.shtml

In February of 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced the
Brownie, a compact portable camera that cost $1. During the first
year, over 150,000 cameras were sold. The Brownie was designed and
intended for children, but it's explosive popularity led to the
birth of popular photography, the rise of photojournalism, and the
all-American snapshot. Kodak's gorgeously designed site offers
dozens of recollections, original advertisements, audio commentary
clips, and plenty of Brownie-shot snaps.

--------------------

BoondocksNet.com

 http://www.boondocksnet.com/

This site was created by historian and Mark Twain scholar Jim Zwick.
It began in early 1995 as a page about Twain's writing on the U.S.
expansionist war in the Philippines; since then, it has become an
essential library of historical texts, articles, photographs, and
political cartoons for the study of imperialism and anti-imperialism
in the late 19th and early 20th century. Remarkable e-texts and
related gems include: Arthur Conan Doyle's The Crime of the Congo,
Hull House founder Jane Addams' The Long Road of Woman's Memory,
and an interpretive archive of 3D stereoscopic photographs. And
the title? Boondocks, which means rough country, is derived from
the Tagalog word for mountain, and entered American English around
the time of the Phillipine-American War.

Antimatter: Mirror of the Universe

 http://livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/index2.html

From CERN in Switzerland, the amazing particle physics laboratory
that brought us Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web, comes this
introduction to antimatter. Tune in on November 21 to a live
educational webcast produced in cooperation with San Francisco's
Exploratorium or listen anytime to the archived presentation. Take
a guided video tour of the Low Energy Anti-Proton Ring (LEAR), a
particle accelerator that lets scientists create and observe
antimatter in a quest to understand how the universe works. Read
about Paul Dirac and the history of antimatter or see how it has
seeped in to our daily lives.

--------------------

Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World

 http://www.nypl.org/utopia/

In bilingual collaboration with the BibliothSque nationale de France
(France's national library), this exhibition explores the roots of
utopian thinking from ancient traditions to modern times. Travel
from the Garden of Eden to the City of God, then on to Thomas More's
definitive 1516 work, Utopia, a word that means both "good place"
and "no place." The exquisite image collection covers the Enlightenment,
19th-century revolutionary dreams, 20th-century dystopic nightmares,
and 21st-century metaworlds. The paintings and illustrations will
make you wish you were going nowhere too... or would that be
Erewhon?

--------------------

This is SportsCenter

 http://espn.go.com/thisissportscenter/

Which is better: ESPN's SportsCenter or the commercials for the
show? If you're a fan of the latter, you'll enjoy this rotating
selection of choice ads. No dumb beer ad humor here. SportsCenter
ads are like tiny Saturday Night Live skits: self-deprecating,
offbeat, and usually very funny, even if you don't like sports. So
treat yourself to a two-minute sanity timeout.

--------------------

short stories at east of the web

 http://www.short-stories.co.uk/

British web-design firm east of the web presents this splendid
collection of short stories organized by theme: fiction, romance,
crime, sci-fi & fantasy, humor, horror, hyperfiction, children's,
and non-fiction. How perfectly civil of them. Most of the stories
are wonderful, and thanks to public interest copyright law, they're
all free. Read them onscreen, print them out for the train ride
home, or download them onto your Palm Pilot.

--------------------

Lego Star Wars Trilogy

 http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf/

The product of over 2,500 hours of monomaniacal determination, the
Lego Star Wars Trilogy recreates 180 key scenes from the original
series. Relive all of those magical moments through Lego-lensed
glasses: the Tatooine races, the Hoth battles, the Ewok dances.
You won't find any Millennium Falcon or Imperial Walker Lego sets
in stores; these are all custom-made models. As your Japanese host
S. Fujita proclaims, "I completed this project by myself without
any support." Thank you, S. Fujita.
