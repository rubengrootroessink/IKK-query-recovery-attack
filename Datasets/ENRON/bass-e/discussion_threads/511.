Once upon a midnight dreary
  While the Crew rested, victorious and weary
        There came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping
        Rapping at Kyle Field's door.
        "T'is a Heisman hopeful," Hankwitz muttered.
        Tapping at Kyle Field's door.
      -Only Josh Heupel and nothing more.

        Distinctly I remember, 1990 in December
        Another Heisman hopeful for the Crew to dismember.
        A crying Detmer mother in the stands; ESPN and many       Aggie fans
        Two dislocated shoulders and a 65-14 bore
        Still the most bowl points a team could score.
        -Twas Ty Detmer and nothing more.

        The media marvelled at a man named Bo
        #16 ranked Auburn's Heisman bro.
        In the Cotton Bowl the Crew stood tall
        4 downs later it was the Aggies' ball.
        A goal line stand for the world to adore
        A Jackie(S.) coming-out party as the Aggies roar.
        -Twas Bo Jackson and nothing more.

      Then Mr. Brown came beguiling
        With many Irish eyes a-smiling.
        His Heisman trophy aloft in the air,
        As was his towel after an Aggie dare.
        A 35-10 victory on the Cotton Bowl floor
        And Wrecking Crew dominance for many years more.
        -Twas Tim Brown and nothing more.

        Then came Houston's QB Ware
        Running and shooting thru humid air.
        He won the Heisman while at Cougar High,
        But the Crew took off his helmet and made him cry.
        Another conference championship in Aggie lore
        And another Heisman winner shown the door.
        -Twas Andre Ware and nothing more.

        To Kyle Field comes a Sooner Nation
        With a Big 12 South ring and national championship
expectation.
        Last year's loss the Wrecking Crew must avenge
        And the Aggie offense must prepare for revenge.
        Will Heupel audible without chore?
        Will #1 OU have a Heisman in store?
        -Quoth the 12th Man.... "Nevermore."
