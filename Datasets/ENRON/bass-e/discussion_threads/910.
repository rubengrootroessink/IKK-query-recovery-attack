Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? "In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 
coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
"if he plays he plays" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?
?
Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: "James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.
?
Joe
