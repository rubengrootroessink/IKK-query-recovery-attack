                      Election Day, Tuesday, November 7, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  I want to remind you that today is election day.  Our
  generation has a chance to make a difference - to send a
  signal that we want new leaders who trust you, not
  government.  You deserve a government for the 21st century
  -- a government that reflects your values -- your
  entrepreneurial spirit, your trust in initiative, and your
  commitment to leaving behind a better world than you
  inherited.

  Our Republican team would provide that kind of leadership.
  George W. Bush and all of our great Republican candidates
  will focus on results, not daily polls.

  The other side has been running non-stop negative attacks
  against our candidates.  Don't let their fear tactics
  succeed.  Please take your family and friends to the
  polls today and vote for George W. Bush and all of our
  great Republican team.

  Thank you very much.

  George P. Bush
