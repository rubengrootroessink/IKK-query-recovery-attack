Hi Folks,

First off, congratulations  on a great season.I assume if you=01,re  still =
in=20
the hunt this late in the year, you have to call 2000 a successful =20
campaign.? Enjoy it.? It=01,s an intense time and you can=01,t slack  off n=
ow but=20
it=01,s also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens  in t=
he=20
next few weeks.? It=01,s tough  enough just to get to this point.?  Great w=
ork!

From my perspective it=01,s  interesting in that the actual number of folks=
 who=20
read the material drops way  off this time of year.? But the  other side of=
=20
the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading  shoots throu=
gh=20
the roof.? There may  not be as many folks reading as there were in=20
September, but the ones that are  here are into in a big way!???

I=01,ll do my dead level best  to keep up my end of the bargain and provide=
 the=20
best info I can all the way to  the week 17 games.? Lets get at  it.?

Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.? =20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online (will be available?late Wednesday evening=
=20
at?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm?  ) ?for exactly where I rank=
=20
players and to determine who to start.? Just because one matchup may be mor=
e =20
favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player=
=20
with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is meant to be just one more too=
l=20
in your box when it comes to deciding between  players.??=20

Note:? I=01,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last f=
our=20
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mik=

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

New Orleans Passing Game  vs Bronco Defense???? I stuck my neck out a  bit=
=20
last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me.? This week, he=20
draws a great matchup with  a Denver defense that=01,s not been able to sto=
p=20
anyone through the air.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 31  in passi=
ng=20
yards allowed per game.?  Denver has averaged giving up 308 yards passing p=
er=20
game over that  span.? With CB Ray Crockett out with  a torn hamstring, Jim=
my=20
Spencer will fill in for him again this week.? He and Terrell Buckley can=
=20
definitely be  beaten. Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn, his primary weapon=
=20
but  Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option.? RB Chad=20
Morton catches the ball  pretty well out of the backfield.?  TE Aaron Glove=
r=20
still is total non factor for Fantasy  purposes.? I'm doing my best to not=
=20
get  carried away with Brooks.? Keep telling yourself the young man has=20
exactly  2 games of NFL experience.? On the other hand, there comes a time=
=20
when you  take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes.? This gu=
y=20
isn't  playing like a 2 game rookie and the Denver defense is awful.? =20

St. Louis Passing Game vs  Carolina Defense?? I want to believe.? I believe=
=20
in Kurt  Warner and I believe he=01,ll get his Rams back on track.? As much=
 as=20
anything, I believe you=01,ll  see Marshall Faulk at least see more action =
than=20
he saw last  week.? Warner=01,s an MVP but I think  it=01,s Faulk that make=
s this=20
team go.?  He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commi=
t =20
safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game.? If the=20
defense plays the pass, then  Faulk can kill them with the run or short=20
passes.? After last week, I=01,d be shocked if coach  Mike Martz doesn=01,t=
 get=20
back to utilizing?his?star RB?more.? Kurt Warner makes his return and I=01,=
m =20
guessing he picks up where he left off.?  That=01,s not what you=01,d expec=
t to=20
happen but Warner=01,s made a career of  exceeding expectations.? If he=01,=
s on =20
your roster, I think you have to go with him.? Especially against this=20
defense.? Carolina ranks # 30 in passing yards  allowed per game over the=
=20
last four weeks.?  For WRs, it=01,s always tough to pick.?  Isaac Bruce and=
=20
Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly, Ricky Proehl=01,s  been on fire=
=20
lately.? Az-Zahir Hakim  is always worth a shot too.? Any one  of these guy=
s=20
can go off.? TE Roland  Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he=
=01,s=20
a decent producer  too.

Atlanta Passing Game vs  Seattle Defense?? This one is a pure matchup play=
=20
as  Dan Reeves makes the move for starting?QB Doug Johnson over the  fading=
=20
Chris Chandler.? I=01,m not a  big fan of either but if you find yourself f=
aced=20
with the prospect of starting a  Falcon QB, this is the week to do it if yo=

re ever going to.? The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk  and more like =
an=20
albatross around Mike Holmgren=01,s neck.? They=01,re awful.? Over the last=
 four=20
weeks, they rank # 29  in passing yards allowed per game.?  Good luck picki=
ng=20
the WR as Terrance Mathis has been  invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson =
is=20
making a  resurgence.? A few weeks ago, it was  Mathis who was hot while=20
Jefferson faded.?  If you made me pick one, I=01,d reluctantly go with=20
Jefferson.? TE Reggie Kelly did  catch 3 passes Sunday but I=01,m not count=
ing=20
on him for too  much.

Pittsburgh Passing Game  vs Raider Defense?? Kor-DELL=01(Kor-DELL=01(Kor-DE=
LL???=20
What brought this guy back  to life?? I dunno but you can bet  coach Bill=
=20
Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling.? Kordell Stewar=
t=20
looks to be  playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much o=
f=20
the game at this  level is mental.? No one ever  doubted his physical=20
skills.? The  obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico =
=20
Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward.? I think it=01,s ironic that W=
ard=20
was very  much a Kordell-like =01&Slash=018 player in college at Georgia.? =
Bobby=20
Shaw is getting into the  act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of=
=20
wonders, TE Mark  Bruener caught a TD Sunday.? You  know things are changin=
g=20
when Bruener gets in the endzone.? The Raiders are an extremely good =20
football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles  heel.

Cincinnati Passing Game  vs Cardinal Defense?? Another interesting aspect o=
f =20
writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which =
=20
players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December ar=
e =20
stocked with the obvious stars.?  QB Scott Mitchell likely doesn=01,t fall =
into=20
that =01&star=018  category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decis=
ion to=20
start him this  week but if he=01,s your best QB, this might be your lucky=
=20
week.? First of all, let=01,s assume he gets the  knee ready to go.? This e=
arly=20
in the  week, that=01,s honestly a shaky assumption.?  We=01,ll know more l=
ater.?=20
But  if he can go, he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal=20
defense.? WR Peter Warrick could be a  decent play too although Aeneas=20
Williams is a solid cover guy.? He=01,s hard to count out though just  beca=
use=20
of his home run ability.?  Funny how I don=01,t see many people complaining=
=20
about his 40 times  now=01(? RB Corey Dillon is the  only other starter on =
this=20
team but we=01,ll catch up with him in the rushing  Matchups.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Arizona Passing Game vs  Bengal Defense?? Let=01,s be clear, I=01,m no Jake=
 =20
Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is he=01,s got a pretty decent matc=
hup =20
this week.? He=01,s reportedly making  good progress and should start Sunda=
y.? =20
Partly because, he=01,s better, partly because Dave Brown was just  awful.?=
=20
=01&Worse than Plummer=018 has a  nasty ring to it=01(? But this Bengal  pa=
ss defense=20
is pretty bad.? Over  the past four weeks, they rank # 26 in passing yards=
=20
allowed  per game.? WRs David Boston has the physical  tools to do some=20
damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an  impact.? Remember,=
=20
this is the unit  that made Pittsburgh look like the 1999 Rams last week.??=
?

New York Jets Passing  Game vs Colts Defense?? The Jets have been up and do=
wn=20
a  bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling=20
Indianapolis  defense.? The pathetic Colt pass  rush only has 4 sacks in th=
e=20
last 4 games.?  QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup=
=20
with  271 yards and 1 TD.? WR Wayne  Chrebet=01,s been in a funk lately but=
 in=20
their week he went off catching 8  passes for 140.? Sure some of it was =20
late, but garbage stats count too.?  Dedric Ward caught just 54 yards worth=
=20
of passes but he scored in  that game.? He=01,s come on lately  after fadin=
g=20
early. Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it  appears. RB=20
Curtis Martin still is struggling to get 100% healthy  and that will hurt a=
=20
little.? TE  Anthony Becht is a bright spot as he=01,s beginning to contrib=
ute.?=20
December in New York will make a  difference to this soft Colt team which=
=20
doesn=01,t play as well in the  cold.?

Detroit Passing Game vs  Viking Defense?? Charlie Batch continued to  look=
=20
good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his (well deserved) =20
candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving.? His ribs are=20
reportedly better and he  had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball.??=
=20
The Viking secondary could have  matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton a=
nd=20
Herman Moore.? Over the last four weeks, Minnesota  ranks # 24 in passing=
=20
yards allowed  per game.? For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy  Points=
=20
allowed to opposing QBs.? The  Vikings are tough on TEs ranking # 7 in=20
Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the  year but TE David Sloan has played=
=20
very well of late.? He ranks # 6 in Fantasy Points among TEs  over the last=
 3=20
games and is well worth a start here.

Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  For all the hype generated by New=
=20
Orleans=01, defense, they give up tons of  yards passing.? Over the last fo=
ur =20
weeks, they rank # 23 in passing yards allowed  per game.? They do sack the=
=20
QB a ton (19 over the  last four weeks) but they still give up the yards. I=
t=01,
s kind of unusual to see  that. They=01,ll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Den=
ver=20
team that=01,s trying to  find their way.? Frerotte=01,s been up  and down =
after=20
his monster week 12 game.?  The Saints continue to drop like flies and the=
=20
loss of CB Fred Weary will  definitely hurt.? Both WRs Rod  Smith and Ed=20
McCaffrey are solid plays as always.? And as crazy as it sounds, either one=
=20
of  the 2 headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond? Clark are decen=
t=20
options too.? Byron Chamberlain  normally makes it a 3 headed TE monster bu=
t=20
he=01,s nursing a bad Achilles tendon  and didn=01,t play last week.? As no=
ted =20
above, Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a hig=

scoring affair.? I doubt you could  have predicted a shootout between Aaron=
=20
Brooks and Gus Frerotte 4 months ago but  that=01,s why they play the games=
=01(

Even  Matchups:? These games feature no  real advantage either way?

Chicago Passing Game vs Packer  Defense??  I=01,m torn  here.? You probably=
 saw=20
how weak the  Packer defense looked Monday night.?  They couldn=01,t do muc=
h of=20
anything.?  But on the other hand, the Bears will likely go with Shane=20

h=20
Matthews at the helm.? Still  though, there=01,s some hope.? On a  brighter=

spot, Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie  Kennison who had 6=

to start this week but I think it's still a week  early.

New  England Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? Kansas City and New England ar=
e =20
two once proud teams that are struggling.?  This week a banged up Drew =20
