Getting lots of questions on Martin.  Nothing definitive yet, but here's the
latest I have from the New York Daily News by By Rich Cimini:
http://www.nydailynews.com/2000-11-22/Metro_Sports/Football/a-89509.asp
From the article:  "The Jets provided no update yesterday on Curtis Martin,
but his injury isn't believed to be serious. His status for Sunday's game
against the Bears remains in doubt. It appears that Martin was drilled in
the tailbone by a Dolphins defender. It swelled up on the team flight back
from Miami, and ice was applied. Al Groh has declined to provide specifics,
except to say the injury occurred in the "general pelvic region."
The Jets' star running back, who underwent intensive treatment yesterday,
has told several people that he's fine. He's known for his high pain
threshold, and it wouldn't shock teammates if he played this week.

My View:  Players are notorious for being optimistic but Martin is a tough
guy.  Another reason why these Thursday games are so tough.  If you wanted
waffling, you wouldn't be signed up for this newsletter so I'm going to say
as of Wednesday morning, I think the chances he plays effectively as
normally would are 75%.
Thanks to my friend Nicholas Bollini for assistance on this one.
Good Luck this weekend.

Joe
