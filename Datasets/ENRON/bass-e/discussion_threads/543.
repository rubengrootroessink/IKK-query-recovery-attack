Defensive Opportunities??  Duane Cahill from the Pittsburgh Tribune Review 
checks in with his  weekly look at defensive situations across the league 
that could create  opportunities for the offensive players across the line 
from them.
?
Once again this week, Zach Thomas finds himself on  the inactive list. 
Without him, the Miami D gave up 95 yards to Ahman Green last  Sunday.? James 
Stewart scored three times a couple of weeks back against  the Bucs tough D 
(without MLB Jamie Duncan), so there's no reason not to start  him, 
regardless of the matchup.

In the same game, keep an eye on Stephen  Boyd's status with the Lions.? He's 
missed most of the week's practices  with a bruised foot that was sore enough 
there was concern it was  fractured.? If he can't go, that opens things up 
for the 'Fins Lamar  Smith.

Keith Brooking joined Jessie Tuggle on the IR this week, meaning  that Mike 
Alstott will have huge holes up the middle of the Falcons' defense to  rumble 
through.? Look for big games from both him and Warrick  Dunn.

Bryce Paup and Orlando Thomas remain out of the Vikings lineup,  which bumps 
Brett Favre's stock up a few notches.? Shaun King had a field  day last week.

For the second straight week, Jerome Bettis is facing a  defensive line 
without key components.? Henry Ford is out, and Kenny Holmes  is nursing a 
very sore shoulder.? Holmes will have to tough it out since  backup Byron 
Frisch is inactive.? The bus should keep rollin'  on.

THE GLOVES ARE OFF:  JOHNSON ACCUSES FLUTIE OF INSTIGATING...

As reported by Mark Gaughan of the  Buffalo News, Rob Johnson may be  on the 
sidelines, but he's no longer silent about the Buffalo Bills'  brewing 
quarterback controversy. Johnson took exception to a column  in this week's 
Sports Illustrated that quoted two  unidentified Bills speaking about the 
team's quarterbacks. 

The story quoted one Bill as saying, "Rob  seems distracted by things, like 
wanting everyone to like him." It  quoted another as saying, "He'd rather get 
pummeled by four guys  than throw the ball away" in order to help his 
quarterback rating.  

Johnson, who did not make himself  available to local media this week, went 
on the Jim  Rome nationally syndicated radio show Friday and said he  thinks 
it was one player who made the comments. And he thinks that  one player was 
Doug Flutie. 

"I think everyone who reads the article  will pretty much know who it is," 
Johnson said. "I think it's the  same one that's pictured in the article." 

The only Bill pictured in the article is  Flutie. 

Johnson said he confronted the player  whom he suspected on Friday. 

"We talked about it today," Johnson said.  "He said he talked about the 
quarterback rating stuff, but he never  mentioned my name. Basically, that 
was it." 

Asked if he thought Flutie was a good  teammate, Johnson said: 

"I'm sure he's a good teammate for the  rest of the guys, and he's fine with 
them. Obviously, he's real  competitive. He's reaching the end of his career. 
He probably wants  to still play. I don't blame him for that. But if he was 
responsible  for these comments, I would not consider him a good teammate."  

Johnson said he did not see the team  being divided over the QB question. 

"I don't see it that way," he said. "I  don't know though. I mean, I haven't 
talked to all the players. But  I don't think many players in our locker room 
worry about  quarterback rating or even worry about what our quarterback 
ratings  are. It's absurd to think players worry about that or even  
quarterbacks worry about that when they are playing in a football  game." 

However, he said he didn't like  unattributed comments from teammates. 

"For someone to go anonymously and say  those things is kind of, I don't 
know, cowardly," he said. "It's not  typical of football players... If a lot 
of guys feel that way, they  should come to me and say it to my face," he 
said. "I'm a man.  They're men, and I can take it. I'd rather hear about it 
from them  than hear about it on the radio when I'm driving home, from an FM  
channel when I'm trying to listen to Limp Biskit." 

Regarding the desire to be liked by his  teammates, Johnson said: 

"I'm 27 years old. Most of guys on our  team are pretty young and we have a 
lot in common. We hang out. I  don't go out of my way to make friends or kiss 
anyone's butt.  Everywhere I've been on teams, I've had a good relationship 
with the  guys on the team and I have a lot in common with them." 

Asked if he got the sense he was  competing against Joe Montana for the QB 
job,  Johnson replied, "I wish it was Joe Montana, because at least he won  
some Super Bowls and won MVPs in the league. I wish that was the  case. I 
think that would be an easier situation." 

Regarding his injured shoulder, Johnson  said it is not 100 percent. 

"It tightened up on me pretty good  today," he said. "I haven't been able to 
get my arm pretty much all  the way over the top or raise it all the way 
above my head to throw  the ball. I've kind of been side-arming things just 
trying to get  through practice so I could be the backup. I don't know what 
they  are going to do. I want to back up, but that might not be in the  best 
interest in the team (this week)." 

Head coach Wade Phillips  said Friday he would wait until pregame warm-ups 
Sunday to decide  whether Johnson would be number-two or number-three against 
New  England. 

Although Phillips wasn't willing to  address the escalating tension between 
Johnson and Flutie, Buffalo  general manager John Butler, speaking on the  
Empire Sports Network, said he doesn't fear the  team is in turmoil. 

"I was at practice today and it looked  like a football team preparing for 
the New England Patriots," he  said. "I'll tell you, if you've been around 
sports, been in locker  rooms, if you get 53 men together, not everybody is 
going to like  everybody all the time. The key is to be respectful of one 
another  and when it comes time to play, you play hard and play together.  

"Everybody isn't going to be walking hand  in hand down the hallways, but 
we've got a team that's going to  stick together and play their hearts out 
and that's all that  matters. 

"These are grown men. Sometimes it's fun  to even blow it up a little bit 
more than it is, and so be it. It's  incumbent upon our team to stick 
together and they will," he said.  "I've been through this 150 times." 

Butler dismissed the SI quotes because  they had no attribution. 

"If you want to say something and can't  put your name to it, it bothers me," 
he said. "You've got a problem  somewhere so I don't put any substance to 
it." 

Stay tuned boys and girls... We haven't  heard the last of this one...

REDMOND INJURES FOOT;  PATS LIKELY TO RELY ON FAULK...

According to Frank Dell'Apa of the  Boston Globe, it looks like Kevin  Faulk 
will be asked to carry running game when the New  England Patriots take on 
the Buffalo Bills tomorrow. 

Faulk's opportunity comes at the expense  of rookie J.R. Redmond, who 
displaced Faulk in the  starting lineup with a 22-carry, 97-yard performance 
against the  Colts two weeks ago, but was downgraded to questionable on 
Friday's  injury report after hurting his foot in practice Thursday. 

According to head coach Bill  Belichick, Redmond "stepped on something at 
practice and  wasn't able to do much (Friday)." 

"I don't know if I'll be playing more,"  Faulk said. "Whatever the game plan 
is, I'm ready every week."  

Faulk will be facing a difficult test  this time. Buffalo has surrendered 585 
rushing yards, the  second-lowest total in the NFL. 

"All you have to do is check the stats,"  Faulk said. "Teams don't average 
more than 3 yards a carry against  them." 

The Patriots are averaging 3.4 yards per  rush and Faulk is averaging 3.7 
yards per rush. 

"It's always a challenge, but this time  it's even more of a challenge 
because we are going against one of  the best defenses in the league," Faulk 
said. "We can't expect to  run over them, no. What we need is a balanced 
attack. If we can get  that going and move the football, we should be all 
right." 

Faulk was on pace to gain more than 1,000  yards after four games but he has 
tailed off with a total of 171  yards in the last four games. 

But Faulk is the team's leading  all-purpose yardage player with 1,156 yards, 
an average of 7 yards  each time he has the ball. 

Team officials had hoped the Redmond's  ascension to the first team would 
allow Faulk to concentrate on what  most observers feel he is best suited 
for: third-down duty. 

As productive as he might have been the  first half of the season, concerns 
over Faulk's durability have been  an issue from day one and Belichick is 
convinced the former LSU  standout's ability to run the ball effectively is 
inversely  proportional to the number of time he carries it... 

Other items of interest... 

After working extensively at wide  receiver this week, tight end Eric 
Bjornson was  included on the team's list of early inactives yesterday. And 
his  chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks don't sound  very 
good after team officials indicated that Rod Rutledge will  start at tight 
end for the remainder of the season... 

Wide receiver Terry  Glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice, but  
he's listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as  usual 
against the Bills tomorrow. 

Quarterback Drew Bledsoe  missed Thursday's practice in order to stay with 
his wife as she  gave birth to the couple's third child. The veteran signal 
caller  will start and play as usual tomorrow.

REDSKINS' JOHNSON HAS  SIGNIFICANT MCL TEAR...

Mark Maske of the Washington  Post reported this morning that Redskins 
quarterback  Brad Johnson is suffering from a significant tear  to the medial 
collateral ligament in his left knee that is  relatively close to being a 
complete tear. 

Maske went on to write, "even when his  MCL heals sufficiently for him to 
resume playing, Johnson will face  the risk of suffering a more severe knee 
injury by playing on the  damaged joint. He will have to decide how much risk 
to take playing  for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason, 
at a  time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed  
income beyond this season. 

"As he exited Redskins Park yesterday,  Johnson acknowledged the increased 
risks but said he plans to play  again this season and will make his 
decisions based solely upon his  physical readiness to play, not upon future 
financial  considerations. He said the timetable for his return is unclear, 
but  he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the St. Louis  
game." 

Team officials expect Johnson to miss  that November 20 meeting with the 
Rams. Of course, the former Viking  has already been ruled out for tomorrow's 
game against Arizona and  Jeff George will make his first appearance with  
Washington's first team offense this season. 

Maske cited a source close to the  situation as saying, coaches hope Johnson 
will return in time for  the team's November 26 meeting with Philadelphia at 
FedEx Field.  

Johnson told Maske yesterday that he has  every intention of playing again 
this season. 

"There's no doubt about that (he will  play again this season). I think it's 
a matter of when. The weeks  kind of go by fast. But we're still dealing with 
seven more games, a  bye week and the playoffs. Right now our team just has 
to find a way  to win, and I've got to find a way to get healthy. In time, 
then  we'll get back together." 

Johnson said he would like to be ready to  play against the Rams, the 
defending Super Bowl champions. The  Redskins have 15 days between games 
because they have a bye the  weekend after Sunday's Arizona game. 

"We probably won't make a decision about  the St. Louis game until the 
Wednesday or Thursday before the game,"  Johnson said. "I would like to play. 
I think that would be a great  game to be part of. The biggest decision isn't 
whether it's  (artificial) turf or grass. It's just being able to drop back 
and  being healthy enough to play a full game." 

However, Maske's sources indicate the  Redskins are already planning for 
George to start against St. Louis  a week from this coming Monday. 

Team officials have described Johnson's  injury as a Grade 2 MCL sprain, but 
Maske's sources say the injury  is at the severe end of the Grade 2 range and 
actually borders on  being a Grade 3 sprain. 

A Grade 2 injury is defined as one in  which the tissue has been partially 
but not completely torn and  there is appreciable limitation in function. A 
Grade 3 injury is one  in which tissue has been significantly or completely 
torn or  disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function.  

NFL players regularly play with MCL  injuries. The risk players take by 
playing on damaged knees is that  they will suffer more severe knee injuries. 
Johnson said he knows  the risks but will play when he is able. 

"The biggest thing is, right now the  ligament is weak," he said. "Obviously 
right now... It could worsen  very easily if I took a hit. There hasn't been 
a whole lot of  discussion about that. The biggest discussion now is how 
we're going  to treat it and get back as soon as possible. When I'm healthy  
enough to drop back and play, then I'll play that day." 

Johnson says the fact he intends to test  the free agent market after the 
season won't be a factor in  determining when he plays again. 

"The most important thing for me is to be  able to drop back in the pocket," 
Johnson said. "From that point on,  if I can drop back in the pocket, then 
I'll play. I'm not worried  about ever taking a hit. I've gone through 
injuries before. The  biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play. 
I'm not worried  about a contract next year with anyone. I feel like my play 
overall,  and my history, will take care of itself." 

Johnson was on the practice field  yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped. 
He moved little, made some  throws and mostly watched George and rookie 
quarterback Todd  Husak -- who has been elevated from third to second on the  
Redskins' depth chart -- at work. 

"I feel much better than I did Tuesday or  Wednesday," Johnson said. "I can 
throw normal. There's no problem  there. I can do a lot of walking. I ride 
the (exercise) bike about  an hour a day. The problem is going lateral, side 
to side. As a  quarterback, that's what you do in the pocket. So I'm not able 
to  drop back at full speed and throw. But I'm better than I was earlier  in 
the week." 

Other notes of interest out of Washington  this morning... 

Veteran fullback Larry  Centers comes off a productive game last Monday 
night,  catching six passes for 39 yards and a touchdown. Given the  
Redskins' injury problems at wide out, Centers could get a number of  looks 
out of the backfield this week against his old team, the  Cardinals. 

Although Albert Connell,  Irving Fryar and James Thrash are  all expected to 
play, the chances of any of them going full speed  are slim. 

Look for cornerback Champ  Bailey will see his most extensive playing time of 
the  season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat  to 
keep the Cards from focusing their all of their attention RB  Stephen Davis. 

Davis had 280 yards on 55 attempts in his  two games against the Cardinals in 
1999 and in what will be a  scaled-back game plan, he's likely to get 25-30 
carries against the  Cardinals' marshmallow-soft defensive front seven.

BRONCOS KNOW DAVIS IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR  SUCCESS...

This is it... It's time for Denver Broncos running back  Terrell Davis to 
make his second comeback of the  season against the Jets tomorrow. Unlike the 
season opener when all  eyes were on the veteran's surgically reconstructed 
right knee, this  time everybody will be watching Davis' badly sprained left 
foot and  ankle that get all the attention. 

The former University of Georgia star has  missed five of the last seven 
games -- including three in a row --  and has gained only 99 total yards on 
24 carries... 

Don't look for coaches to push Davis  incredibly hard in his first game back. 
In fact, Davis isn't sure  how much he might be capable of doing this week. 

"Let me just finish this game. If I can  finish this game I'll be the 
happiest man on this planet," Davis  said. "If I can stay healthy, I know 
good things are going to  happen..." 

And make no mistake about it: Keeping  Davis healthy becomes job number-one 
from here on out. Coaches are  certainly aware than whatever chances the team 
might have of making  a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive 
Davis in the  mix. 

So the goal this week will be easing him  back into playing shape by giving 
him maybe 15 carries tomorrow with  Mike Anderson taking the rest... 

One factor working in Davis' favor  Howard Griffith's return to the lineup 
after  experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last  
two weeks. The veteran fullback said it's all part of the process,  however, 
and has practiced full speed all week. 

"It's getting there. It's not going to be  100 percent until I'm not banging 
people anymore," he said...  

Bottom line on Davis? 

My expectations are high for him over the  remainder of the season, but I'm 
not sure I'd want to bank on a huge  game in his first week back... 

One last note out of Denver this  morning... Backup running back KaRon 
Coleman was  included on Friday's list of early inactives due to a sprained  
foot.

A RELIEVED JEFF GEORGE  READY TO FACE CARDINALS...

According to the Associated Press,  veteran quarterback Jeff George looked 
relieved and  relaxed after practice Friday. It was easier to concentrate on 
his  upcoming first start with the Washington Redskins knowing that his  
newborn baby was doing fine. 

"Thank God," George said. "I think  whenever something goes wrong and it's 
your own, you worry. First  things first. My family's number-one in my life, 
and I got to take  care of them." 

George is starting Sunday's game at  Arizona because Brad Johnson sprained a 
knee  ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. But instead of  preparing 
full-tilt for his first action of the season, George  missed practice 
Wednesday when his wife delivered their third child.  

The next day, George was distracted by  news that the baby, Jayden Scott, had 
breathing  difficulties. It was only just before Thursday afternoon's 
practice  that he received word that the baby was fine. 

George, who earlier this season answered  "dad" when asked to give one word 
to describe himself, was confident  he could overcome the distractions and 
give a good performance  Sunday. 

"When you get some sort of news like we  did," George said, "you take a back 
seat and say, `What's more  important?' But I've prepared myself. It hasn't 
been just this week,  I've been preparing the last 10 weeks. It's not a cram 
session. I've  been preparing from the get-go." 

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million  contract in April to back up 
Johnson so he could have a shot at  playing for a Super Bowl team. He said he 
doesn't see Sunday's game  as an audition either to replace Johnson or to 
build interest in  other teams considering an off-season trade. 

"I think everybody knows what I can do,"  George said. "We've got an injury, 
and I've got to carry the torch.  You hate to have to play under these 
circumstances. Brad's my  friend. I wish him well. I hope he recovers fast." 

Johnson, who could miss two to four weeks  with the injury, is one of many 
ailing Redskins starters, including  wide receivers Irving Fryar and Albert  
Connell, who are likely to be less than full speed for  Sunday's game. 

"I probably feel the healthiest out of  anybody," George said. 

Coaches might have Skip  Hicks handle kickoff returns against the Cardinals 
this  Sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for James  Thrash, who has 
been returning kickoffs and punts, starting  at wide receiver -- and -- 
playing on kickoff and punt coverage  teams...
