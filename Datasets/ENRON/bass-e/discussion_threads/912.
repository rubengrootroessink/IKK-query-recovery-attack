 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Voskuhl was placed on the injured list by Chicago with a right hip flexor 
strain today. One of the Bulls second-round picks in the June draft, Voskuhl 
was averaging 1.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in four games this season.  

 Dalibor Bagaric , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Bulls today activated Bagaric, the 24th pick overall in the June draft. 
He had missed Chicago's first 10 games with a bruised right knee. Bagaric 
averaged 18.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Benston Zagreb of the Croatian 
League last year.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors waived Livingston today, less than one week after signing him 
as a free agent. He had appeared in only two games and was expendable with 
the return of Bob Sura from injury.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors activated Sura from the injured list today. He had been 
sidelined all season with a lower back injury suffered during training camp. 
The 27-year-old was acquired in June from Cleveland via Milwaukee in a 
three-team deal, after he had posted a career-high 13.8 point-per-game 
average with the Cavaliers.  

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers activated Sundov from the injured list after placing Tyus Edney 
on the same list today. The 20-year-old center had been sidelined all season 
with a sprained left ankle.  

 Tyus Edney , G IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers placed Edney on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis in 
his left foot. The 5-10, 152-pound center will miss a minimum of five games. 
He was averaging 3.4 points and 1.9 assists in eight games this season.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Thorpe received a cortisone shot in his ailing left foot, and he will be 
sidelined another four weeks. He was placed on the injured list on Thursday 
after averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in six games.  

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Camby had an MRI during Sunday's game which confirmed that he only has a 
sprained ankle.  He turned the ankle in Friday night's win over Phoenix.  He 
is listed as day to day, and it is unclear whether he will begin playing 
tonight or tomorrow. Camby has been the best center in the Eastern Confernece 
thus far, so make sure to start him as soon as he returns to the lineup.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Brandon, who has missed four games with an ankle sprain, practiced for the 
first time on Monday since being hurt on Nov. 9.  He said he might return to 
the lineup when the Timberwolves host the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday 
night.     

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 After initially expecting a return to the court tonight against Cleveland, 
it seems that Jones will miss at least tonight's game - and likely more. "The 
doctor told me flat out," Jones said, "it's going to be awhile."  Jones tried 
to participate in drills yesterday, but his injured calf continued to tighten 
on him.  If Jones is on your roster, it's a good idea to keep him on the 
bench until his prognosis is a bit more clear.    

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Nowitzki re-aggravated a left shoulder injury in the third quarter of Monday 
night's game against the Jazz.  He left the game and did not return, but did 
post 20 points and 14 rebounds before exiting.  He is not expected to miss 
any time because of the injury.  Nowitzki is establishing himself as a real 
Fantasy star, so continue to start him as long as his shoulder holds up.    

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  "It's very 
painful at times," said Thomas. "The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible."  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.
