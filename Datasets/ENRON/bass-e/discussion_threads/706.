On Election Night, George W. Bush won the most votes in Florida.
Not surprisingly, Al Gore's campaign did not like the result.  They
immediately dispatched lawyers to Florida and had a Washington
lobbyist raise $3 million in one day to fund Gore's Florida operation.

Unfortunately, the Gore camp refuses to accept the Election Night
count or the 2nd computer count or even, in some instances, a 3rd
computer count.  Now they want a hand count, even though computer
counts are more precise and objective.  On top of that, they have only
asked for hand counts in counties that are overwhelmingly Democratic.

We have the high ground.  We're poised to win.  But we need your help
to defend the integrity of the Florida election.

disclose, the Bush Cheney Recount Fund will limit contributions to
$5,000 and disclose its donors on our Website.

Thank you for all you've done to help elect Governor Bush and
Secretary Cheney.  Your continued commitment and generosity during
this important time in the life of our country is greatly appreciated.
