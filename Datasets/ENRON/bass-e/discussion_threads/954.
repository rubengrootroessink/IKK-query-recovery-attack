**************************** November 28, 2000  ************************

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to
dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York
City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities
and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock
in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be
heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem
off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break, Easter,
Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out the
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10089324.

ELITE STATUS ON TWA AFTER ONLY ONE TRIP
If you've been considering discretionary leisure travel in December, this
deal could give you the inspiration to confirm. If you have to travel in
December, this deal gives you a bonus that lasts long after you land. Fly
just one roundtrip by December 31, 2000 and we will jump your TWA Aviators
frequent flyer status to elite level--a level that usually requires 25,000
airmiles in one year. If you like free, space-available upgrades to First
Class and bonus miles on all your future trips, you're going to like this
benefit. we'll even show you how to do it on reduced fares. For full
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10108936.
