Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Al  
Gore
