 Latest NFL Player News 

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Hatchette left Sunday's game in the second half after pulling a muscle on 
his side.  Troy Walters replaced Hatchette as the third wideout.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game in the first half with a concussion. He was 
replaced by Anthony Wright. Randall Cunningham is the team's emergency QB 
this week because of his recent groin problems.  

 Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wright replaced an injured Troy Aikman early in the second quarter of 
Sunday's game against Washington.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Fiedler suffered an injured left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 
Buccaneers.  The injury seemed to affect his accuracy as he threw four 
interceptions in the game.  Keep an eye on his situation.  The injury may 
warrant you dropping him from your Fantasy lineup next week.       

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 McNair was lifted in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. 
Jeff Fisher replaced him with Neil O'Donnell, deciding McNair needed a 
well-deserved rest to keep him healthy after throwing three TD passes.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 Taylor left Sunday's game against Jacksonville in the third quarter with the 
Jaguars leading 30-3. He seemed to suffer a minor injury to his knee that had 
been bothering him earlier in the year, but he remained on the sidelines and 
appeared to be in good condition.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Greisen replaced an ineffective Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game at Jacksonville.
