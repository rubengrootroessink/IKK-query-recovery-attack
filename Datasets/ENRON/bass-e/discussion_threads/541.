 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  
 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Murder Inc. Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.
