 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 German was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is 
listed as probable for Sunday's game.  He was used as the third receiver 
earlier this season when Tim Dwight was sidelined with various injuries but 
has done little to push for extra playing time.  German has just one catch 
all season.     

 Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the 
Colts and the trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and Marvin Harrison.  
Their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling 25 sacks and 
allowing 216.3 yards per game.  They will need to apply a little more 
pressure on Indianapolis to contain Manning and Harrison.  Look for Green Bay 
to come at Manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough 
for them to have success against the Colts and their balanced attack.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia, and likely won't 
travel with the team on their trip to Philadelphia for this week's game 
against the Eagles. Jones has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners 
thus far, accounting for only 410 yards of total offense and two touchdowns 
this season.  

 David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/17/00 
 Sloan practiced Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game.  He is 
recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last week's game.  
Sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score  
a touchdown this season.    

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/17/00 
 With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the 
start this week against the Chiefs.  If Morris has been one of your main 
tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/17/00 
 Morris remains questionable for Sunday's game against the Chiefs with an 
ankle injury.  Head Coach Wade Phillips believes that Morris will be a 
game-time decision, so keep the Bills' rookie tailback on the bench this week 
if at all possible.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/17/00 
 Favre practiced Thursday and is expected to start Sunday's game at 
Indianapolis.  "The ball came out sharp," said offensive coordinator Tom 
Rossley.  "He was right on the money. I was pleased with what he did today."  
If Favre can stay in the game this Sunday he could have a big day.  The Colts 
have one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL, having allowed 15 TD passes 
this season.    

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/16/00 
 Sanders had his best game in five weeks last Sunday, catching five passes 
for 82 yards in Arizona's 31-14 loss to the Vikings. He is currently battling 
a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with 
the Eagles.  It would be a wise move to bench Sanders this week, especially 
against an aggressive Philadelphia secondary.   

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last Sunday against the 
Vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass.  In fact, "The Snake" has 
thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. Things won't get 
better for Plummer this week against the Eagles, who will blitz him 
relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions.    

 Troy Brown , WR NE - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Brown caught only two passes for ten yards last Sunday against the Browns.  
Although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, Brown is far too 
inconsistent to be considered a starter by most Fantasy league standards.  

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating 
back to Week Four against the Dolphins. With New England's offense sputtering 
in recent weeks, don't expect much from Vinatieri this week against the 
Bengals.    

 Rod Rutledge , TE NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last Sunday against the Browns, 
including his first career touchdown. With the release of Erich Bjornson, he 
should become more involved in the Patriots' offense in the coming weeks.  If 
you relied on Bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to 
pickup Rutledge.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/00 
 Pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. 
He has missed four of his last six games, but Coach Jeff Fisher says that he 
is improving. Pickens will likely be a gametime decision.  

 Bashir Yamini , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide 
receiver. One possibility is to sign Yamini, who is on the practice squad and 
was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace Chris Jackson, who will be 
out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. Jackson 
had recently been signed off the practice squad.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 George was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. He plans on 
getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough 
to play Sunday against Cleveland. The only real concern here is whether 
George may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. Keep a close eye on 
him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, Rodney Thomas.  

 Wade Richey , K SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal 
tries.  Last year Richey made 21-of-23 attempts.  He should get a lot of 
attempts this week against the Falcons.  San Francisco should be able to move 
the chains against Atlanta, but with Terrell Owens suffering from turf toe, 
The Niners will have problems scoring touchdowns.    

 Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Beasley missed last Sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries 
and remains questionable for this week.  Terry Jackson will start at fullback 
if Beasley is unable to play.  In the beginning of the season the Niners 
threw to Beasley in goal-line situations.  Recently they have chosen to let 
Charlie Garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts.   Beasley scored 
five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then.    

 Jerry Rice , WR SF - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/00 
 Rice sat out of practice Wednesday to rest his sore back.  He is expected to 
play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report.  Rice had five 
catches for 59 yards in the season opener against Atlanta.  At this point in 
his career Rice has very little Fantasy value.  He is being used mainly for 
routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations.    

 Chad Dukes , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 To add depth to its backfield, St. Louis has signed Dukes, who spent time on 
the Redskins' roster earlier this season.  Dukes will probably be the backup 
halfback against the Redskins Monday behind Justin Watson.  Regular backup 
Trung Canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist Sunday.   
 

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach Mike Martz said he 
will play against the Redksins Monday.  This week's matchup could be the 
ultimate test for the Rams' receiving team this week as they go up against 
one of the best secondaries in the league.  Start all of your Rams receivers 
as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle.    

 Andrew Glover , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Glover sat out practice Tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable 
for Sunday's game against the Raiders.  He may catch a lot of passes against 
his former team this week.  The Saints are thin on offense, with Ricky 
Williams and Jake Reed sidelined by injury, so Glover could get a lot of 
balls thrown his way.  The Raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes 
this season.  Denver TEs combined for 125 yards and a TD against them last 
week.  Kansas City TE Tony Gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against 
Oakland in Week 10.    

 Chris Hetherington , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career Sunday 
against the Vikings.  Hetherington will be filling in for the injured William 
Floyd who suffered broken ribs last week.  He is not as gifted offensively as 
Floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments.     

 Kris Mangum , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Mangum exited last Sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return 
due to a sprained shoulder.  Mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more 
flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at 
Minnesota.  "We'll see," Mangum told the Rock Hill Herald .  "I tried last 
week. I guess I came back a little early. We'll try again this week and see 
what happens."  Mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the 
injured Wesley Walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well.  
Rookie Casey Crawford will start at TE once again if Mangum is unable to play 
Sunday.        

 Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for 
a possible start against the Vikings Sunday.  Starter Tim Biakabutuka is 
suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at Minnesota.  At 
this point in the season selecting Hoover would be a gamble, even if he does 
start Sunday.  Carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 
79.4 yards per game.  It might be safer to use a starting back from another 
team even if the player hasn't been too productive.    

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Kitna was named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week yesterday after 
passing for three touchdowns in Seattle's 28-21 victory over Jacksonville.  
His reward?  A return to the bench, in all likelihood.  He is expected to be 
the backup to Brock Huard after the bye in a November 26th game against the 
Denver Broncos.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 Owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time 
in the team's 21-7 win over Kansas City.  Head coach Steve Mariucci is 
seriously considering holding Owens out of this week's game.  Owens still 
leads the NFL in TD receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf 
toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season.  If he can't play 
Sunday wideout J.J. Stokes would make his second straight start in place of 
him.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against Denver.  Head 
Coach Mike Riley stated earlier in the week that Jim Harbaugh would be the 
starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a 
decision.  Look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows 
it.    

 Jim Harbaugh , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Harbaugh was named the starter for Sunday's game against the Broncos earlier 
in the week, but Head Coach Mike Riley may now be retracting that statement.  
Ryan Leaf took an equal number of snaps as Harbaugh in practice on Wednesday, 
and may get the nod on Sunday.  Riley said that he plans to wait another day 
or two before announcing a starter.  If at all possible, go with another 
quarterback this week.     

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/00 
 Jacksonville will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson and Lonnie Marts, 
and probably without cornerback Aaron Beasley, for Sunday's game in 
Pittsburgh. Nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the 
last two recovering from knee surgery, went to California yesterday for a 
second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. Marts is still recovering 
from a groin injury, and Beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury 
but is unlikely to play. Rookie T.J. Slaughter, Erik Storz and Jason Craft 
would get the starts at their respective positions. Pittsburgh has a subpar 
passing game, but its running game, led by Jerome Bettis, could give the 
Jaguars' defense fits come Sunday.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/00 
 Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Saints.  He 
didn't play in Monday night's loss to the Broncos, and will be re-evaluated 
by Head Coach Jon Gruden during practice the rest of the week.  Oakland is 
reportedly talking about signing running back Terry Kirby for this week's 
game, which could be a bad sign if you have Wheatley on your Fantasy 
roster.
