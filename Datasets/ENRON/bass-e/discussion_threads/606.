=09
=09Q: I know Shaun Rogers' play has been limited since his ankle sprain aga=
inst=20
Houston. How many snaps has he been getting over the last several games? At=
=20
one point during the Tech game, I thought I saw Adam Doiron and Marcus Tubb=
s=20
on the field at the same time playing tackle. I know these freshmen are=20
playing great, but I figured either Shawn or Casey Hampton would always be =
on=20
the field to give the line the benefit of their experience. Please provide =
a=20
rundown of the tackle rotation. =20
=09?? Dan McCrory=20
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Rogers has been getting between 20 and 30 snaps per game. But t=
hat=20
high ankle sprain has really taken a toll. He's not the same player he was=
=20
before the Houston game. Still, he wants to stay out on the field, even=20
though he is not 100 percent. Tubbs and Doiron were out on the field togeth=
er=20
against Tech for several plays - several key plays. Mack Brown said Tubbs a=
nd=20
Doiron had the quickness to hold their own against Tech's inexperienced,=20
undersized offensive line. I don't know how often you'll see a tackle tande=
m=20
that doesn't include Casey Hampton, but against Tech, the coaches felt they=
=20
would have to play four defensive ends and four defensive tackles. That's=
=20
because of the number of pass rushers needed to get pressure on the QB.=20
Against a running team, you probably would see Hampton as part of the DT=20
tandem in the game.=20

cruciate ligament in his right knee. He is questionable for Texas A=02?on N=
ov.=20
24. WR Artie Ellis (shin) is out for Saturday. CB Ervis Hill (shoulder) is=
=20
out for the season and may need surgery. DT Ryan Haywood (shoulder) is out=
=20
for the season and has already undergone surgery. SS Lee Jackson (quadricep=
s)=20
is questionable, and LB O.J. McClintock (knee) is probable. Coaches would=
=20
like to get McClintock back on the field this week on special teams.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I noticed you mentioned in one of your articles that Texas was still=
=20
trying to put together its first complete game of the season. I couldn't=20
agree more. I don't recall a season where we really haven't played a good=
=20
game yet this late in the season, especially given the talent we are puttin=
g=20
on the field. I'm also concerned about the number of penalties we are=20
committing. I've read that Mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and emotion=
,=20
but I watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and remain=20
disciplined. Do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just youth?=
=20
=09?? Ken Hines, Wichita Falls=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes told me this week that the team thought i=
t=20
would go out to Stanford and win easily. In other words, the team took the=
=20
Cardinal lightly. Thus, when the Cardinal played the Longhorns tough (and=
=20
ultimately won), Texas got tight and struggled. I think this season has bee=
n=20
one with little to get up for. The teams on UT's schedule were - for the mo=
st=20
part - awful. Texas knew going into the season that it was going to be at=
=20
least a 10-point favorite in every game except for Oklahoma and Texas A&M.=
=20
The Longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record - Texas Tech.=
=20
My point is, once Texas suffered the shock of losing to Stanford, it lost=
=20
some of its sense of urgency. Its dream of a national title - realistic or=
=20
unrealistic - was over. By the time Texas played Oklahoma, the Longhorns ha=
d=20
played only a couple halves of complete football - the second half against=
=20
Louisiana-Lafayette and the second half against Oklahoma State. That wasn't=
=20
nearly enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the Sooners. F=
or=20
whatever reason (some will argue it was the QB rotation), the offensive=20
coaches weren't able to instill an identity or swagger into their players.=
=20
Whether this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because the=
=20
team couldn't get up for the Houstons and Baylors of the world, only the=20
coaches and players really know. But, in my opinion, Texas has not yet put =
a=20
complete game together - nine games into the season. And it's because of th=
e=20
offense. The defense has been solid with the exception of Oklahoma. The=20
offense has been slow starting, erratic and even predictable. To UT's credi=
t,=20
the offense is about to set a single-season passing yardage record by=20
averaging 289.4 yards passing per game. If Texas wins its next two games an=
d=20
wins its bowl game, the Longhorns would be 10-2 and that would be an=20
improvement over last year and hard to argue with. So, perhaps Texas can ta=
ke=20
the fire it showed in the first quarter against Tech and put its first=20
complete game together this week. A three-game winning streak to end the=20
season would be a great launch pad into next season, when UT will again hav=
e=20
a chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling dummies.=20

=09 Q: I am thinking that palm trees and balmy sunsets may be in the Longho=
rns'=20
immediate holiday plans: either the Orange Bowl, if all goes perfectly, or=
=20
more likely the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego. Do you think Mack Brown=
=20
would relish a game against Rick Neuheisel? Texas vs. Washington would make=
=20
for great TV, and a wonderful trip for the 'Horns and their many fans.=20
=09?? James K. Sterrett=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is a better question for next week because we'll know the=
=20
outcome of the Texas A&M-Oklahoma game. If Oklahoma and Nebraska both win o=
ut=20
and meet in the Big 12 title game, a narrow Nebraska win would probably lan=
d=20
both in a BCS bowl game. A narrow Oklahoma win might still land them both i=
n=20
the BCS. But a lopsided win by either Oklahoma or Nebraska would probably=
=20
mean the winner going to a BCS bowl game and the loser going to the Cotton.=
=20
If A=02?loses to Oklahoma and UT beats Kansas, the winner of the UT-A=02?ga=
me would=20
probably be playing for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo=
=20
Bowl. The Holiday Bowl opponent would appear to be either Oregon State or=
=20
Washington. The Alamo Bowl opponent would appear to be either Michigan or=
=20
Ohio State. I think any of those opponents would probably catch the attenti=

always been my opinion that referees' calls were  just part of the game and=

if you're not good enough to overcome some bad  calls, well, you're just no=
t=20
good enough. That said, however, we seem to  have some of the worst calls=
=20
going against us in the last few years and in  almost every game. Are the=
=20
officials held to any standard by the Big 12 or  an officiating group? If=

it's not the officials, we have got to do something  about all these=20
penalties. =20

t=20
talk about the penalties being called because he'll be fined by the Big 12,=
=20
he can complain to the officials on the field. And he can send a videotape =
of=20
calls that he thinks are questionable to the league office. And let's just=
=20
say Brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this season.=
=20
Brown is calling for instant replay in the college game. He said the NFL's=
=20
instant replay has shown how many calls are missed in a football game. He=
=20
hopes that schools will bite the bullet and vote in favor of this even thou=
gh=20
it would be a sizable expense to most schools and would slow the game down.=

=09
=09Q: Is there anything physically wrong with Kenny Hayter that is limiting=
 his=20
playing time? Or is this just the coaching staff's decision? I will be one =
of=20
the many to admit that Hodges Mitchell and the offensive line have looked a=
=20
lot better over the past four games. If Hayter had better per-carry numbers=
=20
than Mitchell with an underperforming offensive line, it would seem to me=
=20
that Hayter would also do well now that they are blocking better. I would=
=20
like to point out that I do not advocate benching Mitchell by any means, bu=
t=20
after this week's game and all of the talk I have heard about him being=20
durable or not, I think that a more balanced backfield would help out in th=
is=20
situation. =20
=09?? Jason Patton=20
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  The coaches have stuck with Mitchell because he is a senior lea=
der=20
on an offense that doesn't have many leaders and because he is such a=20
versatile threat as a running back and receiver. Mitchell has suddenly=20
climbed within 235 yards of a 1,000-yard rushing season (765 yards) and has=
=20
337 yards receiving (he'll surpass last year's 343 yards receiving). Mitche=
ll=20
has a 4.7-yard per carry average, the best on the team among RBs except for=
=20
Brett Robin, who has just five carries for 27 yards (5.4 yards per carry).=
=20
The coaches will stick with Mitchell from here on in because the offense=20
finally showed against Tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first hal=
f=20
of a game. Now, granted, it was against an undersized defensive line that=
=20
emphasized its quickness over bulk. But Mack Brown seems to think his team =
is=20
finally getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line of=20
scrimmage. Kansas has a salty defensive line, led by NG Nate Dwyer (6-3,=20
300). So, we'll see if the Longhorns' offensive line can continue to push=
=20
people around.=20

ible=20
redshirt status for next year?=20
=09?? Monte Boothe=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It's too early to tell. Mack Brown said he had a conversation w=
ith=20
Simms about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could seriousl=
y=20
be considered is after spring practice, if not next fall.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: It seems that many Horn fans are still in shock from the 63-14 debac=
le in=20
the Cotton Bowl and are wondering if OU is suddenly that far ahead of Texas=
=20
in the development of their respective programs. Are they? Or was this just=
 a=20
total meltdown by a young UT team? Can we expect better results next year a=
nd=20
if so, why?=20
=09?? Mark, Lewisville=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the OU coaches deserve a lot of credit for getting thei=
r=20
players to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both side=
s=20
of the ball. That kind of coaching job is what it's all about. But I don't=
=20
think you can underestimate the influence that Josh Heupel has had on that=
=20
team. He makes every part of that offense effective. Tremendous credit goes=
=20
to the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on tea=
ms=20
like Texas, Kansas State and Nebraska. This has been a phenomenal coaching=
=20
job. And no disrespect to OU, but next year, without Heupel, I think they=
=20
will drop off slightly (maybe 8-3). Maybe not. But it seems likely.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I thought Mack Brown's philosophy on redshirts is that he will take =
them=20
off ANY player at ANY point in the season if we need that player to help us=
=20
win. Does having Beau Trahan as the backup QB for Kansas give us a better=
=20
chance of winning the game (if Simms goes down) than Chance Mock? From what=
=20
Mack says, Mock is not even a consideration (since Courtnee Garcia is the=
=20
emergency QB).=20
=09?? Glen Shillinglaw, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think Brown is banking on the fact that Simms survives the Ka=
nsas=20
game and Major comes back to start or at least back up Simms in an emergenc=
y=20
situation against Texas A&M. On Tuesday, Mack Brown announced that Hunter=
=20
McWilliams, and not WR Courtnee Garcia, would be the team's third=20
quarterback. McWilliams, the son of former UT coach David McWilliams, runs=
=20
the scout team QB position in practice and has more experience handing off=
=20
this season than Garcia, who was an option QB at Lufkin. Brown said he woul=
d=20
take the redshirt off of Mock if he absolutely had to, meaning if both Simm=
s=20
and Applewhite went down with season-ending injuries. But he said to do so=
=20
right now would be premature because Simms is OK, and there's a chance that=
=20
Applewhite will be back for A&M.=20

=09 Q: Is there any chance for Texas to take the Big 12 South? Hopefully A=

OU this weekend, this can't hurt. =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Oklahoma would have to lose two of its last three games at Texa=
s=20
A&M, home against Texas Tech or at Oklahoma State. Texas would then have to=
