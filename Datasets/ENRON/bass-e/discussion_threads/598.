No biggie ... give me a call back when you get a chance to chat some more
:))

Yep, we ate at the rainforest ... the atmosphere is AWESOME ... definitely
worth eating there for the experience ... but, the food is nothing special
... different stuff to choose from but a little overpriced for the tastiness
....
anyway ... that's my rating :))
the one in orlando is much better than the one in houston ............

Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you back yesterday- swamped over here-
especially after being gone all of last week.

Keep me posted on what ya'll want to do for Michelle's birthday.

Didn't you tell me that ya'll had eaten once at the Rainforest Cafe?  How
was that?  Eric was asking me about it- and I thought I remembered you
telling me that you had went awhile back.
