=20
but he's also a Fantasy Football  Fanatic.? What a combination.? Like I do=
=20
with my Physician friends  when I need an injury insight, we'll be calling =
on=20
Mike to give us some headsup  on the weather situations in a few notable=20
games this week.? Thanks  Mike!

SEATTLE @ DENVER:? Winter Storm Watch  for Sunday in Colorado, but I still=

think the snows will hold off until at least  the 2nd half if not after the=
=20
game completely.? I'd feel comfortable  starting any player in this one at=
=20
this point.

(Joe's note:? Make sure to realize though that it'll  still be bitterly col=
d=20
with gusty winds likely.)

DETROIT @ GREEN  BAY:? The big weather factor in this one is not the snow,=
=20
but the  cold.? Snow flurries with temperatures in the 20s at kickoff that=
=20
will  likely fall into the teens by game's end.? The Packers (and their=20
crazed  "cheeseheads") don't seem to mind these weather conditions, but kee=
p=20
in mind  that Detroit plays in a dome.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS  CITY:? The rain, sleet and snow will not arrive in Kansa=
s=20
City  until late in the day on Sunday.? This is an early game and so weathe=
r=20
no  longer seems to be a concern.? However, falling thermometers and=20
barometers  are not good for sore bones and joints.? This could still be a=

=20
back and forth info.? Some  reports have the finger as broken, some do not.=

Some have his finger  troubles as the reason for his fumbles last week, som=

is=20
expected to  start.

RB Chris Warren was signed by the  Eagles.

*** Saturday Update RB Chris Warren  (Phi) was not one of the early=20

hasn't practiced all week but still says  he'll be able to go Sunday.? Says=
