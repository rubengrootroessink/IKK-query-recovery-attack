Hey,

How are things going with you guys?  We really enjoyed Saturday night out at the house.  We should get together more often.

How is Mr. Hamilton doing ? I was thinking of sending some flowers to either the hospital (if he is out of ICU) or the house.  Can you give me the address of either?

Love,
E
