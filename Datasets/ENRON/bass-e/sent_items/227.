Hi Eric,

I won't even ask about the mood at Enron today.

Dad's 60th birthday is 12/8.  Please reserve that day.  I will plan
something special, o.k.?  It may be a surprise so mum is the word.

Have a good day.  LU-M

Hi Eric,

How are you today?

I understand you are taking Friday off.  What's the occasion?  How many
vacation days do you have left?

Have a great day.  LU-M
