Subject: Tuxedos for the wedding


I wanted to try to set a day where we can all get fitted for our Tuxedos for the wedding.  I would like to get it done sometime in the very near future.  It should not take mor than a couple of hours.  Would you all be available Saturday December 29?  Please let me know if this date does not work.
