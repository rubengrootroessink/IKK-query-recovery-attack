Eric - it was good to see you again after all this time. Sounds like you are well on your way to making things happen for yourself. Anyway - I am definitely new in this town as far as I am concerned. So - I don't want to burden you with spending any time with my sorry ass - but to the extent that you want to grab your girlfriend and a friend of hers - I would always be willing to venture out. I definitely need to meet some new people. In any event, I'm sure that we will run into each other plenty at the gym, etc. Talk to you soon Eric.
