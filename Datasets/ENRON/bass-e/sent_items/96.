Yo!  How are you today?  Did you get your Cipro?

Thanks again for the beautitul flowers, one of the most beautiful I have
ever seen, by the way.  They still look good.

No decision yet on Dec.  I'll check it out this afternoon, o.k.?  I would
think the lst week, maybe 12/3-9 to celebrate your Dad's birthday - shhh.
Talk to you later.

Love, Mom
