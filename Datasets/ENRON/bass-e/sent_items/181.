Texas stinks!  As I said before, Chris Simms is the best 5 yard passer in college football history.  When the game is on the line, he chokes!  After he turned the ball over 4 times, he had to fake like he sprained his pinky so that he could go and cry on the sideline.  Texas had to call on their savior from Baton Rouge, but it was a little too late for Major to erase the mistakes of Sissy Simms.

Oh well, I have to get my licks in while I can.  Geaux Tigers!
