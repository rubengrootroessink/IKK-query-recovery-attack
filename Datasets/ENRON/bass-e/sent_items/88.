new orleans was fun.  the wedding was nice and it was good to get away for the weekend.  how was your weekend?
as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.  i think in the short term we will definately see the teens.

How was your trip? Unless it is discovered that Enron has done something illegal or committed shareholder fraud (each of which I find highly unlikely), I think the market has overreacted to the Enron partnership info. I like the price @ 22-23. Dad

sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.  as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.  i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.  i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.  i might just sell now and look to buy backl ower.
 
let me know what you think

Good morning. Do you have any advice about whether I should unload ENE? Seems it cannot take a forward step without then taking 3 steps back. I have never seen a company so effectively shoot itself in the foot. What do you think?-L
