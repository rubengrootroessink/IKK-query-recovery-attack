Hello from Inside FERC,

(Sorry for the double send.  This version has the price form attached)

Tomorrow (Wednesday) is the last business day of October, and it's the fina=
l
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's November 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. The=
y
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held i=
n
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Wednesday, Oct. 31.

November monthly prices will be published on Thursday, Nov. 1.

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.


Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Kelley Doolan, chief editor
