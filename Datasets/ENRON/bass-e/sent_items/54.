Hey Mom,
 
Things are going well.  I heard you guys had a good time at the shower.  
I don't know Michael's address but I will get it.
 
When are we going to get together?
 
-Eric

Hi Eric,
 
How are you today?  Long time no see.
 
Do you know Michael B's address offhand?  Donnita needs it for an invitation.
 
Have a good day.  LU-M
