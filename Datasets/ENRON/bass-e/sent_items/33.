Hi Eric,
 
I am excited that you will get back to work now.  I know you don't like being bored.
 
Sorry about Tahoe.  Las Vegas sounds interesting.  I'll talk to Dad.  I talked with Vivian this morning and we are planning on a golf trip maybe to Mexico.  I don't know when we will be going.  Las Vegas is not my first choice for a vacation after such a long time without one.  However, I welcome any opportunity to spend time with our son.  I'll talk with him tonight and let you know.
 
Have a great weekend.  Hi to Shanna.
 
Love you, Mom

Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
 
We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
 
Let me know.
 
-Eric
