Alright last e-mail:

We got clarification on the rooms.  The Pkg deal stays the same but if you want to get just the room with 2 breakfasts each day it is $79/night - if you want the Premium Room ( the only difference is that the Premium room has jets in the tub) then it is $103/night with no breakfast $115/night with breakfast.
