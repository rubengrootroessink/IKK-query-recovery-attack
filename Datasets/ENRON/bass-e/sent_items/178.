Hey Brett,

Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at Enron.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.  
Oh well, things will work out.

As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the Rose Bowl this year).  The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).  If either one loses (Miami at Virginia Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.  Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.  This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.

Good luck on the proposal.  You are about to venture to the Dark Side.  Telluride should be fun.  We went there last year for a ski trip (again).  I might be venturing down that path soon.

I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).  

Take Care.

Eric

Hey Eric,

Christ almighty, u still got a job?  I bought into Enron at $38 or so..... 
now they're at 0.61.  I really know how to pick'em.  I lost about 1,300 on 
ENE.  I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped 
about it.

What all events would have to occur for us to get a Rose Bowl slot?

Yeah, I'm still in HI for another year to year and a half.  I'm going to 
Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing 
then I leave Hou on the 2nd of Jan.  So if ur in town from 27 dec to 02 jan 
lemme know.
