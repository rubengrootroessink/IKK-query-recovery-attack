  some accounting and billing, but i'm working in the commercial group doing
advertising and support to the engineers for the most part.  the company is

great, we just celebrated 15 years of business last month. it is a small
firm, and many of the staff members are pretty young, i am still the
youngest, however.  i found the job online, and i liked it after the first
interview.

my sisters are doing great, jacqui is a senior at lamar, and dominique is
working towards her last year of school and then she has a year of student
teaching. she has been dating hunter sage for almost 3 years now.  he is in

his first year of law school at UT.  jacqui's boyfriend of a year and 2
months (they celebrated last week) is also a senior at lamar.  really great

guy! i think when i buy the townhouse, dominique will probably move in with

me, her student teaching is unpaid, so she will be looking for a free
place,
i'm sure.  jacqui is not sure about next year, she wanted to go to art
school in new york, and my family took a vacation there in august of this
year, but now with everything going on, she is not sure.  i think i may
start taking some graduate classes next fall at U of H, but i'm still
researching what i want to study.  any vacations for you recently?

i'm really glad you wrote me back, i've been thinking about you and
wondering what you have been doing for a while.  take care.

danielle
