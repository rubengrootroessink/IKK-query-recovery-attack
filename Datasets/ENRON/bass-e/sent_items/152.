I think if we had to recover our money from Renaissance, it would be difficult. However, the fact we charged it all on Platinum Amex, and the insurance coverage the card provides for goods/services not received and/or defective, we should receive from Amex 100% of the money, just like the letter said with was faxed to you by Amex this a.m. You did good dear. However, looks like Eric lost all his money because he wrote us a check, which is not covered. Too bad. LU-L7

What do you think?
Renaissance may not be able to repay millions of dollars in passenger deposits. Unlike most U.S.-based cruise lines, it does not sail ships from U.S. ports and so has not posted the customary $15 million bond with the U.S. Maritime Commission to protect cruise passengers.
