Brian.   Things are pretty hectic right now.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.  Dynegy acquired Enron (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.  Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.  I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.  Of course, now that Enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.  Good luck on finals and keep in touch.
 
Your Pal,
 
Eric

Hey, Eric.  How are things in Houston?  I can't believe everything that's going on at Enron right now.  Who ever would have thought Enron would be appealing to Dynegy to buy them?  I'm sure things are pretty crazy right now.  Are you planning to stay on if this goes through?  Not too much new to report here.  Classes are going well, but they're keeping me busy as usual.  It's starting to get really cold here, so I'm going to miss the Houston winter.  I just got an email from Ashley that he and Lani got engaged a couple of days ago.  I doubt you see them too often, but I thought you'd be interested.  Hope things are going well for you.
 
Brian
