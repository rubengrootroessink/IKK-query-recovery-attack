whatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do. but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!! so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....
