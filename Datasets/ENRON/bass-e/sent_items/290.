No, I can go to Best Buy and get it.  I just wanted to make sure you were still in.  If you want to just order it, you can, but I was just making sure it was what you wanted to do.

Well the bottom one I think would be best.  Amazon has free shipping now.  But I just Saw that Best Buy has it for 188 instead of 199.
