Harry,

Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  Things are so bad at work right now. I have nothing to do whasoever.  I get in to work around 9 am and leave around 12:30 every day.  I hope all is going well in the job search.

I saw your add/drop request for the Pats. If you want me to add the Steelers as well just let me know.

Also, you might want to practice, "Would you like to SuperSize that?"

-Eric

Eric:

I trust everything is going well as Enron.  I am actively pursuing a job out
here at Mcdonalds.  "Would you like fries with that"...I practice on a
regular basis.

In any case, I would like to pick up the Patriots Defense and the Steelers
Defense as free agent pick ups, if still possible.  I would like to drop
Engram and the Titans defense. Please let me know.

Thanks
Harry Bucalo
