Congratulations on the wedding!  A sister, finally!  I'm sure your family is
really excited!  As for Enron, you are right, things will happen for the
best.  They always do for you, Ner.

I know what it is like to go through changes, I feel as though I have had so
many over the past year.  Luckily, it seems as though they have all been for
the best.

I'm glad you responded, it is always nice to hear about you and your family!
  I'm always interested in hearing what is going on in your life.

I saw your brother's friend, James not too long ago, I'm not sure if he
recognized me at first or not, but he said hello.  Tell you brother
congratulations for me please, and the family "hi."

Dee
