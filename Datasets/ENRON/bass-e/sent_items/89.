sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.  as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.  i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.  i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.  i might just sell now and look to buy back lower.
 
let me know what you think

Good morning. Do you have any advice about whether I should unload ENE? Seems it cannot take a forward step without then taking 3 steps back. I have never seen a company so effectively shoot itself in the foot. What do you think?-L
