Yeah, I actually read that yesterday.  
 
Have you ever been to Lawton or Ft. Sill, OK.  Knowing that area,  I understand his view of OK.  I did think 
it was funny though his pointing out the "Bingo" sign being the first thing you see when you cross into OK on I-44. 
I'll take that over the adult video sign on the south banks of the Red R. right beside I-35.  And no, I am not
and have never been a patron.
 
You don't have any spare tickets do you?
