hey brian,
the holidays were good.  it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work.  how were your's? and how is the job search going?
i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league.  i think that you get 25% of the pot for 2nd place.
the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.  how do you think they will be next year?
 
 
oh well, i hope things are going well.  lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon.
 
-eric

Hey Bass, what's up? I hope you had a nice Christmas/New Year's.  So, what
does second place pay? and what do I owe for that other league? and I owe
you $40 (20 for the Auburn LSU tickets, and 20 for Texas ending up higher in
the polls than LSU, I'll admit that bet was a lot closer than I thought it
would be at the end of the season, Geaux Tigers!!) So let me know if I still
have any money coming to me or if I'm in the red. Take it easy,
Bryan
