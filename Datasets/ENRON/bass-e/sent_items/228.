i agree with your comments about managament.  it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights.  i have bought some more shares today.  my view is that the company will not fold.  the worst case scenario is a buyout. so, it seems like we should bottom out shortly.  right?
 
good news on uncle george

Well, I certainly called this one wrong! I was absolutely convinced that the market was drastically overeating to that ENE/partnership deal, that all was above board and that ENE could and would financially manage the matter. However, the stock has lost 50% of its value in less than 4 trading days and 90% of its value in less than a month and yet there is TOTAL silence from management. All you read are the doom and gloom wall street  articles. I must now believe they are true. Are these guys just a bunch of crooks? I guess I should  just take the lump. As much as I hate to,it may be the wise thing to do and try to salvage $8/share. Any thoughts?
 
On a lighter note, talked with Uncle George and he will be delighted to join us for Thanksgiving. Told him I would let him know when we will eat. That's about all for now. LU-:L

Hi Dear,
 
Eric said the mood is somber over there today.  I just can't believe my eyes!  Why doesn't management DO something? LU-T
