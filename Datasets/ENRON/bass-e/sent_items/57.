Hey Brian,

Long time no hear.  How are things at Harvard?  I trust you had a good holiday period.  Are you still in Kentucky or back in Boston?
How was the first round of finals?

Things are good down here.  I stayed in Houston for the holidays.  I still have a job.  The big date for us (in the trading group) is this Friday. That is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group.  Hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that.  I really have done now work for the past 2 months.  Mostly just sitting around and researching mutual funds and doing crossword puzzles.  I have been coming in to work around 9 and leaving at about 2 everyday.

What oral surgeon did you go to to get your wisdom teeth out? Tim needs to get his out and was wondering if you recommended the surgeon that did yours?

Drop me a line when you get a chance.

-Eric
