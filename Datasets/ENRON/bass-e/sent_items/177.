Tom (my boss) does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus, but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down.  He did, however, tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by Enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company.

What do you think?
