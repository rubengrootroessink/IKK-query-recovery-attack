I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Eric
