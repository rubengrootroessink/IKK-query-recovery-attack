I have bought my suits from a custom tailor for years, though have not
bought a suit for several years. I recommend Wall Street Clothiers, Pat
McLaughlin, 281-360-7891. Price is reasonable. He comes to you with swatches
and style books. You do not leave your office. Dad

Where is a good place to buy a suit?  Where do you shop? A friend of
mine is asking.


Thanks,
Eric
