Dear eric,




 

The Rockets tip off the 2001-2002 regular season tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. against the Atlanta Hawks at Compaq Center. The first 14,000 fans entering Compaq Center will receive a new 2001-2002 Rockets magnetic schedule, courtesy of Miller Lite. In addition, Rockets representatives will distribute small, American Flags to the first 2,000 fans. 

You can purchase your tickets for Tuesday's game at any Ticketmaster outlet, the Compaq Center box office, or by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX. You may also order tickets online at rockets.com. (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=127374&UID=45456540&MID=182309)

The game will feature a special ceremony including presentation of $86,000 to the Twin Towers Fund, which will go to assist families of uniformed service heroes in New York City. Fans can also show their patriotic support for our nation by putting their signature on a giant 15-foot tall, 50-feet wide banner, presented by 950 KPRC-AM, which will be sent to New York City.

Please be sure to get to the arena early to accommodate the new security measures now in place at Compaq Center. These new measures include:

There will be an increased security presence both inside and outside
Compaq Center Briefcase-size bags and pocketbooks will be allowed in Compaq
Center, but will be inspected at all entrance gates Large bags, coolers and large backpacks will not be allowed in
Compaq Center Once they have exited, fans will not be allowed to re-enter Compaq
Center for any reason All vehicles without proper identification must be parked at least
100 feet from Compaq Center, in arena-controlled parking areas All media and others with access to restricted areas will be
required to produce a photo ID, and all bags and equipment will be subject
to inspection

(Donations to the Twin Towers Fund were made possible with proceeds raised
from ticket sales and a special silent auction at the Clutch City Classic on
October 11, 2001, when the Rockets hosted the Dallas Mavericks during the
preseason home opener.)
