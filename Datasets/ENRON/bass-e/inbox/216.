Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Alex Van Pelt threw for 219 yards and 0 TDs with 1 Interception last week.
He threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught.
Peerless Price is also still a prime target.   TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry
Centers will see plenty of short throws.   The Falcons rank # 30 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs so they've pretty much been weak all year defending the pass.


Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

It'll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff
victories this week.   If you've got to go with one, Joey Galloway suddenly
become Carter's favorite target last week.  Go figure.   Just when you
thought he was locking on Rocket Ismail.   Both guys are risks.   Even with
Arizona ranked # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Great matchup, but I just don't have
a lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of it.


Oakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Yes, Brett Favre and the Packers didn't do much against the Titans last
week.   But in my opinion, you just can't bench Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice or
Tim Brown.   They're just too good and are too liable to explode at any
time.   The Titans rank # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks so clearly, people are throwing on them.   For the year, they
rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.   Start your Raiders.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Hard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying Fantasy Teams right now.
He's been awesome and isn't showing any signs that I can see of letting up.
The one factor he'd been missing, he now seems to have in abundance -
Confidence.   Hines Ward wasn't a big factor receiving but he's a great bet.
Plaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the
charts.   The Lions are fired up but still rank # 20 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Start your Rams.   Warner, Bruce and Holt are sure starters.   Yes, it's
tough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner spreads the ball around.
But I don't see how you can have either of these guys benched as you could
leave a ton of points on the table.   Carolina ranks # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Tim Couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from Browns fans for not
being a very accurate passer last week.   Seeing as how not one of the
20,000 bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref, I'd guess
the fans might want to keep their day jobs...   Couch wasn't very effective
last week with 184 yards, 0 TDs and 1 Interception.   Normally reliable WR
Kevin Johnson came up small as well.   I still have faith in Johnson as he's
shown too much this year to discount him over one game.   The Packers rank #
22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Trent Green's finally coming around.   Either that, or he's just teasing
us...   With the dominant running of Priest Holmes, Green is finding room to
throw.   Marvin Minnis and Derrick Alexander are doing well.   Tony Gonzalez
isn't as involved as his owners would like but he's a sure starter in TE
leagues.   The Chargers rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

The hits just keep rolling for Minnesota.   QB Todd Bouman's thumb is
causing serious worry.   Enough that there's talk that Spergon Wynn could
get the start.   Stay tuned on this one.   Randy Moss has clearly decided to
play lately and will wind up with season long stats that'll make all the non
Moss owners wonder what all the Moss guys were complaining about early on.
Cris Carter is definitely taking a backseat to Moss lately.   The Jaguars
rank # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

The Jets are tough to call lately.   Testeverde threw for 196 yards and did
manage 2 TDs.   But Laveranues Coles didn't do a lot.   (Although Chris
Berman's call of "Laveranues Coles 'shopping' for 18 yards" was classic on
the Prime Time highlights...)   Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course
Anthony Becht caught the TD but not much else.   All in all, a risky place
for FF passing game material.   Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch.
The Colts rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

The passing game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley.
That's ok as long as they get the yards.   Todd Pinkston and James Thrash
have been inconsistent.   They'll face a 49er team that's been pretty soft
lately ranking # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

I never thought I'd be writing about the pass happy Titans but that's the
case.   Steve McNair has been awesome lately and ranks as the # 2 QB in the
league over the last 3 games.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are starters
in just about every league.   TE Frank Wycheck is producing like always.
The Raiders rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Atlanta Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

It's tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week he played very well
throwing for 249 yards and 2 TDs.   Tony Martin seems to be coming on a bit.
We said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored.   He's not on the field
enough (yet) to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out there.
RB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well.   This
week, they'll face a Buffalo defense ranked # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Elvis Grbac managed 2 TDs with just 159 yards Sunday night.   Picking a
receiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail / Stokely / Taylor
all in the mix.   TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet.   This week, they'll
face the Bengals ranked # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Terry Allen should be more of a
factor in this one as well.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

I can't imagine benching Brett Favre right now.   He seems to get better as
it gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after
losing to Tennessee Sunday.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both
should be ready to play.   The Browns have been tough lately ranking # 8 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Mark Brunell posted 202 yards , 1 TD and 2 Interceptions Sunday.   Keenan
McCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual.   They're two of the
steadiest guys in the league.   It's surprising, but Minnesota's been tough
lately against the pass ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs New England Defense

The problem with Jay Fiedler is that when he's ugly, he's really ugly.   If
you started him Sunday, you know what I mean.   149 yards, 0 TDs and 3
Interceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone.   Oronde Gadsden
was injured to boot.   Gasden said he'll be ready Sunday.   Chris Chambers
still has tons of upside if you're ready to roll the dice.   New England
ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Doug Flutie threw 3 Interceptions Sunday with 0 TDs.   Another day like that
and he'll see Drew Brees finishing the game.   You might see Brees anyway as
they'll want to start taking a look at their QB of the future.   Jeff Graham
and Curtis Conway continue to play well.  Tim Dwight could miss another game
due to his lung problem.   TE Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own
him, he's probably a starter for you.   Kansas City ranks # 16 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

With 152 yards, 0 Interceptions and 0 TDs, you can say at least Hasselbeck
didn't do anything to hurt the Seahawks.   Darrell Jackson is the clear # 1
guy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes.   The Giants rank
# 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Johnson threw an ugly game last week with 191 yards, 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   If a team finds a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson, the
passing game is gone.   Granted, most teams have trouble keeping Keyshawn
from getting his catches, but the over reliance on one receiver severely
restricts the offense in my opinion.   Warrick Dunn saw plenty of passes
Sunday but it wasn't enough.   At this point, Keyshawn is the only
consistent starter in this passing game.   New Orleans ranks # 17 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St. Louis game
Monday night.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Carolina Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Surely, you're not down to Chris Weinke are you?   Even with a week to rest,
I'm not excited about their prospects.   Muhsin Muhammad might be an option
for some teams.   TE Wesley Walls just doesn't seem to consistently get on
the same page as Weinke.   The Rams rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Don't even go there.   Maybe Peter Warrick in a stretch if you're desperate
but that's pretty much it.   This team is all about Corey Dillon.
Unfortunately, the Ravens picked up on that as well.   They rank # 31 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with 811 passing
yards allowed in 3 games.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even so, I'd
still avoid.


Detroit Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

Mike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good story of the week Sunday as they
beat the Vikings.   Hats off to them and their fans.   They kept playing
hard.   Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely showed some flashes of
talent with his scrambling ability.   He threw for 241 yards with 0 TDs but
also 0 Interceptions.   Johnnie Morton is the clear cut # 1 Guy but Scottie
Anderson did well too.   The Steelers rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on them.
For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Start Aaron Brooks.   Like you need me to tell you that.   Joe Horn and
probably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well.   Looks like
Cam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE.
These guys are hot.   Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in
one of his ribs but is expected to play.   You have to think this will at
least throw a little more focus on the passing game though.   The Bucs rank
# 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're
tough.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Collins has been up and down.   He did have 2 TDs last week but only threw
for 147 yards.   Amani Toomer was the clear # 1 Guy with Ike Hilliard
apparently hurting.   Ron Dixon got into the action with a TD but he's
inconsistent.   The Seahawks rank a very solid # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

The 49ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs
of Garrison Hearst and the RB corps to victory.   Jeff Garcia did very
little throwing for 133 yards and a TD.   He'll likely be needed more this
week.   Terrell Owens is still his clear cut go to guy.   Garcia could make
the Eagles pay with their blitz happy defense.   Philadelphia ranks # 12 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Tony Banks struggled last week throwing for 213 yards, 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok but not
great lately.   TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his way
again.   He's worth a shot if you're in need of a TE.   The Bears have
improved lately against the pass ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Jake Plummer played decent last week with 207 yards and 1 TD.   David Boston
is a must start at WR.   For you guys desperate for a TE, look at Twayn
Mitchell who had 7 catches for 62 yards a TD.   You could do a lot worse.
We'll see if he can keep that up.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so
this will be no cakewalk.


Chicago Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Jim Miller isn't carrying anyone's FF Team lately.   Although his 190 yards
and 2 TDs Sunday weren't bad.   Marty Booker is still seeing a ton of balls
thrown his way.   And Dez White is seeing action.   David Terrell makes the
most of what he gets but he's not seeing a lot of passes.   This team is
about Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football.   They'll have occasional
outbursts of big plays but primarily, it's Thomas.   The Redskins have been
very good lately ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

We got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for 325 yards and 3
TDs with 1 Interception.   He's been up and down so let's see if he can keep
it up.   Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie
Wayne's seeing lots of passes too.   TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in
the game plan last week as well.   The Jets rank # 4 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchup.


New England Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Tom Brady continues his slide back to Earth.   He threw for 237 yards, 0 TDs
and 1 Interception last week.   But the Patriots won and that's all they
care about.   Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenn's return.   Brown,
Glenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of
opportunities.   The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking # 6 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.
