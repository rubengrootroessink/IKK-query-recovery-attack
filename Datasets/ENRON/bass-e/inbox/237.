SAINTS EXPECT WILLIAMS TO START AND PLAY AS USUAL...
Posted Thursday December 20, 2001 @ 23:30 PT


According to reports out of New Orleans, Saints running back Ricky Williams,
who is listed as questionable after coming out of Monday night's loss to the
Rams with a hairline fracture to a rib, practiced without difficulty
Thursday and head coach Jim Haslett expects him to start and play as usual
against the Buccaneers this weekend.

In fact, New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Jeff Duncan wrote on Thursday,
"Williams was upgraded from questionable to probable and is expected to play
Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and Thursday and will wear a protective wrap
on his ribs Sunday. ..."

Duncan further noted that New Orleans' offense, led by Williams' rushing and
a resurgent Aaron Brooks in the passing game, is overshadowed by the
defense, but the unit is on pace to put together the most prolific season in
club history. The Saints currently rank sixth in the league in total offense
(355.1 yards per game) and are well ahead of pace to set a new single-season
club record for total yardage in a season.

If they can average 338 yards a game in the final three outings, they'll
break the 1979 mark of 5,627 yards.

************* Our View *******************

This is good news but certainly, we're not without concern here.   Their are
really a couple of worries here.  First, you're concerned with re-injury.
He may feel good now but one tough shot and it could be a whole new issue.
Not saying the Bucs are a team that plays dirty, but you can bet a hard
hitter like John Lynch smells blood in the water.   Secondly, you worry
about Deuce McAllister.   He's shown some big play flashes and could steal
time.   Thirdly, you have to be a little concerned with coach Jim Haslett
and the success of the passing game.   Williams has seemed to be taking a
somewhat reduced role of late.   Part of that could be getting into a track
meet with St. Louis Monday night.   All in all, the news is good for
Williams compared to what it was earlier this week.   But he is not without
concerns.   Although to be fair, few players are without concerns at this
point in the season.

Just wanting to pass along what we're hearing.   Thanks Bob.

Joe
