This is completely f-ing absurd.

Lets review:

Oct. 13
5-0 Texas A&M @ 5-1 Colorado NOT TELEVISED
4-1 Texas @ 2-3 Okla State Fox Syndication
6-0 Oklahoma @ 3-2 Kansas Fox SPorts Net

Oct. 27
6-1 Iowa State @ 6-1 Texas A&M NOT TELEVISED
8-0 Oklahoma @ 8-0 Nebraska ABC
6-2 Colorado @ 2-5 Okla State Fox Sports Net

Nov. 3
7-1 Texas A&M @ 5-3 Texas Tech NOT TELEVISED
7-1 Texas @ 2-7 Baylor FOX Syndication
8-1 or 9-0 Nebraska at 4-4 Kansas FOX Sports Net

So these sacks of sheep dip forego the ONLY GAME played between two winning
teams to show a pair of asskickings.
