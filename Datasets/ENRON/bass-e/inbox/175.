Hi Folks,

Another wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7
Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.

Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on
our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing
themselves.   This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent
memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.

From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com

One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching
Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams
fared less well as his starters.

My reply to him:

Don't be down on yourself.   That's the nature of the game.   There is no
way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was
such a question mark last week.   You did what just about every one of us
would have done I'm guessing.

It's part of the game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still
part of the game.   In my local league last week, I took a chance again on
Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 -
Aargh... )   Did it play out?   No, it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who
outscored him.   But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and
Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.

I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have to
take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do
the rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much.

If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started
him, well, that's your bad.   But if you got beat because Trung Canidate
decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did
not, well, that's not your fault.

I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit
your job and head to Vegas.

Control what you can control.   Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you
can do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be a better
owner because of it.

Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.

Have a great week, everyone.

Joe

Upgrades


QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks
deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an
interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots'
coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even
some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.   Right now, Brady
deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4
touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is starting to show
signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep in mind, a
tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense
improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper
league looking towards the future.

QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.  He's not the best
fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting
Flutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy,
Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With a strong
rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers
similar to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is
respectable against a tough Denver defense.

RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting
lineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears he'll be named the
official starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a touchdown on
Sunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think not.

RB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a
filler.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll
see more action even when Faulk is back.

RB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled to 4 consecutive 100-yard games.
Look for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers defense playing
excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis to have
more good games as the season progresses.

RB - Michael Pittman - We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon
and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing
80% of the carries and more importantly producing, all looks good for
Pittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of starting Cardinals' running
backs though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown performance, now
may be the time to deal Pittman.

RB - Jason Brookins (Waiver Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all
Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good
running behind a pretty solid offensive line, but his carries have been
limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting
other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline.
Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for
a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being
bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He
has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make
plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in
need of a receiver.

WR - David Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday
with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus
Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The
Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.
If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free
agent market, if he is still available.

WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season,
but he is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and
appears unstoppable at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury
late in the game and appears questionable for this week's game.

WR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to impress this season.  He has
surpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season and scored 3 touchdowns.
With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Morton becomes the
team's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better
than any defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is
averaging 96 receiving yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week.

WR - Jeff Graham - With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson
garnering a lot of attention, the receiving corps is able to see plenty of
open spaces downfield.  Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season
and gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look
for Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown passes this season.

WR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible,
Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a
touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the
title of "best rookie receiver".  Grab him, if he is available in your
league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

TE - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease
because "All he does is catch touchdowns".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If
only he can start picking up yardage points.

TE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase
the total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his
wide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high for a
little while longer.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades


QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers,
especially in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games,
Brooks is in a minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On
the flip side, an upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as
New Orleans faces: St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But
for now, we're a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our
fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once
again this week.  Without a consistent running game, look for Grbac's
struggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as
questionable for this week's game against Jacksonville.

QB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards and 3 touchdowns, many would think that
Batch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if the box scores were the only thing
studied, this would be the case.  However, the season ending injury to
Batch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives Batch a downgrade in my
book.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Batch must
rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not a
good sign.

QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything going against
the Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin,
Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time.
All in all, not a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage
numbers are poor this season.  However, he has thrown for multiple
touchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this season.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the
Steelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report
this week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners
can't be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates
will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news.

RB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries
during Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This is bad news for the
unproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear the 60-yard
mark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on this
situation.

RB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to
the Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the
game.  Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As
more of a straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury
and be somewhat effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions
may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any
kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade.

RB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for
the season.

RB - Terry Allen - Allen was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after
suffering an ankle injury on Sunday.  Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen
and looked decent.  If Allen misses any action, Brookins may replace him as
the team's starter with one good performance.  The Ravens are exploring
trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline, so the
Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time.

RB - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears
he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and
simple, Allen has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards
on 22 carries, Allen will be relegated to spot duty.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries
and 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense.  It was bound to happen
that a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson owners should be happy
that he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.  Just a slight
downgrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup.

WR - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for
the season.

WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost
for the season.

WR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain
that he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's game and
witnessed the "David Patten Show".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking
skills, look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury.
Previously, Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense.
Glenn can post dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy
owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season.

WR - Darney Scott - Scott's role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been
reduced in the last few weeks.  After suffering a rib injury that forced
Scott out of Sunday's game, Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a
consistent basis.  With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented
2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now appears to be the team's second
option in the passing game.

WR - Marvin Minnis - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense
since week 1.  With Sylvester Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready
to take over the role and produce quality numbers.  With Trent Green
struggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy impact has been minimal at best.
If Minnis is a starter on your roster, your receiving corps needs some
serious help.

Waiver Wire


QB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade
in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this
season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will
have a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup
by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

RB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has been named the team's starter after the
season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.  It was only a matter of time
before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again.  With the Panthers
facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley should pay instant
dividends.

RB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries in
replacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With the unproductive Bennett
suffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given the chance to earn the
team's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is available.

RB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs
to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind
a quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's
presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading
for another back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a
solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown
in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a
hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked
good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which
is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a
receiver.

WR - David Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches
for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson
suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson
injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're
in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market,
if he is still available.

WR - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is
impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with
another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of "best
rookie receiver".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is
the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

WR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the
season, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.  Foster is a
talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are in a deep
league and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team.
