Read Each One Carefully and Think About It a Second or Two


                   1. I love you not because of who you are, but because of 
who I am when I am with you.


                   2. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who 
is, won't make you cry.


                   3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want

them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.

                   4. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and

touches your heart.


                   5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right 
beside them knowing you can't have them.


                   6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never 
know who is falling in love with your smile.


                   7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person 
you may be the world.


                   8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't 
willing to waste their time on you.


                   9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before 
meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know

how to be grateful.


                   10. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it 
happened.


                   11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so 
what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who 
you trust next time around.


                   12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are 
before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.


                   13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you 
least expect them to.


                   REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.


                   True friends: How many people actually have 8 true 
friends?

                   Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right 
friends and good friends!!!
