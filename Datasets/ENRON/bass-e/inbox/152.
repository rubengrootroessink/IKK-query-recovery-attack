Hi Eric,
 
Sorry but Dad can't make it Thursday night.  Would dinner here on Friday be o.k. with you?  Dad suggested games, etc., and I wanted to bake a birthday cake.  We can either order in or I would love to cook anything you would like.  It's up to you.  Let me know.  
 
Have a great day.
 
Love, Mom
