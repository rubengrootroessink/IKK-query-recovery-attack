 Turtles Going Home. 
This mother and baby tutle set inspires the most enchanting atmosphere. 

This crystal contains 24% to 30% lead with strict quality control. They
were specifically ordered by oversea distributors which in turn resale
to department stores. Due to the Economic downturn, the distributor went
bankrupt, which also brought down the manufacturer. We were able to pick
up the inventory at pennies on a dollar, on the whole sale level. We
just pass the saving to you. That's why you're seeing rediculus prices
here. 	
Similar item like this sell for more than $95 in retail store, but it
will be yours for $4.95 .
