That is terrible news. Do you know who he was and what role he played? 
 
Eric, if you are contacted by anyone in the news media to discuss with and interview you related to Enron, I strongly recommend that you have no comments to make. I see no upside to you being mentioned in the papers or elsewhere. -L

Just heard on the news that former Enron exec, Cliff Baxter, committed suicide this a.m.  That makes me ill.  LU
