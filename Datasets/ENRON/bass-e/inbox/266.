What a better way to start the new year off than with cheap airfares. We
have been able to keep several of our low cost airfares around the world.
Our new exclusive low fares to Europe for April through May and June
through August departures are flying out the window (at 60 percent off,
why not?), so you'd better act fast for this special. With temperatures
across the Northeast below 40 degrees and all the feet of snow that
Buffalo has, think 85-degree weather from $218 roundtrip to Nassau,
Freeport or Bermuda and $298 roundtrip or less to the Dominican Republic,
Montego Bay, San Juan or Grand Cayman through February 13, 2002. We also
have specials to Asia, Europe, Canada (think skiing) and Central and South
America. We have so many great travel bargains that have been extended; we
don't know where to start. Also, on Wednesday, January 2, 2002, watch our
email for one heck of a three-day sale! Read the stories listed below. Be
