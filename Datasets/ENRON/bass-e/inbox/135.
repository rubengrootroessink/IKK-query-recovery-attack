1) The enforceability of my existing contract with Enron, namely section 16.  What happens to my contract with Enron and will I be forced to repay both my sign on bonus and my retention bonus to Enron?
 
2) Section 1(f) and the last sentence of section 1(c) seem redundant.  Will I get paid the retention bonus absent voluntary termination (i.e. for both with cause and without cause involuntary termination) ?
 
3) Who will be my employer?  And will all stock and stock option grants be in UBS AG stock?
 
4) What happens to the Restricted Stock grant referenced in Section 2 and again in Exhibit I if UBS terminates me with or without cause?  As a follow up,  if the stock is lost then what is the consideration for signing this contract (non - compete)?
 
5) In Section 9(a), the non - compete clause is set up for a 12 month period after my employment begins and continues regardless of termination both voluntarily and involuntarily.  What is to stop UBS from terminating me or anyone else for that matter immediately after signing this agreement?  All they are out is the Retention portion of the contract (since contract is at will).
