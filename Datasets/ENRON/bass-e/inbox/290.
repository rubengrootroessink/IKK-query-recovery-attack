Dear All:

	I would like to invite you to join Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert, Billy Lemmons, and me for lunch on Wednesday, December 19 at 12:30 p.m. in the 50M Dining Room.  You have been selected for this lunch because of your outstanding performance in the Associate / Analyst Program.  This will be an opportunity for us to get to know you, and to visit on an informal basis.  We will discuss current events related to Enron, our Vision for Becoming the World's Leading Company and entertain any questions you might have for us.

	Please R.S.V.P. to Maxine Levingston via e-mail at Maxine.E.Levingston@enron.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@enron.com> or at x33499 by November 19, 2001.  I look forward to seeing you on December 19.

Best regards,
Ken
