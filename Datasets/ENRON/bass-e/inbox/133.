Just returned from seeing "Black Hawk Down." Strongly recommend that you see this fact based movie.
 
It is a moving tribute to the skill, dedication, selflessness, honor and commitment of our military. 
 
Any politician in the position of being able to send our military into battle should also see this movie. Hopefully, our current political leaders realize that the military will follow their orders, to the death; and, accordingly,believe those orders should be given only if the national interest of the U.S.A. is in jeopardy.-L
