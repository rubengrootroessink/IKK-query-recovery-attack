i wouldn't cancel anything until you talk to him first.  he may not be having anything.  I'm just hearing that he might.

he told me that he wasn't sure if he would be in town.  i guess there is no need to have two. so i won't have one then

looks like we need to have a co-ordinated effort because i think val may be having people over too.  i am indifferent as to where the party is held, but would like a consensus.  you guys should probably talk about it.

right now i guess we have 6 - i have not heard back from boone.  val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then.  i didn't have mitch's e-mail so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull.

i guess we could have about 10 people.

what do you think?
