 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/883072/ref=count_mon_av2>Dear Amazon.com Customer,

As someone who's purchased Action & Adventure films, you might like to know that the thrilling new screen adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/883072/ref=count_mon_av3> opens Friday, January 25--and Amazon.com In Theaters has all the showtimes and locations <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKJ5/ref=count_mon_av4> for your area.

The film follows Edmond, an honest, dashing young sailor who plans to marry the beautiful Mercedes, but who finds his life shattered when his best friend, Fernand, has him unjustly imprisoned and steals Mercedes for himself. Consumed by thoughts of vengeance, Edmond finally escapes and through his new persona--the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo--takes revenge on all who wronged him. Alexandre Dumas's classic story of betrayal is beautifully brought to the screen by director Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and stars Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Richard Harris. The film is rated PG-13.
