Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
"Finances" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan
