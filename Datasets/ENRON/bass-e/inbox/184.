Hello!

I apologize for the mass email. How is everyone doing? I hope everyone's family and friends are doing fine. In light of recent events, I thought about all of you. My family is doing fine. Apparently one of my ex-roommates, Indian guy, was apparently beaten for "looking" middle-eastern in San Francisco. Unbelievable. So what's up? School is going quite well for me. I'm enjoying classes. The people here are outgoing, which is somewhat surprising since we're all a bunch of math freaks. Pittsburgh is no Houston, but it's bearable for a year. I am a bit concerned with the job market this year. 

Michael and Sheila, any plans yet? My best friend and his girlfriend are finally getting married this October, after 7 arduous years. You got time, obviously. I had no luck with Gulay. But I think it was unreasonable to expect anything. I enjoyed it, though. Lenine, how are things? Have you seen "The Tao of Steve" yet? How is your brother doing (these days). Eric, ready to join the special-forces? I believe they're looking for people... How is Shanna doing? Are you the head of the Texas desk by now? 

Drop me a line when y'all get a chance. Take care,

-Hector
