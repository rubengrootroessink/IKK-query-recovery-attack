  WHO IS JACK SCHITT??? The lineage is finally revealed. Many people are at=
 a loss for a response when someone says "You don't know Jack Schitt!"  Rea=
d on and you'll be able to handle the situation intelligently. Jack is the =
only son of Awe Schitt and O. Schitt.  Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, =
married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneedeep & Schitt, Inc. Jack Schitt married=
 Noe Schitt and the deeply religious couple begat 6 children: Holie Schitt,=
 Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins, Deap Schitt and Dip=
 Schitt.  Against her parents wishes, Deap Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a hi=
gh school dropout. After 15 years of marriage, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced=
.  Noe Schitt later married a Mr. Sherlock, and out of devotion to her chil=
dren, decided to hyphenate her last name, and became Noe Schitt-Sherlock.  =
Dip Schitt married a woman named Loda Dung, who became Loda Schitt.  The co=
uple produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.  Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt,=
  inseparable throughout childhood subsequently married the Happens brother=
s. The local newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding, which was quit=
e an event. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse.  Bull =
Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world.  He returned from hi=
s travels with  his Italian bride, Piza Schitt. So, NOW if someone says " Y=
ou don't know Jack Schitt", you can beg to differ. You not only know Jack S=
chitt, but the entire Schitt list!
