Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  (posted
soon) for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I
always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Start Brett Favre.   It's that simple.   Antonio Freeman continues to look
good and deserves a start in most leagues.   Bill Schroeder was pretty quiet
last week but don't look for that to last.   Jacksonville ranks # 28 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and this should be a
nice matchup for Favre and Company.


Oakland Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Rich Gannon continues to prove he's one of the better QBs in Football.
With 221 yards and 3 TDs Sunday, he looked totally in control of his
offense.   Of course, it helps when Tim Brown and Jerry Rice are on the
receiving end of your throws.   Both those guys look as good as ever.
Arizona ranks # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks so this is clearly a mismatch.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

That Flutie Magic was fading a little but he looked strong last week with
308 yards and 2 TDs.   TE Freddie Jones and WR Tim Dwight could make it back
this week to pair with Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway.   The Chargers are
getting stronger while the Seahawks were dealt a serious blow Tuesday with
CB Shawn Springs suspended for 4 games due to failing a steroid test.   This
should really open the passing offense.   LaDainian Tomlinson was a huge
factor as well Sunday in the passing game with 13 receptions.   The Seahawks
rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Alex Van Pelt continues to justify my Rob Johnson bashing.   There is no way
Van Pelt should see the bench once Johnson is healthy.   In the "squeaky
wheel gets the grease" department, Eric Moulds complained pretty loudly last
week he wasn't seeing enough passes thrown his way.   Van Pelt obliged and
Moulds delivered in a big way including an incredible one handed circus
catch.   FB Larry Centers is seeing tons of passes as well.   San Francisco
is ranked # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
but their secondary seems to be improving.   For the year, they rank # 20 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Jim Miller's 97 yard performance Sunday against the Viking defense probably
didn't carry many teams to victory.   This Bear team is looking more and
more like the 2000 Ravens to me with an adequate QB, powerful rushing, and
great defense.   If Miller is your guy, you may have to accept these up and
down games.   Marty Booker was a non factor after his great week 10
performance.   Dez White saw twice as many passes thrown his way than did
Booker.   Detroit ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks so that's a positive.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch put up another Couch-like game with 189 yards and 1 TD.   The
ultra reliable Kevin Johnson caught another TD and looks to be an every week
starter.   Quincy Morgan did see more work than usual but KJ is still the
primary guy by a good bit.   The Titans rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs so this might be a good spot for him.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Even with Mike McMahon providing 4th Quarter excitement, Charlie Batch is
still the starter.   For how long is anyone's guess and you'd have to think
there's even a danger that he could be pulled for McMahon if Batch falters.
Good luck if you can figure out anything the Lion management comes up with.
Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice and he's pretty much it.   Cory
Schlesinger is still seeing plenty of passes thrown his way if you're really
ready to reach.   The Bears rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks but they did shut down the Viking's passing attack last
week.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Mark Brunell is still hampered by the Quad injury and is no lock to play
this week.   If he can't go, WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell will be
downgraded.   Much has been made of the Jimmy Smith troubles.   Assuming
Brunell can play, I wouldn't be surprised to see Smith blow up with a
monster game.   Just a hunch.   Green Bay isn't anything special on defense
ranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
They are tougher for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs New England Defense

Vinny Testeverde should be rested but you have to wonder how he'll fare
against Bill Belichick and New England.   Wayne Chrebet and Laveranues Coles
will be aided by the speedy play of Santana Moss.   Moss is almost a whole
year behind the other rookies though so don't look for too much from him.
New England ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks although Belichick has been known to have a few wrinkles up his
sleeve.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Hasselbeck didn't throw any interceptions Sunday.   But he only threw for
162 yards.   That won't get it done in Holmgren's offense.   Darrell Jackson
and Koren Robinson were pretty active but it was RB Shaun Alexander who
carried the receiving load.   I'd look for that to continue as Seattle
sticks with the conservative game plan.   The Chargers rank # 24 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it's not like they're
dominating people.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Elvis Grbac fought back nicely last week with 259 yards and 1 TD / 1
Interception.   The TD was huge as he rallied the team from behind.   I'm
not a Shannon Sharpe fan but you have to give the guy his due - he moaned
and pointed fingers last week but when the game was on the line, he
delivered.   Travis Taylor and Qadry Ismail are decent plays but
inconsistent.   Indy has struggled lately.   They rank # 14 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 24 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs.


Carolina Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Chris Weinke finally scored a TD.   So what if it was rushing the ball.
The Panthers continued to look bad last week.   Weinke threw for 171 yards,
0 TDs and 2 Interceptions.   Wesley Walls was a non factor which is hard to
understand.   WR Muhsin Muhammad missed last week's game and his return for
this week is still in limbo.   The Saints rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
so the matchup isn't awful.   I just have very little faith in the Panthers
right now.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Peyton Manning is clearly pressing as he tries to carry the load of this
team.   He threw 4 Interceptions last week and three looked to be his fault.
On the flip side, he did throw for 370  yards with a TD so it wasn't all
bad.   This Colt team looks like it could be playing catchup from here on
out so you have to like Manning's chances.   He's battled the trouble with
Interceptions this season and I wouldn't be too worried.   Marvin Harrison
and Terrence Wilkins were the primary targets.   After a couple of excellent
games, TE Marcus Pollard now is catching fewer balls than Ken Dilger.   The
Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.


Miami Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Jay Fiedler's up and down season continued last week as he threw for 262
yards and 3 TDs leading the Dolphins back to victory.   We've been hyping
rookie WR Chris Chambers since June and he delivered in a big way with 2 big
TDs.   As we head into week 12, it's pretty clear that many of these
"rookies" aren't really rookies anymore.   Oronde Gadsden was extremely
active as well with 118 yards.   They'll face Denver this week that ranks #
7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Aaron Brooks continues to look solid.   He threw for 307 yards last week
with a TD plus he ran for 65 yards.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson gather
most of the passes while TE Boo Williams is not a bad choice if you need a
TE as he's seeing lots of balls thrown his way.   Carolina ranks # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Although they
rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Kordell Stewart with 254 yards and 2 passing TDs against the Titans?
Believe it.   Plus another TD rushing.   He's looking good and has the one
thing he desperately needed - confidence.   Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress
both looked strong although Ward is the only one I really trust there.   The
OL is banged up but still I like Stewart's chances.   Minnesota ranks # 15
in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and # 18 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Yes, Kurt Warner looked human Monday night.   Even with his "bad" game, he
threw for 291 yards and a TD.   He'll be fine, as will all the Rams.   Torry
Holt was huge and Isaac Bruce was a big part of the offense.   Atlanta ranks
# 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but I'd be
hard pressed to have any of the Rams key players on my bench.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair with 37 pass attempts for 334 yards and 2 TDs.   Plus another
rushing TD.   That's how whacked this season is.   He looked pretty good
doing it too.   WRs Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson with TE Frank Wycheck
handle the receiving.   All are decent options assuming McNair keeps going
to the air so often.   Cleveland ranks # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   However, for the year they rank # 2 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Jake Plummer put up decent numbers last week with 241 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   With Frank Sanders nursing bad hamstrings, it's evident
that WR David Boston is the focus.   And he's been unstoppable.   He had 6
receptions for 121 yards and a TD last week.   The Raiders are ranked # 9 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so this won't be
easy.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Denver Passing Game vs Miami Defense

With Rod Smith hobbled on both ankles now, Brian Griese is looking very
ordinary.   He had 171 yards and 1 TD last week.   Smith has injured his
other ankle.   He clearly was limited last week even though he played
through it.   TEs Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell are probably his next
best targets.   Miami hopes to have cornerback Sam Madison back this week
which would be a huge boost.   The Dolphins are ranked # 13 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they're ranked #
14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Trent Green didn't throw a TD but he did rack up 256 yards and looked as
good as he has all season.   TE Tony Gonzalez was active as always but most
importantly, WR Derrick Alexander seemed to be healthy.   That's huge.
This week, they face a Philadelphia team that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They have 14 sacks over the last 4 games so
they clearly can pressure the passer.   It'll be a great test for Green.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

Chicago has one of the weakest pass defenses in the league yet they shut
down the Viking passing game last week.   You figure it out.   Culpepper,
Moss and Carter are all too valuable to sit as they could go off at any
time.   But they certainly are frustrating.   My friend (and local Vikings
Expert) Bill Davies has a theory that Moss was serving a secret one game
suspension during the Bears game...  On a positive note, TE Byron
Chamberlain looked to be very much involved in the offense again.   This
week, it's a tough matchup with Pittsburgh that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The Steelers are # 2 against
the run so you have to think the Vikings will be throwing.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Donovan McNabb looked awful again throwing for only 92 yards.   It seems to
me he's trying to prove his ability to stay in the pocket at any cost.
He's much better when he's mobile.   James Thrash and Todd Pinkston both
struggled with McNabb.   TE Chad Lewis had several passes thrown his way but
couldn't catch any of them.   Kansas City is improving on Defense ranking #
12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank #
4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Jeff Garcia is a must start in any league.   Same with Terrell Owens.
Owens has a bad foot and ankle but the early word is that he'll play and be
ok.   J.J. Stokes continues to improve.   He scored a TD Sunday.   And TE
Eric Johnson is still very involved in the offense and deserves
consideration in TE leagues.   Buffalo is solid against the pass ranking # 5
in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it won't be a
cakewalk.   Still though, Garcia and Owens are no brainers.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Brad Johnson continues to throw more times for fewer yards than anyone I can
remember.   He had 34 passes for 185 yards Monday night.   As always,
Keyshawn Johnson was the WR of choice.   RBs Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott
each saw 5 receptions as well.   The Bengals are surprisingly tough against
the pass ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   Could this be the week Keyshawn Johnson snares that ever elusive
first TD of the year?...


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Chris Chandler refused to play along last week throwing for just 132 yards
and 0 TDs against a soft Carolina defense.   I think he does it just to
spite me...   FB Bob Christian was the leading receiver.   But they're
winning.   Tony Martin and Shawn Jefferson have to be considered risky.
This week, Atlanta faces a much tougher St. Louis defense so that probably
means Chandler will do well.   The Rams rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   Overall, I wouldn't put much faith in
this Falcon passing game.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Avoid these guys.   Scott Mitchell or Jon Kitna or Akili Smith?   I think
I'll take Boomer Esiason out of the pressbox...   Peter Warrick injured his
shoulder so keep an eye on him.   No Bengal caught more than 3 passes Sunday
which means they're all pretty worthless at this point.   Tampa Bay ranks #
20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks for what it's
worth.


Dallas Passing Game vs Washington Defense

The Ryan Leaf era is over.   Hope you made video tapes.   Quincy Carter is
set to get the start and I have zero faith in him.   That means Joey
Galloway and Rocket Ismail should struggle as well.   With Emmitt Smith
crying to the press, this team is in danger of total implosion.   Oh yeah,
Washington ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.


New England Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Coach Bill Belichick is looking awfully smart starting Tom Brady over Drew
Bledsoe as Brady threw for 4 TDs Sunday.   Clearly, the guy is for real.
Troy Brown is by far his favorite target and the only guy consistent enough
to merit serious consideration in most leagues.   The Jets are tough against
the pass ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.  They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it should be
interesting.   Very tough matchup but Brady has shown me though that he's a
guy you'd do well not to underestimate.   If you've been riding him, I'd
look real hard at keeping him in the lineup.


Washington Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Tony Banks won't remind anyone of Joe Montana but he seems to do just enough
to win.   He only threw for 96 yards Sunday but he made few mistakes.   Rod
Gardner and Michael Westbrook continued to play solid football.   Dallas
ranks #  3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it
doesn't look like a positive matchup.
