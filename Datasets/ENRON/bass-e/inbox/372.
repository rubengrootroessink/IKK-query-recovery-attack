Hey!  Hope you had a good weekend.  I played some golf to get ready for you 
and Bryan.  Amy and I are putting up the tree right now and listening to 
some Christmas music (Neil Diamond rocks).  If you are out in Sugar Land, 
you should stop by Monday night or Tuesday before we play golf.  I don't 
think you've ever seen the house.  It's a good thing Christmas is here.  A 
time of hope.  Something we probably all need around Enron.  Our home number 
is 281-343-8233.  You could even check out the available homes around us.  
Talk to you soon.

Dave
