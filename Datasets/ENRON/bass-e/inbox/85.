After much arguing and deliberation, historians this week have come up with a  phrase to describe the Clinton Era. It will be called: SEX BETWEEN THE BUSHES. 
 
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta announced that Clinton has proven that you can get sex from Aides.  Gennifer Flowers was asked if her relationship with Clinton was anything like Monica Lewinski's. She replied, "Close, but no cigar."  The FBI has coined a technical term for the stains found on Monica's dress: "Presidue."  
Clinton now recruits interns from only four colleges: Moorhead, Oral Roberts, Ball State and Brigham Young.  Did you know that Clinton had asked to change the Democratic emblem from a donkey to a condom? It represents inflation, halts production, and gives you a false sense of security while you are being screwed.  Arkansas is very proud of Bill Clinton. All these women coming forward ,and not one is his sister! 
Finally, Hillary Clinton recently went to a fortuneteller who intoned, "Prepare to become widow. Your husband will soon suffer a violent death!"  Hillary took a deep breath and asked, "Will I be acquitted?"
