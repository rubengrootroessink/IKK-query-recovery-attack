That is great news on the new contract. You did a super job. 
 
Can you tell how drastic the changes will be with the new owner? 
 
Any indication if S might be made an offer to stay on board? 
 
I will send Al's phone number @ the hotel in case you need to visit with him. Love-Dad

I too feel so much more comfortable with the situation now these two esteemed leaders of American public sentiment have decided to charge into the brach of this most valiant crusade.  Thank God we have Jessie and Al.  I am still tring to figure out which person is the more irrelevant of the two.  The circus just adds more rings every day.  
 
By the way, I signed with UBS today.  I ended up getting a little better deal than we talked about.  A 50% increase on the amounts.

I am so happy and relieved to see that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are in town and have joined in the fight to right all the injustices and inequities brought upon you guys by the dastardly power mongers @ Enron. I will sleep better now that I KNOW your interests are being so protected.-Dad   p.s.-sure hope they also look out for the interests of those of us that "invested" in ENE.
