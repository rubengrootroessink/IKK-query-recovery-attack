Hey, I missed your wonderful response on Monday.  Tim filled me in.  I was
on a plane to Notre Dame on Monday when I heard the wonderful news of my
termination.  Oh well, life's a bitch!

No bets for the LSU game, but I feel that LSU should give the Vols. a run
for their money.

Texas finally wised up and gave Major the start...Mack must need to win this
bowl game?

Oh well, have fun at work.  I have to go back to sleep.
