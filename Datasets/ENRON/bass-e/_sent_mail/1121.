Subject: A$M and its "second tier" status



Hate to promote the obvious.  US News & World Reports has their most current 
college rankings out, and, yes, Texas is in the top 50 schools in the 
country.  A$M in the meantime has returned to their fabled "second tier" 
status where all "second tier" schools belong.  I don't really care if Texas 
Monthly prints a huge front page article that says "UT....THE BEST SCHOOL IN 
TEXAS".....Of course Texas Monthly would never do that because IT ISN"T 
NEWS!!!!!!!   Tell us something we don't know!  You will recall that a couple 
of years ago, Texas Monthly reported that a$m was "the best school in Texas", 
relying on US NEWS & WORLD REPORTS rankings.  I guess that was short lived.

Subject: UT/a$m business school and engineering school comparisons



Whoops.  Looks like a$m is STILL ranked considerably lower than Texas in both 
Business and Engineering, in spite of the fact that every agroid will tell 
you differently.
