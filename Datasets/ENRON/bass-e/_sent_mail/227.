Subject: UT & atm flag football

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament.   
I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT.

I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the 
interoffice mail.

Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which 
makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by 
Enron and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last 
year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts.  
Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT.


Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so 
do your part.

Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know 
and I will try to arrange it.  Webb's team is not practicing.

Finally, we're still short 2 guy players.
