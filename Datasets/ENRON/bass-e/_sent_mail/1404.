I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say " well that is what 
you say every year"), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of
Hemphill, TX.  He is rated by Rivals as the #1 lineman prospect in the
country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.
