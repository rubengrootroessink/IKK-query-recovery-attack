Hey guys!  Christen and I are going to have a cookout/pool gathering Saturday 
around 4 or so.  Consider yourselves invited.  We will have food and 
margueritas.  Christen is buying some beer- but I don't know what type.  So- 
if you have your own little preference- you might want to bring it.  Just let 
me know by Friday- so we can kind of plan numbers.

Shanna
