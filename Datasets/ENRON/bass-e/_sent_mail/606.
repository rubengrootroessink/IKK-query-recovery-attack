i am going to get x-rays on friday or saturday, so you can stop worrying.  
things are sucking right now on the market, so i can't say that i am enjoying 
my job, but i am looking forward to the fantasy football draft on sunday.  
shann started her new job today. she is a little stressed about the increase 
in workload.  she is going to visit the family this weekend, so i have a 
weekend on my own.  

maybe i can come out this weekend to visit ( if you can fit me in).  i had a 
great time last saturday.

how are things in your world?
