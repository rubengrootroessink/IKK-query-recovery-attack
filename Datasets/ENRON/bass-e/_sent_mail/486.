I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.
