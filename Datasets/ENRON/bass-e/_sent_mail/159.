Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

Eric
