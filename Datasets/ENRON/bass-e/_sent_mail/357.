I received this email and wanted to share the photo.

Beautiful but sad.

This awsome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska  by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he
was working  while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it
so he  should  at  least be recognized as the photographer of this once
in a lifetime shot.
