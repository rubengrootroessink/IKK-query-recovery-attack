Hello Everyone,

I hope that you all enjoyed the holidays, and I'd venture to say that most of 
you enjoyed it more than I did.  I did however have a great New Years.  It 
actually inspired this email.  On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New 
Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't 
gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.  We were 
thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.  It's located at 
6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-6700).  Also, I think we are going to do 
Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.  Please let me 
know if you plan on attending.  I think we are going to head over there 
between 6:30 - 7:00.

Hope to see you all tonight!!

LISA
