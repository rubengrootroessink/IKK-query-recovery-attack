I want to drop Terry Kirby and Adrian Murrell.  How do I add Jerome Bettis to 
my starting line-up and drop Jamal Lewis to a reserve?

Please e-mail me who you want to add and drop.  

Check you roster to make sure that it is legal.


I still need your dues by Sunday or you forfeit.

I have only received dues from Dave and Steve!
