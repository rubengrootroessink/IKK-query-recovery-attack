I am going to play with Taylor one week.  I have been waiting this long.  I
know I am blowing a real good deal, but I will come to you next week, after
I see what he can do.

have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early
today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!

Let me know

That sounds viable.  Give me a little time to mull it over.  I commend you
decent offer :)

walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that
is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he
does.

now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either
watters, anderson or george?

I need to know fairly quickly

I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
Watters thus far this season.

Eric,

Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson
