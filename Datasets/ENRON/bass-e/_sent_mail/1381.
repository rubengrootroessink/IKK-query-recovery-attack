I made a few changes.  Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better 
(preferably fitting on one page).  So most of my changes have been 
consolidations.  Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet 
points the same (you want to do this on all resumes and outlines).

As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner on 
Friday at Pappasitos.  Can you make it?

-Eric
