I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.  I don't think you can make a 
case that you were smart for betting me without the points.  That's like me 
saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am 
confident that it is going to 90.

That's real smart.  No wonder EES loses money!

Going below the belt?  If that makes you feel better, because you were wrong 
about your team and conference AGAIN, so be it.  There are still seats 
available on the bandwagon.  The fee is only $50.  How smart you were to bet 
me without giving any points - definitely worth bragging about.
