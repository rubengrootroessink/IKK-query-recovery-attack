Subject: Re: Friday State of the Union  

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it "landry loaded"?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union
