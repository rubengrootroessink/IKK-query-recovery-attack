Michael is working at CSR.  I do not know what that is, but at least he is 
working.  He is living in that neighborhood behind Haverty's.  I do not know 
who he is living with.  He is not dating anyone.  Michael Smith is engaged.  
I think they are getting married either this summer or next summer.  I can't 
remember.
I need your help.  When I get married in June we are going to leave out of 
Houston and fly to Cancun.  But, I need a nice hotel to stay in the night of 
the wedding in Houston.  I need suggestions, phone number, etc.  Also, I want 
a limo to take me from the reception in Conroe to the Hotel in Houston.  I 
need suggestions and phone numbers for that also if you do not mind.  Thanks 
Shanna Lynn.
