Hey Mom,

Don't Worry about Friday, we ended up going out to eat with Michael and 
Sheila.  Any more news on the watch and $?

I don't think that I am interested in the Grace luncheon, thanks though. 

I am going to Austin this weekend but will be back on Saturday.  Shanna is 
going to Louisiana, so this weekend will be good for the clothes.  Do you 
need a check from Shanna for the airfare?  If so, let me know.

What did you do this weekend?

-Eric

Hi Eric,
?
How was your weekend?? Sorry again about  Friday night.? 
?
Someone from Grace Pres. Church called to extend an  invitation to you and 
Jason for a "singles" luncheon after the 11 o'clock  service on Sunday.? If 
you are interested, call 713-267-5075 for  reservations.? Just thought I'd 
pass that along.
?
I hope we can see you this weekend.? Are you  going to Austin?? We have 
plenty of time to look at the clothes.? She  ought to have a couple of weeks, 
though, if she doesn't like what I  have.
?
Talk to you later.? Have a great day.?  LU-M
