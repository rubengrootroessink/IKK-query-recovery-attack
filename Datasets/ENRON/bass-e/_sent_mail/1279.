Hey Shanna -

How was your weekend in Louisiana?  Did you and Eric have fun?  I'm emailing
because last weekend I was really sick and had to cancel dinner and dancing.
I went to the doctor and found out I had pneumonia.  I rescheduled dinner
for this Friday, so if you and Eric are free, I would love for the two of
you to come.  Dinner is at Lupe Tortilla at 8:30.  We'll probably go dancing
afterwards!

Let me know if you guys can come.

Take care -
