So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and 
Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe 
Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a 
ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better 
way).  

Let me know
