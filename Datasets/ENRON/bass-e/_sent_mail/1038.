June-August were incorrect in Sitara.  I have made the necessary 
adjustments.  Stephanie will have to reissue payments.  By my calculations, 
Cabot owes HPL $16,050.

6/99    5000     $2.09      $2.20      $ (16,500)     This Should be Sharp's 
expense as this was pre-merger.
7/99    5000     $2.14      $2.20      $ (9,300)        This Should be the

Eric, 

Why would this ticket only affect Sept. and not the other months?

I am only showing a price adjustment for 9/99.  No adjustments for June- 
August occurred.

Stephanie, 

The deal ticket that Eric mentions below that changed the tiered pricing is 
EW5406.1 (which fixes the price to $2.35 from 6/1/99-9/30/99).

I was wondering if you showed price adjustments to June-August, in addition 
to September (since this ticket affects all months). 

Let me know, and then I'll call Laurie Clarkson with Cabot Oil & Gas and ask 
her to run this past her trader (Kent Beard) and make sure we are all on the 
same page.

Thanks, 
Melissa

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,
Melissa

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Original payment ( per your email below )
