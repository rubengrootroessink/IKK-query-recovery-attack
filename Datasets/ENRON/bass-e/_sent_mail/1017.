i had a really fun weekend.  we went to chuy's and gallant knight on friday, 
a work party and black swan on saturday, and had the super bowl party on 
sunday.  

about 20-25 people showed up to the party, so it was a fairly big success.  
of course, you didn't show up so it wasn't as successful as it could have 
been.

how was yours?
