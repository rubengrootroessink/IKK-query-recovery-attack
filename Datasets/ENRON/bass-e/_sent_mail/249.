To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,


Eric Bass
