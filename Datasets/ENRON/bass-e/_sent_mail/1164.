What did I tell you??  That's good though- I'll get to see you.  I need to go 
to the grocery- but I left my list at home.  Guess I'll go tomorrow.  And 
I'll cook Thursday and Saturday night.  How does that sound?

 I hate to say this, but maybe its best if we reschedule.  it doesnt sound 
like we are all going to be able to make it by 6 and i would rather not be 
rushed considering we see each other once every 6 months.

let me know what you girls think.  maybe we should try a weekend lunch?
