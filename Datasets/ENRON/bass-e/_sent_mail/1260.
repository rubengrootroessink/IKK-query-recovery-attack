Good deal.  I think you'll like Bob but, like Dad said, don't feel
obligated.  Don't forget to put the contracts in a folder/envelope and bring
them along.  How many copies did you make?  I'll call the realtors and see
about tomorrow.  Did you want to see 400 W. Alabama again?  It's usually
open on Sunday. LU-M
