Can you help me out here?  I don't have the details in the attached E-mail.  
So I need to understand what the product is so that we can determine the 
"back office" issues.  Apparently, time frame is short.  So I appreciate the 
info ASAP.  Thanks.

Brenda, can you get someone to work through the issues the back office may 
have.  I would like to get this product up and running before the end of 
April.  EDG

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.
