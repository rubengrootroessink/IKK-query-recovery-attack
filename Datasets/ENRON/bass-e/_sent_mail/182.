Subject: Practice - TONIGHT


Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.
