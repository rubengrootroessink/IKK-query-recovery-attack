in order to counter offer, you must have had an offer.  if you remember,
you offered me a lesser trade than that already


my counter offer is 4,7,10 for your 2, 8

Eric,

I have done some investigating and here is the counter offer I am willing
to
do.

I will trade you my 2 and 14 for you 3 and 5.  Let me know what you want to
do.

Ramiro would like to trade you his 13 for your 15 and 16.

I am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order.  Some, have
said
that it is not fair for Steve to be handed the 6th slot.  Let me know what
you
think.
