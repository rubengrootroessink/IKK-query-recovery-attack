Hey Paul,

I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag 
Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney 
starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game 
(2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,

Eric

Hope all is well.  Is this in reference to the Enron/Andersen Consulting 
football game?  When is it?  Do you need me to play?  Give me a call and we 
can discuss (3-9557).  

Thanks,

Paul

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!
-Eric
