You will get reimbursed once you have taken the exam.  After you have done 
that you may use the education assistance form and turn it in to Randy Martin 
for reimbursement.  This can only be done after the exam has been taken.

Thanks!

Dolores,

I have signed up for the CFA exam in June.  Who do I need to talk to to get a 
reimbursement?


Thanks,

Eric
