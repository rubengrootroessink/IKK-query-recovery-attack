I was sick on Sunday, so that wasn't very fun.  I saw the last few minutes
of the game, or the whole game for that matter.  I couldn't reply to your
evite because it was sent wrong......... sorry.  So, are you still planning
on making an appearance on Sunday?  Don't worry, I won't know half of the
people either!:-)  how's everything else?
