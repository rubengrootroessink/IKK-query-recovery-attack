Hey Gillette,

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  

Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to supply you with some of the guidelines.

Subject:	Power Generation Question

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e.	Coal		4 mmbtu = 1 MW
	Simple Cycle	11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa
