Hey Aunt Bonnie,

I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.

Love,

Eric

Hi Eric,

I really enjoyed my visit to Texas.  It was great
seeing you and meeting Shanna.  You have grown into a
fine young man and I'm proud of you.  I hope to see
you again maybe next year. Keep in touch.

Love   Aunt Bonnie
