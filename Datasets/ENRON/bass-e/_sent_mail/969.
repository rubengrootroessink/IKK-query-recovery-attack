Don't get testy. I wasn't trying to get you upset.  I thought we were having 
a normal conversation.  It just didn't seem like you were talking as much as 
usual.

Read too much into you???  How can I read too much into you when I don't know 
how to read you at all.  Half the time when you say something- I have no idea 
what you are really trying to say.

I'm fine. I think you read too much into me. 
Besides, I'm just trying to find the best way to deal with your attitude!

Bright, articulate, attractive, charming, reserved but, most of all, she
admires and respects someone I love.  What a gal!  I'm glad you work for a
"for profit" company!  Enjoyed the evening.  LU-M
