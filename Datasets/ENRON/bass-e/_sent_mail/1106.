Can you invalidate these deals so I can change the counterparty? 

Thanks,

Eric

Ami,
 
 Could you confirm with Janet if the two deals mentioned above should be 
Reliant Energy - Entex or Entex Gas Marketing?  Entex called & advised they 
show it to be a sell to Entex Gas Marketing & that's the way I see it as 
well.  Just let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle
