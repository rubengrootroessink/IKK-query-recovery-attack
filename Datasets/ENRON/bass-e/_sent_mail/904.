Sorry about the headache.  I hear that slamming your head against the wall is 
good for getting rid of migraines.  Oh wait that's what I do at work to help 
me think about something other than losing lots of money - never mind.

Thurs is probably best then - if not then maybe next week.

My weekend was ok.  Sorry if I stopped by at a bad time on Thursday!  I've
had a migraine for the last two days, and it still hasn't gone away, so I'm
not feeling 100% today.  I won't be able to get together until after
Wednesday or so, if that is all right, I have so much going on in  school
this week.  Keep in touch and let me know what day is good for you!

-Dee
