I don't think 5:15 is a great time for us, but don't let us keep you from 
going to the show.  If you want to go to the early show, we won't be 
offended.  We can do something another time.  We would love to do something 
with you if you decide against the 5:15 show.

Hi guy. Ain't Misbehaving is the entertainment at  the Great Caruso. They 
have 2 shows, 5:15 or 8:45. No room at the inn for the  8:45 show, and we 
figured 5 was a little early for you guys. Any  thoughts?-Dad
