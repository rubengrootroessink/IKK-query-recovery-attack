The following are the possible dates (that fit into our schedule as far as I 
know) that we could go see The Nutcracker.  Take a look and see what you 
think.

Dec.  16(Sat),  17(Sun), 19(Tues) 20(Wed) OR

we could go after Christmas (but I am thinking that is just not as fun):

Dec 28 (thurs), 29 (Fri), 30(Sat)
