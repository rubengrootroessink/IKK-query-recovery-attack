Apparently the doctor says it's ok... I bet she said that she was better, but 
not "hey, it's ok
to go out, drink and dance in a room full of smoke and people."

I went to the doctor yesterday and she said I'm much better.  Trust me, I
haven't been out in an entire month, I am SO ready to do some drinking and
dancing!
Thanks for emailing Brian.
