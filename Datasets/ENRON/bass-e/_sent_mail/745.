I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in 
Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming 
on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.  
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.  
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., 
natural gas, coal, etc.)

Do you have this information?

Thanks,

Eric
