Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa
