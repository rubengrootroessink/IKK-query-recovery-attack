Subject: My Complaint letter to America West


I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the
complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed
the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed
our connection we were forced to spend a combined
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Final Itinerary (after all changes) -
Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM
Flt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM

Flt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM
Flt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM

Sincerely,

Eric Bass
