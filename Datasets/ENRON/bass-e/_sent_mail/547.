my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no
