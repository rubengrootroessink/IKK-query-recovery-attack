I wanted to take a minute to apologize to you guys for the scene at last 
night's game.  I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and 
I am sorry.  That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a 
team in the next session.  We had previously committed to play, but with 
recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.  Please 
let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because 
I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.  If we decide not 
to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit 
deposit).  It is critical that I get a 100% response to this email to gauge 
whether or not we have enough people.  Due to the increased number of the 
people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible 
due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).  The 
season begins next wednesday.

Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at 
least the fun part).  Have a good weekend.
PL
