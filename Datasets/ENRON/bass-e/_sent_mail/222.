Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

I never heard anything back from Walker's Westies so The Rounders are taking 
his spot.
