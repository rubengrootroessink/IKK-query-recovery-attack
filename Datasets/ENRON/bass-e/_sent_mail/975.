Hey Bass, 
Got to ask a favor of u...

If u have a chance sometime in the near future could u do an hr session of 
intro to risk 101?
I would feel comfortable looking like an idiot asking u questions.  I could 
use just a 
sliver of your knowledge on the subject to understand things a little better 
over here.

Let me know, if not Jay can dedicate some time to it in a couple weeks.  
Thanks.
