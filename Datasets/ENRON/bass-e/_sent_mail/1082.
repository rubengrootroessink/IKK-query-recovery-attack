we had a great time at the swan.  we went to eat with about 15 people from 
enron and made our way to the swan at around 11:30.  it sounds like you had a 
pretty laid back saturday, that's good to have occassionaly.  

I have you jacket in my car, so let me know what you want to do about that. 

talk to you later,

   how was black swan?  i was suppose to also meet todd and crusher there, but
   we went to our friend's new house and ended up coming back to our house,
   making pizza, cookies, playing sega and watching home videos.  is that
   outrageous or what?
