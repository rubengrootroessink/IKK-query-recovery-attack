Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.
