Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000

Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

"If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else."

Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00
Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad
Johnson struggled against Dallas. The rifle-armed QB may put a jolt into the
Washington offense if he indeed gets a chance to start.

:)

Please forward to the owner of Brad Johnson.
