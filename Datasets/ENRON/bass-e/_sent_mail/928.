Subject: Our country's 28th President

For those of you who aren't history buffs, the individual in question would 
be Woodrow Wilson.  Now, if you all are the reasonably intelligent 
individuals I believe you to be you will have already guessed where I'm going 
with this...  Anyway, given the impending heat wave that will soon be 
striking our fair city, it is my recommendation that we take this opportunity 
to enjoy one more pleasant evening on Woody's deck.  Same Bat time, same Bat 
channel (9:30-10:00).
