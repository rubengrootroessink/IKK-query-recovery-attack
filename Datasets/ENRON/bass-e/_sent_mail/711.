Michael,

Wednesday afternoon after 3:00 would be good for me.  Let me know if this 
works for you.

Subject: Analyst PRC Review

Eric,

Let me introduce myself.  I am currently Director of Tax for the Enron India 
business unit and have been with Enron in various Tax functions for 
approximately 5 years.  I have been asked to sit on the Enron Corp. 
Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of  18 
Analysts, including you.  Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented 
to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.  

I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.  To 
that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-Enron background and 
what you have accomplished while at Enron, in particular during the 6/2000 
review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your "goals").  
With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments 
during the 19-July PRC presentation.  

Here's what I need -

resume (most recent is fine,  even if out of date)
name of your "PRC Supervisor" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 
Feedback)
location and phone extension
your goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would 
appreciate your doing so)
accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your 
stated goals)
outside activities which support the community, especially those where your 
represent "Enron" (e.g., charitable endeavors)
other activities you are involved in which support "Enron" as a whole (e.g., 
college recruiting)

One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.  I would 
like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next 
week.  Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (11/12-July) for 
30 minutes?  We could use that time to run through your background materials.

Please furnish the name of your "PRC Supervisor" by email ( my list indicates 
it is Tom Martin ) so that  I can contact them for a copy of the business 
unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.

Thanks for your help ... I look forward to meeting you !
