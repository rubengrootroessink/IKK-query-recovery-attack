I am not a market maker in SWA vouchers, so you have my word that I will not 
sell them back.  Your bid for these vouchers is $250 in the market, my bid 
for bulk is $200,  I am willing to pay more.  I can already get to my 
destination for $250 - so maybe we can meet in the middle.

Let me know

If you get me for $200--you can sell em to me for $250.
I have no offer for you.
Thanks

Well I am looking for 24 Round trip tickets (48 one-ways)  and was looking
to spend around $200 per round trip ($100 for each one-way).  What is your
offer on that size?

Thanks for you PROMPT attention because I am trying to book airfare today
on one airline or another.

Let's put it like this: How many do you want and at what price are you
willing to pay?

How many 1 way tickets do you have?  I am interested in buying in bulk!

Thanks,
