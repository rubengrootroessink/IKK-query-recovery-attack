Hey!  Did we ever come up with our plans for the week/weekend?  I know that 
you said you were busy Wednesday and Thursday night- so I figured you and I 
would do something Friday night.  Michelle (one of the girls that I work 
with) asked if I wanted to go with her to a crawfish boil Saturday late 
afternoon- but I got the idea that it wasn't a bring a date type thing.  I 
haven't eaten crawfish in an age- so sounded like fun- I know that we don't 
usually so stuff during the day on the weekends- but I wanted to make sure 
that you didn't have anything planned for us to do that afternoon before I 
told her one way or the other.  But- even if I went to the boil- I would be 
back in time to go out later that night.  

Just let me know what you think.  Oh- and I guess since you can't see me 
Wednesday or Thursday- that probably means that you want to see me tonight. 
:-)

Shanna
