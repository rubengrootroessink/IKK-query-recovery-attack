Hey Sheila,

Happy Birthday! Shanna and I are going to Louisiana on Friday, so we can't 
make it.  I hope you have fun.

Subject: My Birthday


Hello everyone -

This Friday some of my friends and I (and Michael of course) are getting
together to celebrate my birthday.  We're starting with dinner at Lupe
Tortilla at 8:30 pm and then most likely going to the Mercury Room.  We
might go to a few other places depending on who wants to do what.  I'm
pretty leniant as long as I get to dance!

I hope you all can make it.
