Have you ever summarized the conversation you had with Jim Schweiger last 
week re: cost to blow-up Entex deal?  I believe Tom is back today, and I 
would anticipate his request for our analysis.  Please let me know - I am in 
meetings all day back-to-back.  Please call on my cell phone - 713-471-2995.  
Thanks.
