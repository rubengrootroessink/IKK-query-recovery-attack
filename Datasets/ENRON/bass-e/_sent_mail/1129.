Eric, I have reviewed the users that have access similar to yours and want to 
confirm if they are in the Risk Management group for Texas/HPLC.  Please let 
me know which users are not in your group and also add people in your group 
that I have not listed.

In addition, I noticed that some users have a Risk Management role while 
others have a Trader role.  The ONLY difference between those two roles is 
that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.  If no one 
is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can 
change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.  It makes it a lot 
easier when I am trying to categorize users.  You still have access to Deal 
Ticker, Deal Manager (read/edit) and Position Manager under the Risk 
Management role.  Thank you for your time in advance and for your quick 
responses.  I understand that you are busy so please take your time in 
getting back with the requested information.
