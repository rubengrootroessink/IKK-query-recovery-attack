I guess that feeling is similar to the one you get whenever you are around 
me.  You just don't know what to say.

I guess last  time you were just nervous- with me being there and all.  I'm 
sorry that I make you a little nervous- although it is quite understandable 
that you would feel that way.

we won both games, of course.  i was 3-6 with a double off the fence - and 
you missed it!  One guy on our team hit a home run in back-back at bats.

you get a chance.
