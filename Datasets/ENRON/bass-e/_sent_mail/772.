			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.
