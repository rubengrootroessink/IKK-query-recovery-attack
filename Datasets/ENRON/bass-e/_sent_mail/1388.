Well I am looking for 24 Round trip tickets (48 one-ways)  and was looking to 
spend around $200 per round trip ($100 for each one-way).  What is your offer 
on that size?  

Thanks for you PROMPT attention because I am trying to book airfare today on 
one airline or another.

Let's put it like this: How many do you want and at what price are you
willing to pay?

How many 1 way tickets do you have?  I am interested in buying in bulk!

Thanks,
