 >Good one!
 >
 >>A Longhorn fan used to amuse himself by scaring
 >>every A & M fan he would
 >>see strutting down the side of the road in their
 >>obnoxious burgandy and white
 >>colors.
 >>
 >>He would swerve his van as if to hit them, and
 >>then he would swerve back
 >>on the road just before hitting them.
 >>
 >>One day, as the van driver was driving along, he
 >>saw a priest. He thought
 >>he would do a good deed and pulled the van over.
 >>He asked the priest,
 >>"Where are you going, Father?"
 >>
 >>"I'm going to give Mass at St. Patrick's Church,
 >>about five miles down the road," replied the priest.
 >>
 >>"No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb
 >>in!"  The priest climbed
 >>into the passenger seat, and the van continued
 >>down the road.
 >>
 >>Suddenly, the driver saw a A & M fan strutting
 >>down the road, and
 >>instinctively, he swerved as if to hit him. But,
 >>as usual, just in time,
 >>he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the guy.
 >>
 >>Even though he was certain he missed the guy, he
 >>still heard a loud
 >>"THUD." Not understanding where the noise came
 >>from,  he glanced in his mirrors,
 >>but he didn't see anything.
 >>
 >>He then remembered the priest, and he turned  to
 >>the priest and said, "I'm
 >>sorry, Father. I almost hit that Aggie fan."
 >>
 >>"That's OK," replied the priest. "I got
 >>  him with the door."
 >>
 >>FOOTBALL SEASON'S HERE!  AND SO IT BEGINS.........
 >>GO LONGHORNS!
