alone.

    2.The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a
leaky tire.

    3.It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal the
neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.

payments.

    12.If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.

    13.If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again;it was
probably worth it.

    14.Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach him how to fish,
and he will sit in a  boat and drink beer all day.

    15.If you drink, don't park. Accidents cause people.

    16.Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.

    17.Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.

    18.If at first you don't succeed,  skydiving is not for you.

    19.Don't squat with your spurs on.

    20.Good judgment comes from bad experience and a lot of that comes from
bad judgment.

back  in your pocket.

    26.There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.

    27.Never miss a good chance to shut up.

    28.Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is moving.

    29.Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.
That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their
shoes.

    30.Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.

    31.Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced,  you can't be
promoted.
