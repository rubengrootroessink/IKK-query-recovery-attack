Addendum No. 1

To whom it may concern:

It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are
interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this
weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to
previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January
20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the
whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs
are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it
would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much
out there.

If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can
decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!

Thank you,

George Kissamis
