Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this 
and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?

Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior 
to the draft.  I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan 
and trade your picks.

Let me know.

Eric
