Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

Jamie Hogan
