My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't 
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be 
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you 
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in 
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know
