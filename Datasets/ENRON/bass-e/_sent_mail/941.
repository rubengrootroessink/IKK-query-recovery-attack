Ok- I'm getting pissed off.  I came in today to work on a project- only to 
find out that my tax application is not set up to do what I need to do.  So- 
basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can 
come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that 
could take a day or two.  See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that 
I have worked with at Enron- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.  No one is a planner.  
Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I 
wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- 
especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is  THEIR Friday 
off!  

I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application 
is fixed or not.  The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- 
she isn't coming in.  See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat 
their rotators like interms around here.  That is basically what is pissing 
me off.  You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.  You are 
totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last 
night- that this needed to be done.  No respect and poor planning.  Very 
dangerous combination.  And I'm tired of it .  It is quickly approaching the 
time to find a new profession.  

OK- enough venting for this morning.  Sorry- I am sure I will be in a much 
better mood when I see you tonight
