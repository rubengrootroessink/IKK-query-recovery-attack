Subject: Performance Data

Good Morning!

I wanted to let each of you know that I had no problem collecting sufficient 
performance data to present you to the Corporate PRC on Wednesday.  After the 
meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.
