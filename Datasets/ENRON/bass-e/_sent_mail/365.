touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 
15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good 
all year.
My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.

Let me know

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My "Shitty"
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.

alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone
player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you
can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring
back in the league) will still be there.

him?
