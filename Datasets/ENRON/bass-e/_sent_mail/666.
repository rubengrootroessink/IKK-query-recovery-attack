Just wanted to remind you guys of the get together this weekend for the Texas 
guys at my house.  Please let me know by Friday if you will be able to come 
and I will draw up some maps.  I was thinking about 5 p.m. to get started.   
Beer and burgers will be on the menu with a little bit of billards action.  
Please bring your significant others(Mick, please only bring one).  
PL
