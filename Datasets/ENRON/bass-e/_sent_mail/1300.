Hi Eric,
?
I called the agent.? He's out of town.? I  left a message on his voicemail?to 
ask someone else in his office to show  it to us.? I'll let you know when I 
hear something.? I have to start  with the listing agent.? Otherwise, the 
commission lines get blurred.?  Talk to you later.? Have a nice day. LU-M
