you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about 
the EES bullshit.  if it bothers you that much then say something about it.  
as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.  i know 
that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if 
invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.  i was just 
trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's 
lead.  and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought 
up the cfa.  i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that 
is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a 
test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.  

so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat.

Look man, you started this shit by bringing up the same cheap EES comments 
that you always do when you have nothing better to say.  When I have to put 
up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below 
the belt.  I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason 
you always add the bit about EES.  Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing 
between you and Heidi in my face.  That doesn't add much credibility.

Between friends,  life and work are not constant competitions to see who's 
smarter or who makes more money.  I was genuinely happy for you when you 
decided to stay on at the desk.  As a matter of fact, I remember giving you 
advice, as a friend, on that very subject.  I hold no resentment or jealousy 
that you got it and I didn't.  I wouldn't have taken it anyway.  I neither 
liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.  But, I did it 
well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.  
My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.  It was a risk that paid 
off very well.  Of course you are better at what you do than I.  But I 
seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or 
managing a project.  It's all about what you do well and being happy with 
that.  I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less 
important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA 
arrogant bullshit.

....And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks 
(i.e. Indian Princess.)  At least I don't take them on dates (that was 
justified.)  Now let's cut this crap and move on. 

Or I'll send my Dad to beat up your Dad.

Out.

I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.  I would hate to have to come 
to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.  I guess I just had this 
opportunity fall in my lap because I never have added the kind of value that 
you did while in risk or EES.  I guess that is why I got offered a promotion 
to stay and you were sent packing to Enron Siberia.

P.S. Shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend, maybe you 
can hook up!

Hack it?  Not too tough to be a "yes" man and claim someone else's profits as 
your own.  Besides, I hope you can handle the pressure of the trading floor a 
bit better than pressure of the CFA.  Food poisoning?  C'mon.  

P.S.  I hear Tom's on vacation soon.  You'd better flatten out.

It may not be rocket science, but not everyone can hack it.  Isn't that why 
you left the wholesale side of the business?  Besides somebody has to take up 
the slack for EES.  Let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your 
loss for the quarter, I'm sure I can spare some out of my book!

Remember, buys are 1/2 cent above Tom's buys and sells are 1/2 cent below.  
Keep up the hard work.  It's definitely rocket science.

I don't need to talk shit about the game.  I will let the Longhorns do the 
talking for me on Saturday.

By the way,  you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now.

Excerpt from Baseball America on 2000 CWS.

Bass, give it up.  You are done.

The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                    nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
Southeastern
                    Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
have power
                    hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
better than recent
                    versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
arms, and they have
                    Bertman around to use them.
