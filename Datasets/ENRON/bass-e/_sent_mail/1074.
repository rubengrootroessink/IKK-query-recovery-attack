Eric,
Let me know if you're the one that would initiate a pub code for pricing 
requested by Kris Hanson in settlements.  She is looking for a pub code that 
represents Gas Daily Henry Hub average of the three days of flow(common high) 
+ 2 days.  I have included a spreadsheet of what she would like to see. 
Thanks,

Judy
