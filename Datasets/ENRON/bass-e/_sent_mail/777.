Yes- I realize that I typed it wrong after the fact- thanks.  Got my whole 
little credit card situation taken care of- they cancelled the whole account 
and are sending me a new card- not that you care.  Let me know around 5- when 
you are ready to leave for the little happy hour- and we can walk over 
together.  And- I put you last on purpose- just b/c I know it irritates you.  
:-)
