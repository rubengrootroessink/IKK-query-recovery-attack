John Cote asked me to forward this information on to any guys that I thought 
might be interested.  Apparently, he thinks I know a lot of noble men here at 
Enron.  All kidding aside, this sounds like a worthwhile thing, if you have 
the time.  If any of you are interested, contact John Cote at ext. 3-3830.

Hope everyone has a great 4th of July!
Thanks,
Christa
