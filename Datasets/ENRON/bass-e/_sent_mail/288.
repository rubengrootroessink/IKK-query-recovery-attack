the Buffaloes will be trying to do this week. Colorado has won six straight=

M:=20
"The play of our offensive line was the most dominant we've had. I felt lik=

the line and all the kids really cut it loose for the first time this seaso=
n.=20
We were a much more focused team."=20
=09
=09On Texas: "Texas is the most talented team we'll face this year, maybe i=
n a=20
couple years. They are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball, and th=
ey=20
have depth. You've got to think after their loss (to Oklahoma), they will=
=20

challenge for us is to hold up defensively against their passing game."=20
=09
=09On Mack Brown: "What I've been most impressed with Mack is his ability t=

players. He's forced the hand of a lot of players and gotten commitments=20
early. They have been able to hand-pick the players they want out of Texas.=
=20
When you can get Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the same=20
class, something is going on. Something good. We recruited all of those=20
players. The hype around Simms had something to do with it, too. Receivers=

want to play with a good quarterback."=20

=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09Q:What's the deal with the QB rotation this week? And were there any oth=
er=20
promotions to the starting lineup?=20
=09?? Marge Ringer=20
=09
=09BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on=
=20
Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a=
=20
"need-to-win" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is =
no=20
plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the=
=20
offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive=
=20
coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20
rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20
promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R=
oy=20
Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad=
e=20
these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take=
=20
more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock=
=20
Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see=
=20
more carries than the two he had against OU last week.=20

=09Kenny Hayter=20
=09
=09Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b=
igger=20
running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20
third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow=
n=20
back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a=
=20
guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on=
=20
first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20
well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20
long  situations due to not
=09
=09picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,=
 is a=20
more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther=
e=20
on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20
Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an=
d=20
is a reliable blocker. =20
=09?? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20
=09
=09BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game=
=20
became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th=
e=20
second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h=
e=20
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw=
=20
and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi=
s=20
week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20
=09?? Lance Kyles=20
=09
=09BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed =
to=20
bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne=
xt=20
year's OU game.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get=
=20
pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?=
=20
Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?=
=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=
g=20
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa=
s=20
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot =
of=20
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=
e=20
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=
=20
week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=
,=20
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=
rs=20
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20
defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like=
=20
running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi=
g=20
yards.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in  1995, and=
 no=20
one was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds  turned on Jo=
hn=20
Mackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 1997. Not only was I appall=
ed=20
at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for=
=20
the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20
embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are=
=20
about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20
=09?? Lisa Davis, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around=
=20
Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20
coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond=
=20
after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi=
s=20
game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,=
=20
the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart =
in=20
order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real=
ly=20
in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20
chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta=
te=20
and at Texas A=02?are slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge wi=
th at=20
least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with =
a=20
win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhi=
te=20
at QB, then everyone will say "I told you so, Mack" regarding the QB rotati=
on=20
having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also=
=20
embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but=
=20
they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for=
=20
the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.=
=20
He'll be around Texas for a good while.=20

=09Casey Hampton=20
=09
=09Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any =
idea =20
what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that =
=20
after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numero=
us=20
times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistenc=
y,=20
and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to=
=20
follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are=20
embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to scr=
ew=20
up horribly in random=20
=09
=09games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like=
 the=20
players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the=
=20
solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend i=
n=20
a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient=
=20
Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't=
=20
work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffl=
e=20
me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to=
=20
fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developi=
ng=20
a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then=
=20
the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the go=
od=20
but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.=
=20
=09?? David Rowe, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma =
got=20
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t=
o=20
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc=
he=20
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=
.=20
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=
=20
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=
he=20
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=
o=20
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=
ut=20
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=
er=20
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=
=20
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=
=20
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=
an=20
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=
=20
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =
have=20
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=
=20
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=
=20
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=
me=20
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=
=20
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=
ke=20
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=
=20
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=
he=20
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=
=20
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20
tendencies also?=20
=09?? Todd Purl=20
=09
=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =
his=20
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=
as=20
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=
t=20
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=
=20
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=
=20
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=
ng=20
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=
e=20
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=
=20
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=
=20
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- =
be=20
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
=20
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
=20
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
nd=20
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
Or=20
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
=20
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
=09?? Mike Engelman=20
=09
=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
ing.=20
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
er=20
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
=20
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
exas=20
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
=20
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
=20
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
ng=20
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
e=20
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
e=20
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
e=20
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
=20
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
=20
had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
had=20
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
on=20
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
=20
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
e=20
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
=20
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
ke=20
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=
=20
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20

=09Greg Davis=20
=09
=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=
=20
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
=20
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
=20
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses=20
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
.=20
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
=09
=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
e=20
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
n=20
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
e=20
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
e=20
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=
=20
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
s=20
on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
=09?? Lane=20
=09
=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
t=20
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
,=20
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20
anymore.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =
no-=20
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=
r =20
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=
, =20
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =
=20
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=
 =20
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=
=20
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=
ll=20
would  love to see a consistent running game.=20
=09?? Brian Gannon=20
=09
=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The=
=20
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
se=20
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=
=20
using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop=
hy=20
of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass."=20
=09?
=09
=09Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no=
=20
redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,=
=20
if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE! =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri=
ver's=20
seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20
doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear=
=20
hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F=
or=20
every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal=
l=20
into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o=
f=20
the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. =
If=20
UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu=

to get to the A=02?game with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09

were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited=

greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it=

too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for=

setting the record straight.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the=
=20
receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely=
=20
coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but=
=20
Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run=
=20
on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance=
=20
to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20
opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel=

feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.=20
=09?? Brandon May=20

=09BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewh=

he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has=

been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his=

he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=

the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=
