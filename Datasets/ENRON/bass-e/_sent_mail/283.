How were the flowers?  Exotic?  I didn't get to see a live picture of them 
because they were too exotic?

Hi Eric,

I am really getting worried.  I was sitting down to
send you a message to thank you for the gorgeous
flowers and to tell you that "you are your father's
son".  In the meantime, I received that hillarious
e-card from you.  You guessed it - your father sent me
the very same card!!!  You two are amazing.

Thank you for the card and the flowers.  I love you,
too, and I will ALWAYS be here for you.  Mom
