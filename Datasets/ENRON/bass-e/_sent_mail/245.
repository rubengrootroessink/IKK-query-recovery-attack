That sounds like a good idea.  I guess you will be taking the day off?

Hi Guys. How's it hanging? You still alive  Eric? Long time no see. I'm
thinking about grilling a few things, like chicken and scrimp, on election
night, Nov. 7. Are you guys interested in attending? Guests are included.
Let me know. Have a good week.-Dad
