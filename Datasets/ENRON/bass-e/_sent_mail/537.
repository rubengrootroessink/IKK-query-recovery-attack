Good afternoon. Mother suggested that maybe it  would be fun if the trip to 
see The University of Houston beat Texas @  Austin,were boys only. Say you, 
me and Jason. I suspect that has  to do?  with her "don't give a do-do" 
attitude about football. Thought I would pass it  on. What do  you think?-Dad
