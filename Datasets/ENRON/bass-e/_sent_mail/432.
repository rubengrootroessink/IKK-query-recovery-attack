Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian
