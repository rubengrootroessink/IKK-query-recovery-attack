what's up with the migraines? that is two weekends in a row!  the concert was 
good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear 
black ballon and name - so i was happy.   i felt sick this weekend too - so 
mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.  I did get 
to go to a game at my new field (Enron).  It is a great place to see a 
ballgame.  You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and 
the Astrodome.

I left early on Friday b/c I am a shooter :)  The Fam is great and Jason has 
not found a new job yet.  

Phew! I think I got all of them (the questions, that is).

MY WEEKEND WAS O.K.  I HAD A MIGRAINE FOR MOST OF FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE FESTIVAL.  WAS IT FUN?  DID YOU
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND?  WHY DID YOU LEAVE SO EARLY ON FRIDAY?  HOW'S THE FAM?
DID JASON FIND A NEW JOB YET?
