I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!
