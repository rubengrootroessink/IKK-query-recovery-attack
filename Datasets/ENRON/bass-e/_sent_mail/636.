   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that "The Muslim's Handbook," written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   "I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes," said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.
