Michael is a happily married man.  He would never think about any other girl 
but Sheila - or so he tells me.  Now, I, on the other hand.  Uhhhhh .... 
wait, never mind!

I am free pretty much every day for lunch this week, I won't know until later 
in the week about next week.

  I hope you were only thinking good things!
  I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended
family in Fairfield.
  Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?
They have the
  cutest kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time
with them.  I
  had fun at your birthday party!  When do I get to take you
to PF's for
  lunch?

  Yes I did.  I was just thinking about you.  I'm really glad
you showed up.
  I'm also sorry to hear about your grandma.  I will keep her
in my prayers.
  I had a fun and relaxing weekend, and I'm really glad you
were a part of it
  :-).  Did you have fun?
