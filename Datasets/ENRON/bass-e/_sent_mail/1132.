Subject: Sitara Access

I am in the process of updating the Sitara Security database and need to 
verify the following information:

Do you currently use Sitara?  If you do, answer the following questions 
also.  If you do not use Sitara, then just let me know so that I can make the 
necessary updates.
What group are you in (e.g. Logistics, Risk Management, Trading, Settlements, 
Volume Management, etc.)?
What desks to you deal with (e.g. West, East, Texas, HPLC, All, etc.)?  
Please list only the ones you deal with and need access to.

Please provide responses to the questions noted above so that I can ensure 
that you have the adequate security for Sitara.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at x35423.  Otherwise, please reply to me as soon as you can 
so that I can make the necessary updates.

Imelda Frayre (Sitara)
