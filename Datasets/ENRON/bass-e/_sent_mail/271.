Yeah, yeah, I know.  I already apologized and it won't happen again.  Once 
again, sorry I wrote down the wrong time.  I'll be there at 6:30 this week.

P.S. Do you really have better things to do?

Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do 
have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will 
not show up.  So, let me know whether or not you will be there.
