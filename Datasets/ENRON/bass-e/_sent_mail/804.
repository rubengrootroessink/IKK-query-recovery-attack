Things to Remember:
We cannot see the future. We cannot change the past.
We can only live in the now with an eye towards
gaining enough power in the future to wreak revenge on
everyone who ever screwed us in the past.

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and
allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown
in jail if you really tried them.

Love means never having to say, "Does that twenty
include the spanking?

To truly love another, you must first love yourself.
And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between
either.

A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It
can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But,
if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see
your physician.

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably
consider dating outside the family.

If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks.
Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to
the groin. That'll learn him.

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver
and precious to the recipient. But giving the finger
is free, too, and I find it more personal and sincere.
