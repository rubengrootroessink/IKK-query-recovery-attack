Subject: PEP System - Supervisor Data

Your supervisor information provided by the A/A program for loading into the 
PEP system was either missing, or invalid.  Please send me the correct 
information, being careful to list the supervisor's complete name.  In 
general, we use the supervisor of record on 5/1/00 for mid-year reviews, but 
let me know if we need to make an exception, particularly if your supervisor 
of that date is no longer an Enron employee.  

Thank you.

Terry Bosien
