If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are 
eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed 
your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial 
associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation 
that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the 
Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these 
promotion guidelines going forward.

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
