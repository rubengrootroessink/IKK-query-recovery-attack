A Report From the 2000 World Women's Liberation Conference The
 first speaker, a lady from England stood up and said,"During last years'
conference we spoke about being more assertive with our husbands.
 Well, after the conference I went home and told my husband,
 Barrington,that I would no longer cook for him and that he would have to do
it himself!
 After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw
nothing.But on the third day, I saw that he had cooked a wonderful roast
lamb." The crowd cheered.
 The second speaker, a lady from Russia stood up and said, "After last
years'conference I went home and told my husband, Ivan, that I would no
longer do his laundry and that he would have to do it himself.
After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw nothing.But
on the third day, I saw that he had done not only his own washing, but my
washing as well." The crowd again cheered.
 The third speaker, a Cajun lady from Thibodaux, Louisiana, stood
 up and said, "Afta last years' conference, I went rat home and tole dat
lazy Coonass husband'a mine, Boudreaux, dat I wadn't gonna do no mo'a his
