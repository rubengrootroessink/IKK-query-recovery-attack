Did this include any ICAP ? Do we have any idea of who is bidding that one ? I think we need to frame a reverse RFP on this one to see if we could get some-one to buy 4.50$ without the congestion.

Here is the feedback ....

they got 12 responses and shortlisted four
We were number 10 or 11 on the list  (our fixed was 3.75, with 1.50 floating and $500 per unit start charge for 5 yrs, 3 - GE LM 6000)
winning bid was over $5 - I am guessing around $5.50
they think their congestion premium should be around $1 

hope to get more information in the near future

thanks

Woody
