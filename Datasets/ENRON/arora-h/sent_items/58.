Harry and Brandon:
 
Apparently, we are not as competitive as we need to be here.  Let me know if there's anything we can do here to make this more attractive.  My quote to them is at the bottom of the thread.

Greg:

We have completed our evaluation of the two proposed structures (1) May

through September and (2) June through August for a three year duration

beginning in 2003.  Unfortunately, based on the prices quoted below, neither

evaluates well enough that we would want to pursue any further.  We

appreciate your interest and remain interested in any future proposals you

may want to offer.

Regards,

Wayne Hilson
