Hi Darren
 
 
You sure did.  
 
The whole thing going around here just convinces me how the basic economics and business ideas work as they should.  They all loved us for nearly four years - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us. The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend time looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the next Enron.
 
As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it through, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - why would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here is availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  Once the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay. 
 
In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest commodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.
 
 
Harry

thought that would catch your attention. Just seeing how you are doing and what your view is on Enron cash liquidity these days...5 and 10 yr paper trades worse than junk. Hope you & Nicole are doing alright.
