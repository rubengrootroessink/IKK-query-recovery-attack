Hi Nik
 
 
This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.
 
Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
 
I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.

Harry:
 
I am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.
 
But I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.
 
Bye for now and keep in touch.
