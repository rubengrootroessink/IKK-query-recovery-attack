Shaka man

Hope you are having a good time.  Things did indeed move out of control sooner than anyone could have imagined.  Its been one heck of an experience watching the situation and learning about how leadership works and how markets can make you and destroy you.

As to what next, my first idea is to just take time off and chill out for a few weeks and then see what to do next.

Talk to you soon


Harry
