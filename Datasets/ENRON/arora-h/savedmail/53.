Miguel,

EGEP extends our best wishes to you on pursuing your new assignment and expresses sincere appreciation for all of your assistance with our DealBench projects. 

You probably follow the DealBench activity but if you haven't watched specific details, we have observed the following activity level to date:
	India Deal Rooms A-G		9573 Deal and Document hits (since 27 Dec when stats became available)
	India Deal Room  H		  417 Deal and Document hits (since opening 1 Feb)
	China Deal Rooms A-B		  500 Deal and Document hits (since opening 23 Feb)

We consider the DealBench datarooms a great success.  We appreciate the insights you shared with us when we were first designing the rooms, as well as, the support  you provided with regard to our questions and problems thereafter.  You were always knowledgeable, resourceful, responsive and courteous in all of our dealings.

Thanks again, Miguel.  We will miss you in the DealBench project group but will look forward to hearing about your new assignment.  

Sincerely,
Paula
