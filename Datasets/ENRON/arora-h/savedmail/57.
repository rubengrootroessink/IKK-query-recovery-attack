Hi Harry,
 
Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.  How's everything in Houston?  Things in banking are slowing  down.  I'm just hoping that this project I'm staffed on will go live.   There is a 90% chance.  Most activity now in Asia is M&A related.   You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.  High yield and convertibles appear to be rocketing.  I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but so far things are  okay.    Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to park the  money.  Maybe I'll invest it in power technology since California  lacks electricity.  Who knows.  
 
I heard from Jens that you moved to Enron Online.  Jens got a great  vacation in Cuba.  I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.
 
Best regards,
 
Roy
