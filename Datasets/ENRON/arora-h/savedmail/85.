Effective March 2, Harry Arora will be leaving DealBench to join Enron Americas' East Power Desk.  Harry and his team have done an excellent job of launching and growing the DealBench business.  We thank him for his contributions and wish him the best in his new role at Enron Americas.

Moving forward, the DealBench effort will be jointly headed by Suresh Raghavan and Jeff Bartlett, who will report to Greg Piper and continue the development and marketing of the platform for Enron and other customers.
