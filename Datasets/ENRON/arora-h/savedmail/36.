Nick

Hope things are going well.

In the next few days we need to do two things.

1. Set the termination value of the existing options
2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.

Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
would like to talk to you to manage that.

We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
options, to ensure a good execution.

When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader
or myself (713-853-6750) a call, or point us in the right direction.

Thanks


Harry
