Hi Dave,

	The slides for today's options session may be found on the following drive:
			m:power2\options\power options course notes\Introduction to Power Options Lecture Notes (11-19-01).ppt

	Will you please forward this information to the attendees.

	As per your request, I made it fairly introductory - since you stated that the participants may be on different levels wrt to their options knowledge.

	However, they stated that they would like the next section to be more advanced - for example to jump right into the crack spread module that I gave to you guys a few weeks ago, along with a few cases studies discussions from originators, generation investments, etc.


Thanks,
Iris
