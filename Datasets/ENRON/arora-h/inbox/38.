I fully understand.  We're dealing with some unprecedented uncertainties here.  Just want to make sure we keep on top of opportunities on the assumption we all pull out of this mess.
 
All the best,
 
Greg

Greg 

There has been just too many rumors flying around here to quote real long term deals.  Give me a day or so to put numbers on long dated deals.

Harry: 

Any idea when you'll get a chance to respond to these questions?  I'd like to get back to my counterparties ASAP.  Understand you're probably very busy.  Just give me an estimate, if you can.

Regards, Greg

Harry, Iris and Brandon: 

Just finished up another call with my counterparty at Dominion.  Here are the opportunities: 

1.      GridSouth - (They really want to dump in "CP&L East" - anything we can do to facilitate         this will better meet customer requirements.

                Capacity:       2003 - 100MW 
                                2004 - 250MW 
                                2005 - 570MW for five years 

        Will accept day-ahead dispatch.  Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability. 

                Heat Rate:      7200 
                VOM             $2/MWh 

2.      Entergy - 

                They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price. 

                Capacity:       65MW 
                Start Date:     July 2002 
                Term:           5 Years 
                Price:          $x/MWh 

3.      TVA - Peaker 

                Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time. 

                Capacity:       Tell me what, if any, we can do. 
                Start Date:     June 2004 
                Availability:   5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar 
                Heat Rate:      10,900 
                VOM:            $2/MWh 

                Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.  If absolutely not available for 4hr                min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.  If this is absolutely not possible, let's try          to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

4.      TVA - Combined Cycle 

                This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning              1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.  This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.                 Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to              8hrs.

Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.  Thanks for all your work.  I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.

Regards, Greg
