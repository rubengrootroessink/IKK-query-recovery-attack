Dear Rajan,
Sat sri akal. I am pleased to inform you that to-day morning we declared
open GURUNANAK PRIMARY HEALTH CLINIC from the benevolent hands of Sant Ji
Baba Harbans Singh Jee Kar Sewa Wale. This all has been done with the main
initiative from your side. All the committee members send you the greetings
for this noble cause which was a major initiation from your side. God bless
you and wish that this gets good success and the people are benefitted . We
had called local MLA and other senior officails on this occasion . I will
send you the photographs taken on this occasionI am sure you would like
.There was a good gathering. One of the members from the people who had come
with Baba jee had mentioned that this is the beginning of a hospital or a
big clinic . We pray to Waheguru  that your wishes and desires for the
upliftment bring good result and there is always  a good initiation from
your side for such causes for the welfare of humankind. Our Sangat was also
very happy on this function. To-day is the birthday day of Khalsa and I send
you the best wishes for the same and my Congrat.
Mummy is taking medicines regularly . We had been to the doctor yesterday
