Harry and Steve,

Couple of updates on the TVA tolls:

Please change the gas assumption to NYMEX + $.50/mmBtu (this adder is a fixed cost so it should not be affected by volatility)
Also, price the 200 MWs for a 3 year term starting 6/1/03 and the 500MWs for a 3 year term starting 1/1/02.  Sorry for the confusion.

What kind of time frame do you see for providing an indicative offer for these two products?

Thanks.

- Nick
