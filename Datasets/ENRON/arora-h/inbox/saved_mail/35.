Harry,
Greetings from Washington, DC.

I am trying to resend the message. Somehow I didn't get the confirmed
delivery message.

Pardon me if you receive this twice.

Hi Harry:

Thanks for your comments and suggestions. I think they are right on.
I actually spent a lot of time last night reshaping the resume. Couldn't
forward this to you this morning, somehow the remote connection
was not working.

Here is the new look. Let me know if this works.

I am in Reston, VA today and will be here till Thursday afternoon.
Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions.

Thanks a lot

Cheers,
Gurmeet

Gurmeet

I spoke to John Lavo who runs the Americas group. He wanted to have a
look at your resume.  I was wondering if you could slant your resume to
energy somewhat further and make it punchier because this resume does
come out as a generalist resume. Also some price risk management
consulting (not the cost side but top line ) would be helpful.

Give me a call when you get a chance.


Harry

Hi Harry:

Didn't see you at the gurudwara yesterday. The planned Kirtan event
never
took place
so Uncle and Aunty didn't miss anything.

Just wanted to follow up and send you my resume, in case you need this
for
the meeting.

Let me know the next steps.

Thanks for your help


Cheers,
Gurmeet
