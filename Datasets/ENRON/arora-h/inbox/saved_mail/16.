>>temper at all. He told his father about it and the
>>father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail
>>for each day that he was able to hold his temper.
>>
>>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to
>>tell his father that all the nails were gone.
>>The father took his son by the hand and led him to the
>>fence.
>>He said, "You have done well, my son, but look at the
>>holes in the fence. The fence will never be the
>>same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar
>>just like this one.
>>You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It
>>won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the
>>wound is still there. A verbal wound is as bad as a
>>physical one.
>>Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you
>>smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear,
