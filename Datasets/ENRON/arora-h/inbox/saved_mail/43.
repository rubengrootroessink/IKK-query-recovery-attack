Mr. Ramiro G Vazquez Assistant Director Sales & Technical Services of "Merichem Chemical & Refinery Services" was here in India and was remembering you. He was again asking to tell you  his interest for working with Enron. Then in his other official mail, he asked " did you speak to your nephew". Looks he is impressed with your talk for a few minutes.
 
I am sure you must be in regular touch with Ashoo. She likes and expects dear ones to remain in touch with her regularly.
 
She also now is becoming busy in her studies etc. When you plan to visit Dallas.
 
Rest all is O. K. your Aantie does remember you. How is Nicole.
 
So   Barother, This year's Houston quota for stay is getting over. What is your programme for New Jersey. When you plan to leave for London and what is date of return to India. How is Bharjee jee our regards to her.
