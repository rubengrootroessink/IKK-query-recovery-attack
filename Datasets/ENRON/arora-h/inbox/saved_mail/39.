Harry,
Thanks for taking some to talk today.  Below is some marketing material that we have put together on real estate derivatives.  Hopefully you'll be hearing more about this in the future.  I also attached my resume.  I am currently looking for a rotation and I know you guys are pretty set, but keep me in mind if things change.
Thanks,
