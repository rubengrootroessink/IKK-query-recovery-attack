The attached resume is from an options trader at Coral that comes highly recommended.   I think he would be a great addition to the options desk.   Please work with Charles Taylor in HR to expedite the interview/recruiting process.

I recommend you start defining the options reporting requirements (use gas reports as starting point) and maybe spend some time with Greg Woulfe (former East Power options trader who now works in EBS) to pick his brain on what is necessary to expand the market and manage an options desk effectively.

Thanks.
