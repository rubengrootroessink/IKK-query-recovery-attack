Harry,

I hope all is going well in Houston.  Thanks again for introducing me around
Enron when I cam to visit a couple months ago.  Hopefully you heard that I
accepted the internship and will be starting on June 4th.  I am very excited
about getting involved with Enron, learning as much as possible, and
hopefully contributing value to some interesting projects.

I am writing you for some advice.  I do not know which group I will be
working in this summer.  I am very excited about the company and would like
to perform well once I start.  Is there something I could do to prepare
myself?  I would like to begin reading and learning about the industry.
Unfortunately, Enron is involved in several industries, making it difficult
to know which to research.  Do you have any suggestions?

I look forward to seeing you this summer.

Sincerely,

Vic
