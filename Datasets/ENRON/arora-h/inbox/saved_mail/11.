Harry,
Sorry for the  delay.  Here is our Business Plan.  As you can see, we are in the  Vidigo Compression business.  We have developed a proprietary compression  capability which produces video of superior quality and size with approximately  half the file size resulting in substantial cost savings.  We have also  developed proprietary marketing applications based on our core technology  ie.VidiMercial and Vidigo Previews. We are currently looking for a bridge  financing on the order of $2m which should carry us to cash flow positive.   We are now beginning to roll out our technology.   I would be glad to meet  you.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
