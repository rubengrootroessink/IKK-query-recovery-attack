What's in store
Investors get ready to ride into smoother waters  
 
By Carla Drysdale, columnist 
 
As we bid farewell to a year in which many of us dealt 
directly with loss of lives, jobs, and investments, the 
Big Ball of 2002 is poised to bring in what we hope will 
be a brighter new year. Now, more than halfway 
through the fourth quarter, the venture capital market 
is still far from robust. Where will it go from here and 
which will be the startups that drive VC investments in 
2002? 
 
For the moment, venture capitalists are putting most 
of their money into saving existing businesses, rather 
than starting new ones. According to data from 
VentureWire, a division of New York-based 
Technologic Partners, halfway through the fourth 
quarter, seed money and first-round financing 
accounted for just 12 percent of all disbursements, 
down from 25 percent in the first quarter.

WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR

Equity Funds End Moderately Higher Despite Fading 
Hopes for Stimulus Package   

As debate over the stimulus package rages on, US 
stock funds managed to finish the week slightly ahead 
of the previous week. Natural resource funds lead the 
fund sectors due to anticipated supply cuts.

Personal finance

1. Insurance on MultexPF
Smoking and life insurance

Looking for a reason to quit smoking? It costs you 
money! We all know that purchasing cigarettes and 
cigars cost money, but you need to add the 
significantly higher cost to purchase life insurance to 
that expense.
