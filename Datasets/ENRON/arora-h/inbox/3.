Harry - I got kicked out of the system, so I'm sending this from Tom's account. He can fill you in on the potential deal with STEAG. I left my resume on your chair. I'll e-mail a copy when I have my home account running. My contact info is: 

Home: (713) 523-8299
E-mail: ugulmeden@yahoo.com - this may bounce for a week until I clean the account

Good luck and hope to stay in touch!
