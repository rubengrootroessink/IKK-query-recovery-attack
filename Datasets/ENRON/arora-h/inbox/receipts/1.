Dear Dr. Lay,

	My name is Iris Mack.  My former boss - Vince Kaminski  - asked me to become involved with Howard University's development of its new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I recently moved from the Houston Research group to the Power Options trading desk - as indicated in the forwarded email.

	My new boss - Harry Arora - is very agreeable to my being a part of the Enron team to assist Howard in the development of the ISE.

	Looking forward to working with you and the ofther members of Howard's Board of Trustees on such an exciting project.

Kind regards,
Iris Mack

Dear All,

	As many of you may already know, I will be moving to the Power Trading group.  My new position will allow me to combine my experience in derivatives, as well as my knowledge of the power industry.  

?	My derivatives experience:  Recently, I worked on Credit Derivatives pricing models for Enron Credit.  In addition, I worked as a derivatives structurer at Investment Banque BNP Paribas in London, where I also obtained my licenses in Securities, Regulations and Derivatives.  In addition, I spent my summers in Associateships and consulting positions in derivatives pricing at Salomon Brothers and Charles Schwab. Finally, I conducted real options academic research at MIT.

?	My power experience:  My Harvard PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics had applications to the "transient stability analysis of electrical power systems."  In addition, my London Business School MBA thesis was entitled "Day-Ahead Lunch-Time Electricity Demand Forecasting:  Applications to Electricity and Weather Derivatives".  


I really enjoyed my time working in the Research Group, as well as my time supporting Enron Credit.  

Looking forward to working with you in the future!


Kind regards,
Iris
