Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Gone digital
Companies with digital in their names seem to be on a roll.

By Dave Sterman

Whats in a name? Plenty, if youre talking about the word "digital." 
Screening for fast-growing Net stocks, we found that three of them use 
that ubiquitous moniker in their title. Recently, we chronicled the bright 
prospects for Digital Insight (DGIN).

This week, were looking at the other digitals, and found a pretty 
ompelling investment case for each of those as well. Both DigitalThink 
(DTHK) and Digital River (DRIV) are taking advantage of the unique selling 
properties associated with the Web.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Charge!!!
Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investors 
will come to the rescue of the street.

by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, Wall 
Street Strategies

Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance 
went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Taliban 
back on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels in 
the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested 
that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree that 
the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believe 
that the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I think 
the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released 
last Wednesday, once again beating expectations. 

In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumer 
sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates, 
and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, I 
dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.
