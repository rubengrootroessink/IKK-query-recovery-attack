IN DEFENSE OF FREE SPEECH

The intimidation campaign against New York radio talk-show
personality "Grandpa" Al Lewis's website ISP is by no means unique.
Recent efforts to suppress the voices of ideological opponents are
widespread and not limited to one particular ideology or viewpoint.

While "Grandpa Munster" drew ire for his outspoken views in
opposition to the U.S. government responses to the Sept. 11th
atrocities, some on American college campuses have been reprimanded
for voicing support for the U.S. military response -- or even for
simply displaying American flags, according to Paul Craig Roberts,
research fellow at The Independent Institute.

"It is permissible to burn the American flag on university campuses.
But don't try waving one," writes Roberts in his syndicated column.

College administrators on some campuses have ordered the removal of
American flags from student dorm rooms and school buses, and banned
the staff of a university TV station from wearing red, white and blue
ribbons. Some professors have also been demoted or had their websites
shutdown.

At San Diego State University one Arabic-speaking Ethiopian student
was put on warning when he chastised three Arab students he heard
"expressing their delight in the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon," writes Roberts.

American colleges and universities were once famous for permitting
all forms of speech to be heard in the "marketplace of ideas." Too
often today we see one form of orthodoxy trying to silence another --
all to the detriment of the spirit of free inquiry and open debate.

One need not agree with Noam Chomsky's political leanings to
recognize genuine patriotism when he said, "If we don't believe in
freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it
at all."

ANTITRUST SETTLEMENT BODES WELL FOR CONSUMERS

Last week's settlement between Microsoft and the U.S. Justice
Department is good news for consumers because it does little to
hamper Microsoft, according to economist Dominick Armentano, a
research fellow at The Independent Institute, in an op-ed published
in Canada's NATIONAL POST.

The settlement -- still to be approved by the federal judge assigned
to the case and several state attorneys general -- would require
Microsoft to adopt certain specific operating practices (namely to
stop engaging in exclusive dealing arrangements with computer makers,
share its Windows source code with competitors, and allow computer
makers more freedom to display non-Microsoft software applications).

Microsoft, however, has already nearly abandoned its exclusivity
arrangements and moved toward an "open source" arrangment, observes
Armentano.

"In short, the government got virtually nothing from this legal
monstrosity of a lawsuit, which is precisely what it deserves,"
Armentano writes. "Microsoft, on the other hand, is a clear and
decisive winner on the issue that first sparked the lawsuit: the
tying of its Web browser to its operating system."

Like the antitrust prosecution of IBM in the 1970s and early '80s,
the Microsoft antitrust case was without merit, and illustrate the
need to fundamentally reform or repeal antitrust policies, according
to Armentano.

"Antitrust has a long and sorry history of prosecuting aggressively
competitive companies that have innovated rapidly and lowered prices
to consumers. And most antitrust 'remedies' attempt to restrain
(price) competition -- witness the provision in the Microsoft
settlement that requires published rates and uniform discounts -- or
make it easier for less efficient firms to do more business.

"Consumers and businessmen need free, open markets and they need
protection from force and fraud. They don't need antitrust regulation
and protectionism that hampers innovation and harms society,"
Armentano concludes.

HOW THE FDA HELPED RETARD CHILD DEVELOPMENT

When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved
two new additives for infant formula, the agency's leaders cheered
that the FDA was hard at work to improve children's health. The
additives -- DHA and AA, two fatty acids present in breast milk --
play an important role in the development of healthy brains and eyes.

Unfortunately, as Alexander Tabarrok, Research Director at The
Independent Institute points out, the FDA could have safely approved
the additives years ago but didn't.

Britain, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands and more than 50
other countries have been using DHA- and AA-enhanced infant formula
for years, but this did not help speed up the approval of the infant
formula additives in the United States. Consequently, millions of
babies have been denied the benefits of 4 more I.Q. points and
approximately one line of better vision on a standard eye chart.

This horror story is but one example in the long history of FDA
over-caution. "Numerous studies have shown that FDA rules and
regulations have resulted in high prices, fewer new drugs, and long
delays in getting new drugs to market," writes Tabarrok in a recent
op-ed.

How can the FDA be reformed, so that Americans can enjoy the benefits
of pharmaceutical innovation more quickly?

"As a good first step," writes Tabarrok, "the U.S. should establish
reciprocity agreements with countries that have a proven record of
approving safe drugs -- including most western European countries,
Canada, Japan, and Australia.

"If the U.S. and, say, Britain had a reciprocity agreement, for
example, then drugs and supplements approved in Britain would gain
immediate approval in the U.S., and vice-versa. Such an arrangement
would reduce delay, and eliminate duplication and wasted resources."
