Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can equipment makers overcome a capex slowdown in 2002?
Analysts believe that a few stocks are worth buying despite continued belt 
tightening.

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The 2002 capex picture for large carriers is coming into focus, and it isn't 
pretty. The push to control spending will continue, and capex budgets look 
to be slashed by an average of 25 percent next year.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Better safe than sorry
In an insecure world, Corporate America is investing in security software

By Carla Drysdale

If you're like me, a "virus warning" in your email inbox isn't likely to faze you. 
You click on it and glance through it, with a vague sense of gratitude that 
the warning will hopefully prevent your computer from imploding. 

So at first I took it in stride when I received a message saying: "If you receive 
an email entitled 'Bad Times,' delete it IMMEDIATELY. Apparently this one is 
pretty nasty." 

I thought, okay, and I kept reading. "It will not only erase everything on your 
hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your 
computer...It will do all your drugs and drink all your liquor." Now that's a nasty 
virus! While this science fiction scenario might have been written by someone 
who's seen The Matrix once too often, it is a tongue-in-cheek reminder that smart 
hackers can wreak all kinds of havoc. 

Fortunately for the makers of anti-virus software, Fortune 100 companies are 
acutely aware of the problem, and they are keeping security software firms busier 
than ever--and that makes them an attractive target for private equity as well.
