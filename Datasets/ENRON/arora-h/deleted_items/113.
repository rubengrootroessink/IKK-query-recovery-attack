THINK OUT OF THE BOX (THE MAILBOX, THAT IS) 
And get a $5 credit on your AT&T Universal Card statement.

Do away with paper statements. Do it all online.

Then simply go to "Manage My Account" and click on "Stop 
Paper Statements"

YOU PAY YOUR BILL ELECTRONICALLY. 
WHY NOT GET YOUR STATEMENTS THAT WAY, TOO? 

You pay your bills online. Why not get your statements that same 
convenient way? In addition to paying electronically, you'll be 
able to view your statements whenever you like. Online statements 
are another free feature of Account Online. One that frees you of 
paper and paperwork, not to mention paper cuts.

GET A $5 CREDIT ON YOUR AT&T UNIVERSAL CARD STATEMENT.

When you sign up before November 30, 2001, you'll receive a 
special bonus: a $5 credit on your AT&T Universal Card statement.* 
Simply manage your account electronically for four statement 
periods, and we'll automatically credit your account.

YOU'RE A FEW CLICKS AWAY FROM LESS PAPERWORK IN YOUR LIFE.

Instead of filing, sorting and trying to remember where you 
put things, get your AT&T Universal Card statements online. An email 
each month lets you know that your statement is ready. 
Simply log on to Cardmember Central to get your bill or make 
your payment. Still want a paper statement? Just print it out. 
A click's a lot faster than waiting for snail mail. So you'll 
save some time for more important things. Like life. 

Not only will you do away with paper statements, you'll be 
on your way to getting a $5 statement credit.
