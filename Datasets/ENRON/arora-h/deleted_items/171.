Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Picks and pans: Telecom favorites and has-beens
Charles Payne rates 17 telecom stocks that sank like hot air balloons for their 
ability to regain altitude or not.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies 

The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all 
the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the 
bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they 
were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when 
the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air 
balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing). 
Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with 
the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering 
altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will 
indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than 
advertised.

2. Upwards revisions: Better and better
Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual 
opportunities.

By Dave Sterman

Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, 
sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices 
on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare 
chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices.

With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector 
that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly 
inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the  
accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in 
relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7. 

And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation, 
we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three "strong buy" ratings, 
and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.

3. Upside potential: Unusual support looms for tower stocks
Debt burdens and zoning laws may seem like unlikely benefits, but there you 
have it.

By Dave Sterman

Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators 
are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks. 
Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong, 
and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have 
characterized the rest of the telecom industry.

That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong 
stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping 
levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating 
landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable 
the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of 
the pie.

4. International wires: From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining 
analyst esteem.

BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst 
esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating, 
but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better 
than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 ("buy"). 
What gives?

5. Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile 
handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone 
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset 
shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22% 
in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging 
to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with 
Sony (SNE).
