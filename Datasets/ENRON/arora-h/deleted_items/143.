Hi,=20

        FYI, the options sessions for the originators begin today.=20

        The location for the first session is ECS05990.=20

        Once we get past the basics of options, then the plan is to focus o=
n more advanced topics - exotic options, load following, cross-commodity st=
ructures, etc.

        Perhaps during these more advanced sessions some of you guys would =
like to make presentations.=20

Thanks,=20
Iris=20
