Our gifts to you this week: Several reports that offer insight into the 
current market rally. Other topics of discussion include: a way to tap 
your life insurance benefit if you're terminally ill, and how to combine 
your retirement accounts the right way.

Charles Payne, principal analyst of Wall Street Strategies, explains why 
he remains upbeat on stocks despite the lack of a potent Santa Claus

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Watch out for Web services
Venture capitalists count the many ways of metaware

By Carla Drysdale, columnist

As technology and the information age continues to both enrich and 
complicate our lives, chief information officers are becoming more 
excited about an emerging field that promises to smooth out some of the 
operational kinks. Web services, or what is sometimes called 
"metaware," may well describe the offering of many companies that 
attract venture financing next year. 

The next stage in the evolution of software, the solution would allow 
companies to transfer business functions to the Internet, and off 
proprietary networks and hardware systems.

The technology would allow a company to send updates to software 
across different operating systems, devices and computers. Instead of 
updating all servers and computers one by one, they could do it once,

disappointments during the previous week. 

Economic data that came down the pike during the week also painted a 
picture of slow recovery at best. Yet there are reasons for investors to 
feel optimistic while knocking back the eggnog (no doubt spiked a little 
heavier than usual) this Christmas Day. Last week the initial jobless 
claims came in lower than the previous week, stretching this trend to 
three weeks. Now, the four-week average is 438,000, not below the 
pivotal 400,000 but significantly lower than the 508,000 posted just a

WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR 
--------------------------

Fixed income funds retreat as year-end issues & the Fed rate cuts affect 
returns. Despite another Federal Funds rate cut, taxable income funds 
were down modestly from the previous week. Profit taking and other 
year-end investment strategies also appear to be impacting fund 
performance.
