Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile 
handset industry. The segments top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone 
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

Its no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset shipments 
were down by 10% over last year. Motorolas (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter, 
and Ericssons (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line 
that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Angelic missions rising
As VC funding slows, angel investors find new wings.

By Carla Drysdale

As the country struggles to its feet after the crash of the new economy, 
exacerbated by the Sept. 11th attacks on the WTC, angel investors have 
been doing their part to help by continuing to provide seed money to startups. 

Angels, entrepreneurs-turned-investors, first earned this moniker during 
depression-era New York by bailing out ailing Broadway theatre companies. 
Since then, angel investments, along with those of venture capitalists, have 
expanded from Broadway to the Internet and beyond. Now, because traditional 
VCs are slowing the pace of investments, angels have new opportunities to 
swoop down to fill in the seed-stage gap.
