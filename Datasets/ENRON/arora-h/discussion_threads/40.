Here is McKinsey's work.  Broad overview only, with no specific analysis of 
grains, meats or softs.  Priorities here are grains, then meats, and 
separately 
softs given our existing exposure to this segment (53k Tons of Cocoa Physical,
Softs Brokerage Business in London).

Mark, I would encourage you to come down to 29 (assuming you are on 33) and
we will be more than happy to share all of our resources to get you up to 
speed
on our analysis and why we think these segments hold a lot of opportunity.

Regards,
Darren Maloney
