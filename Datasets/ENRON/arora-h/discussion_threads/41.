Looks like EES has pretty much decided to use us for this RFQ (see the Word 
doc attached below) -- remember that we have a meeting scheduled with EES on 
Monday to discuss a "realtionship" and pricing.  Let's make sure before our 
meeting that we are all in agreement as to the pricing approach we will take 
with them.
