Wow !! Big brother is watching you... Thanks for your message. Actually, we
are quite impressed by how smooth the whole process is. But I think that my
colleague is talking to you at the moment... So far so good. We will see how
banks respond to the system. Many thanks indeed. With kind regards, JM

Hi Jean-Maurice,

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how your DealBench experience
is going.  I realize you may have some colleagues that are working with you
that may not have been in our demo in November.  I'm happy to spend some
time with them on the phone walking through the functionality within the
site.  Please feel free to call me at 713-345-3726.

I look forward to hearing from you to know how things are going.

Kind Regards,
Kristi DeMaiolo
