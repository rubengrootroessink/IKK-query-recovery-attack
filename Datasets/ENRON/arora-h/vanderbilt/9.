Harry,

Thank you for taking time last week to meet with me and for arranging the
other meetings as well.  I enjoyed our discussion and learning about the
various opportunities within Enron.  I have been impressed with every group
at Enron.  I hope that we can keep in touch over the next few months.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,


Vic
