Heather,

Per our conversation, I am going to go ahead and process this order without 
the keyboards and/or mice.  The desktops, monitors and Palm Pilots come to 
roughly $34,000, which means I will need approval from a Sr. Director before 
I can place the order.  Can you have the appropriate person send me an email 
with his/her approval?  I will place the order as soon as I have that.  
Thanks!
