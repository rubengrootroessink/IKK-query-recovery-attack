Dear Mr. Arora:
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time and
effort to come to Owen and interview me for the Summer Associate Program at
Enron. I am excited about the prospect of developing newer markets and
e-markets for trading various financial instruments and wish to be a part of
the Enron team in the development of these new markets. I firmly believe
that my past experience in the commodities trading area and my finance and
e-commerce concentration at Owen would enable me to make a significant
contribution in developing newer markets and e-markets for various
commodities & products and would greatly appreciate an opportunity to be a
part of the Enron team. Many Thanks once again for interviewing me for the
summer associate program at Enron.

Sincerely,
Muthu (Max)
