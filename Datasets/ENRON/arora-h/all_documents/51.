Dear Mr. Arora:

Once again, thank you for the great opportunity to demonstrate and prove my
credentials, interest and desire to work for Enron this summer during the
second round of on-campus interview at the Owen Graduate School of
Management at Vanderbilt University on January 24th. Although I have not
been selected for the Summer Associate position at Enron, I would like to
assure you that I am still interested in a full-time position at Enron upon
my graduation.

Meanwhile, I would greatly appreciate if you provide me with any feedback on
my performance during the interview. I am especially interested in your
opinion regarding the areas I need to improve.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dmitri Villevald
Owen MBA 2002
