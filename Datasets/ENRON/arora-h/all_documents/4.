Just got off the phone with Kira.  She asked me what y'all do and I probably
butchered it, but she sounded interested (especially when I closed by saying 
it
would be a business services, fee-based revenue stream - from what I know in
the industry, Yahoo's all about that these days, trying to find complements to
its existing largely ad-driven model for which they are getting pummeled).  
She
said you should forward any information on to her at kira@yahoo-inc.com.  To
reach her by phone (I'd recommend handling initial contact through email and
then suggesting phone time, but your call), I don't have her direct number, 
but
called the main Yahoo corporate number 408-731-3300, then used the dial by 
name
directory - her last name is spelled Zahn, but you have to keep adding letters
from her first name (i went through K-I) before it will recognize it.  She and
her husband both were in law school with me and are very, very cool folks.  He
works at Silicon Valley Bank now.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.
