Harry,

I enjoyed our interview today and hope to continue discussions with Enron
about a summer internship.

I couldn't resist sending you this link.  I don't know if you recall, but
during our talk we conducted an exercise attempting to determine new uses
for tissue.  I was surprised to learn that Kimberly-Clark has just announced
a new product.  They actually were holding a analyst conference call this
morning to discuss earnings and their new venture.  Your questions are
certainly very current!  I wish I had been creative enough to think of this
product during our interview.

Here is the link.

Again, thank you for taking the time to interview me.  I am excited about
the opportunities at Enron and look forward to continuing our discussions in
the next few weeks.

Sincerely,

Vic
