Hi Mukul

Hope you are doing well.

I am sorry I missed you on my visit to India.  I know
you were pretty tied up with the baby, and I should
have planned a little better but inevitably it always
gets to be a rush.

Later on, the day I was to leave, I asked my mom and
she told me you had called - so not only did I not see
you while I was there - I managed to not call you
back.

How are things coming along ? Hows family ? Hope
business is going well.

Email me when you get a chance.


Harry
