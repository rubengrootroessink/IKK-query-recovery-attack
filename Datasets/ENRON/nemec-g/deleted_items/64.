Eric seems to think he is in charge of this little outing. But, he is
mistaken because I am the gatekeeper of the tickets. If you have any
questions regarding the Wings Over Houston Airshow this Sunday, please
direct them to me. Thanks for your cooperation.



   This just in from Ellington Field to me.






                                    Please Note!

          Due to heightened security at all airports across the United
          States, the following rules have been issued by the FAA and
          local officials concerning attendance at our airshow:
               Because of heightened security all backpacks, coolers and
               tote bags must be left in the car and will not be allowed
               on the field.


          These rules will be enforced by officials at the gates and on
          the grounds. Your cooperation and understanding is appreciated.











                    "Gillaspie, Eric"
