Good Afternoon All,

I plan to take off this upcoming Monday, 10/22, to take care of some personal issues.  I will return to work again on the 23rd.  There will be a temporary sitting in for me.  If you should have any questions, Mary Helen Martinez at extension 52459 is my backup assistant;  she will be able to assist you in my absence, should you have the need.  Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I wish you all a wonderful weekend!
