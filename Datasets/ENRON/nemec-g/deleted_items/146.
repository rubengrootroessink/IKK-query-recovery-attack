Here's what people are saying about US SEARCH:
"At first I tried to use the "free" search databases on the 
Internet. However, after a couple of hours I saw that I was 
running around in circles, and their data was either incorrect 
or lacking. You located the individual that I was seeking, and, 
even supplied me with a correct phone number. Thanks a million." 
- M.S.
"I wanted to tell you that I was so impressed with my US SEARCH! 
You found my long lost father in less than 12 hours of my order! 
I had hired a private investigator for $150.00 and he couldn't 
find anything! Thank you so much! I am so pleased with you guys 
and will refer you to others that need your assistance. 
My reunion with my father has also been a blessing! Thank you!!!" 
- J.P.
