U2 are also up for prizes - against Limp Bizkit and Gorillaz no less - in the
MTV Europe Awards. It's the fans who decide and U2 are up for Best Group,

- At U2.COM we have just posted exclusive new video of the band performing
at the recent Video Music Awards. Watch it here ( http://www.u2.com/lite ).
In the next few days we'll be carrying the new Walk On video directed by
Jonas Akerland and the US video for Stuck In A Moment.

hooded sweatshirts to t-shirts. Check out the whole range here

- We hope to launch our interactive fan-based Zootopia area on U2.Com within
days - we'll let you know first. Meantime, don't forget to check back with
the site regularly. As the band continues their record-breaking Elevation
2001 Tour, we're posting fresh band news stories most days
