Jen,

I guess my only question is "how many beers do you think you can smuggle
under your shirt?"

Eric seems to think he is in charge of this little outing. But, he is
mistaken because I am the gatekeeper of the tickets. If you have any
questions regarding the Wings Over Houston Airshow this Sunday, please
direct them to me. Thanks for your cooperation.



   This just in from Ellington Field to me.







                                    Please Note!


          Due to heightened security at all airports across the United

          States, the following rules have been issued by the FAA and

          local officials concerning attendance at our airshow:

               Because of heightened security all backpacks, coolers and

               tote bags must be left in the car and will not be allowed

               on the field.



          These rules will be enforced by officials at the gates and on

          the grounds. Your cooperation and understanding is appreciated.












                    "Gillaspie, Eric"
