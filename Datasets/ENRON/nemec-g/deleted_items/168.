2) UNDER THE HOOD:
You're in (Re)Charge Part II: Jump-Starting Your Car

In last month's MapQuest newsletter, we gave a few ways to keep your car battery charged and vital. Our suggestions of buying trusted, name-brand batteries and performing regular cleanings can help decrease the threat of sudden battery death at an inconvenient moment. But batteries don't live forever, so with a pair of jumper cables, the help of a friendly citizen and the following easy steps, you might suffer an inconvenience when your battery goes, but you won't be stranded.

--Put both cars in park, facing each other but not touching, with emergency brakes on and engines shut off.

--Remove the caps from both cars' batteries.

--Use the red cable first, affixing one clamp to the positive terminal on each cars' battery. (The positive terminal should be marked with a + or the letters POS)

--Use the black cable second, affixing one end to the other car's negative battery terminal (often marked with a minus sign or the letters NEG) and the other to a piece of unpainted metal on your car that is at least a couple feet away from your battery and carburetor.

--Double check your connections! Today's electronic ignitions can be sensitive and costly to repair if recharged incorrectly.

--Start your car. Expect to take a leisurely drive of up to half-an-hour as your battery recharges (don't shut it off until you're in a safe place, just in case!). If your car does not start on the first attempt, try starting the other car and letting it idle for a bit, then shut it off and try again. If it's a no-go after one or two tries, it's probably time for a new battery.

3) TRAVEL DEALS:
Free Foliage Part II: Fall is for Frugal and Lavish Alike

Meet Sam and Tara. They wear Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. She's got a Volvo, he's got a BMW. Their Friday night pizzas are topped with exotic vegetables and imported cheeses.

Meet Jed and Courtney. Their idea of a fun Saturday is flea market hopping in their VW bus that still has shaggy carpet in back. Their idea of pizza is $1-a-slice take out.

November to August, these two couples have little in common. But during fall foliage season, weekend leaf peeping becomes a common ground upon which the thrifty and the extravagant can agree. For two months, the "deal" is inherent in the season.

As beautiful as those New England covered brides and old farmhouses are, stopping in the road or trespassing to take pictures isn't always a good idea. The answer? Take advantage of the nation's most treasured land -- head to the National forests and parks.

We can't give you an exhaustive list of the nation's best foliage spots within this newsletter, but here a just a few pared-down suggestions to peak (no pun intended) your interest.

Disclaimer: We know it's nearly impossible to throw a stick anywhere between Connecticut and Maine without hitting some gorgeous foliage. So choosing just one New England route is tough. But Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire is a favorite for a slew of reasons. Some of the most spectacular autumn hues in the nation, views of the stunning White Mountains, the Appalachian Trail, water falls and rivers, historical sites, a 3,700-foot mountain summit and outlet shopping and excellent coffee shops nearby, just in case you're inclined to buy a sleeping bag, camp out for the night, and wake up to a cup of morning joe.

"Never," says one New Hampshire native who spends nearly every fall weekend in the region. "Never will I get used to the Appalachian (trail) in the fall. The day I do is the day I'm no longer alive."

If you can't make it to New England, don't fret. The eastern seaboard is sprinkled with fantastic foliage posts. Those wanting to visit the Chatahoochee-Oconee National Forests in Georgia, for example, are probably receiving this newsletter right amid the region's peak season. The forest's miles and miles of hiking trails, 25 designated camp sites, white water rafting and horseback riding are just a few foliage-friendly draws.

When flying into the northwest corner of the country, it's apparent that Mt. Saint Helens isn't the only thing capable of eruption. Blinding reds and yellows are one of the main attractions in Gifford Pinchot National Forest come fall time. And while you'll just miss the huckleberry picking season, you might be inclined to break up your leaf peeping stints with a guided tour or geology workshop at the Mount St. Helens Institute.

We'd love to entice you further with tales of America's best 20-mile hikes and 100-mile panoramas, but this newsletter would never end. Our suggestion: Check out two very important sections of the MapQuest site for more ideas. The <link>scenic drives</link> section is a great place to start, thanks to information provided by the National Scenic Byways Program. For more information about MapQuest's guide to America's National Parks, see the On MapQuest section at the end of this newsletter.

4) ON MAPQUEST:
Follow the Yellow Leafed Road

Question: What do all these words have in common?
-Acadia
-Sequoia
-Shenandoah
-Isle Royale
-Hot Springs

If you guessed "they're all national parks," you should treat yourself to a nice Saturday afternoon hike and a bottled water. If you also guessed "they're all detailed on MapQuest's National Parks guide" you should throw in an extra energy bar and a few rolls of film.

It's foliage season, and the perfect time to bask in fall's colors in national park. So what kind of details can you garner from MapQuest's guide to America's treasures? As you'd expect, you'll find excellent park, trail, street and atlas maps as well as directions to and around the area. You'll also get contact information, topographic details, area scenic drive suggestions as well as camping, hiking, fishing, boating, picnicking, and hunting information.

Just one warning: Your romantic weekend plans to the Badlands could easily turn into a full-fledged vacation.
