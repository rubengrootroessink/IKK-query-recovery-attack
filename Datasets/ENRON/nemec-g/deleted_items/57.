 I  usually don't forward these but this one is particularly frightening
to me....

Don't go to the bathroom on October 28th. CIA intelligence reports that
a major plot is planned for that day. Anyone who takes a poop on the
28th will be bitten on the ass by an alligator. Reports indicate that
organized groups of alligators are planning to rise up into unsuspecting
American's toilet bowls and bite them when they are doing their dirty
business.

I usually don't send emails like this, but I got this information from a
reliable source. It came from a friend of a friend whose cousin is
dating this girl whose brother knows this guy whose wife knows this lady
whose husband buys hotdogs from this guy who knows a shoeshine guy who
shines the shoes of a mailroom worker who has a friend who's drug dealer
sells drugs to another mailroom worker who works in the CIA building. He
apparently overheard two guys talking in the bathroom about alligators
and came to the conclusion that we are going to be attacked. So it must
be true.
