DEAR RECEIVER,

You have just received a Taliban virus. Since we are
not so technologically advanced in Afghanistan, this
is a MANUAL virus.

Please delete all the files on your hard disk yourself
and send this mail to everyone you know.

Thank you very much for helping me.
Abdulla
Talibanian hacker
