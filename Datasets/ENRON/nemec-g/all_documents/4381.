Dear Fellow Diver;

I know this is late and I am truly sorry. What an exciting month it=01,s be=
en!

First, if you weren=01,t at Total Submersion, you missed out on something g=
reat!=20
I know I bought my share of drinks at My Bar at Sunset House in Grand=20
Cayman.  It was great meeting so many of you down there. We had almost one=
=20
hundred people in only our first year!  I would like to thank the staff of=
=20
Sunset House, Comfort Suites, and Treasure Island Resort, as well as the=20
great team from Sport Diver magazine, and of course our team from PADI and=
=20
PADI Travel Network for making Total Submersion event a great success.  The=
=20
weather was wonderful, the diving was incredible, the seminars were well=20
received, and everyone had a fantastic time.  But, you ain=01,t seen nothin=
g=20
yet.  Stay tuned to see what we come up with for next year!=20
http://www.sportdiver.com/totalsub.htm


We are very proud of the recent recognition PADI received from the Maritime=
=20
Division of the Friends of War Memorials with regards to the recent change =
in=20
one of our Mission Statements Goals.  We are spreading the word to our=20
network of professionals and retailers and resorts to be respectful of wrec=
ks=20
and the remains found on many wrecks around the world.  Reverend Andrew=20
Phillips from the Maritime Division in the United Kingdom acknowledged our=
=20
awareness campaign in an article in the UK Sport Diver magazine and in the=
=20
House of Commons in England.

I can=01,t tell you how many offers we=01,ve rejected to include advertisin=
g=20
materials or to even =01&rent=018 this email list. Your faith in us not to =
do this=20
has resulted in a =01&remove=018 or =01&unsubscribe=018 rate that is practi=
cally not=20
measurable. In fact, it=01,s less than one thousandth of one percent monthl=
y!

After some soul searching, I feel that a few of these offers are so good th=
at=20
they would be of interest to you and contribute to my goal of keeping you=
=20
active in diving.  So, I=01,m going to try this for a while by including no=
 more=20
than one promo item per month, clearly labeled as The Product of the Month.=
=20
And, you have my promise that you=01,ll only see the best of the best or yo=
u won=01,
t see anything at all. I know a few of you will find this a bit mercenary, =
as=20
I have always tried to keep the commercialism to a minimum.  If I get carri=
ed=20
away, don=01,t hesitate to let me know.

Thanks to all of you who responded to the requested feedback about the=20
Adventures In Diving Program.  Here=01,s what just a few of you had to say:

Hello, I just completed my advanced open water course, and I loved it.  I g=
o=20
through Advanced Aquatic in St. Clair Shores, Michigan and our instructor i=
s=20
Mark Kistner.  He is great, he really motivates you.  For my deep dive, he=
=20
suggested that I go up to the straights of Mackinaw, and that there was a=
=20
group going in 2 weeks.
Kathy from Roseville, MI

We did our course through the Waikato Dive Centre and really enjoyed it.  I=
'm=20
hoping to get my photos from my photography specialty tomorrow and hope the=
y=20
turn out.
Thanks PADI.
Vicki from New Zealand

I've recently completed AOW as well as the photography, deep, wreck, and=20
naturalist specialties. Being a relatively new diver (OW certified last=20
spring) I've found that the AOW class and the specialties offer a great=20
opportunity to expand my skills.
Ron from Seattle, WA

Kathy, Vicki, Ron and about 200 other PADI Divers received a new Cordura Lo=
g=20
Binder for helping us with that feedback.  Thank you all and stay tuned for=
=20
more Dear Fellow Diver surveys.
