JR,  Mr. Kirst is fine.  Please ask him to speak with Kevin Kuehler, Director 
of E&C of HPL, at 713-571-3148 or if he isn't available, Gene Peabody, 
Project Manager, at 713-571-3153.  I would think he should start either this 
pm or tomorrow.

Gerald,  we do not have a PSA with S&B Engineers; we either need to prepare 
one or utilize Mr. Kirst for this short term need based on the rate below and 
an invoice at the end of the assignment.  Please coordinate with Kevin.

Thanks,

Nick
