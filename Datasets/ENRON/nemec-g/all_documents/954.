What would you say if someone told you there is a way to conduct a meeting 
with a group of people around the world without leaving your desk or even 
picking up the phone?

How?  Simple:  eMeet.  For details on how to get together with your 
colleagues for a focused discussion in eMeet, send an email to 
ethink@enron.com.  You've simply got to start meeting like this.
