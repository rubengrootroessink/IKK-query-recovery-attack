Gerald-

Per our conversation.  I have also told Ken verbally that he is not to send 
the LLC agreement.

Thanks,

Audrey

Audrey,

I have written up a few items of the BLM application as requested by
Cordilleran - see the attached file.  I need to discuss these items with
you.

1.  Do we really need a separate unanimous consent document to go with this?
2.  The application requests to disclose the cost of the items - I am as
vague as possible.
3.  Supplemental page requires submittal (for file) a copy of the articles
of incorporation, bylaws (which for us means the LLC Operating Agreement).
Is this something everyone is aware of and ok with?  Talking to Craig, there
is no way around it.

Let's discuss today and maybe need to get Gerald's opinion.

I also sent you a copy of some mark-ups to the POD yesterday.  Any comments?
Discussed with Craig and Diane at Cordilleran this morning.  Moving ahead
with some of the changes.  Still need some info from BCCK.


Ken
