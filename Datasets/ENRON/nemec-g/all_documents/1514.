The following is a brief summary of the status of our current SCADA 
capabilities on the Lost Creek pipeline:

 Madden West
MDS Radio installed and functioning properly
polling pressure and flow data correctly
chromatograph appears to be functioning correctly
setpoint capabilities have not yet been tested.  We will need to have a field 
operator present on-site before performing this test.
EFM data collection is being configured to correspond to ROCLINK, rather than 
our standard Enron MODBUS load, that is installed on the ROC
polling H2S and H2O levels, but correct registers have not been verified yet

Fred Novotny
MDS radio installed and functioning properly
polling pressure and flow data correctly
chromatograph appears to be functioning correctly
setpoint capabilities have not yet been tested.  We will need to have a field 
operator present on-site before performing this test
EFM data collection is being configured to correspond to ROCLINK, rather than 
our standard Enron MODBUS load, that is installed on the ROC
polling H2S and H2O levels, but correct registers have not been verified yet

Keith Baker
MDS radio installed and was functioning properly
lost communications with this site yesterday.  Elkhorn has been notified and 
will have someone onsite today to inspect the ROC and comm package.  In 
addition, I requested that the dispatched person take a laptop along to 
assist our IT group in confirming the register configuration on the RTU so 
that we can verify that we have correct H2S and H2O level readings at all of 
our meters.
setpoint capabilities have not been tested.  We will need to have a field 
operator present on-site before perfoming this test
EFM data collection is being configured to correspond to ROCLINK, rather than 
our standard Enron MODBUS load, that is installed on the ROC

Lysite Production Office
MDS master radio and omnidirectional antenna installed and functioning 
properly
UPS system installed
POTS service to Paneltec installed and functioning
CDPD service on hold awaiting decisions regarding 20/20

Lost Creek Plant Inlet
POTS service to ROC installed and functioning
polling pressure and flow data correctly
chromatograph appears to be functioning properly
setpoint capabilities have not been tested.  This ROC controls inlet flow by 
modifying suction pressure on the C-101 compressor unit, so it appears that 
it must be tested with the unit operating and personnel on-site

Lost Creek Plant Delta V
Developing screens for Gas Control to view plant operations
Have not installed Paneltec and RS-232 cable to enable polling at this time

CIG/WIC Interconnect Meters
CIG/WIC Access agreement has gone through Enron legal, but is being reviewed 
by Insurance at this time
Once this has been approved, we have to have CIG/WIC agree to the new 
document to grant us access to the site
Will have to construct new RTU building and install power, UPS, RTU, MDS 
radio and antenna at site to enable polling

Lost Creek Plant Aux Control Bldg.
Have not moved primary polling of all devices into the Aux. Control Bldg.
Awaiting 20/20 decisions to determine routing and place order for 56K 
dedicated line to site
Once clearance is granted, we will need to order and install a xyplex and hub 
in building.
Assuming that we go with CDPD coverage at the north end of the system, this 
will serve as the collation point for all incoming/outgoing SCADA traffic via 
the 56K line
Tower and antenna to be installed on site to enable polling of the CIG/WIC RTU

Sand Draw
We have good cellular coverage at this site, and wish to use cellular service 
to poll this RTU
Because RTU is in a Class 1, Div. 2 area, trying to locate a compliant 
cellular package or go with cellular package capable of operating under WY 
winter and summer temperature conditions that can be installed external to 
the meter building

Beaver Creek
This site is on hold with regard to SCADA polling at this time
