This is something I did 6 months ago to describe the major parts of the 
permitting process.

The Storage Permit time cycle is not guaranteed and can be lengthened if 
objections from the public are received. We have good relations with the 
local area and do not expect objections unless they come from competitors.
The procedure is as follows:
a. Submit application to commission.
b. Department of Natural Resources reviews application. (2-3 days minimum)
c. Public notice issued for public comment. (10 days minimum)
d. Public hearing is conducted.
e. Post hearing public comment period. (1 week minimum period dependent upon 
comments received)
f. The commission will review the hearing record and respond to comments. (1 
week minimum period dependent upon comments received)
g. Notice is sent to the La. State House and Senate Natural Resources 
Committees for comment. They have 2 weeks to respond. If there is any major 
public opposition to the application, the legislature committees can be 
expected to become involved, otherwise the usual response is "no comment".
h. With no negative responses in item g above, the commission will issue the 
permit. (1 day minimum depending upon the availability of the Commissioner 
for signature). Interesting note, the commission is not required to abide by 
any finding of the legislative committees.
