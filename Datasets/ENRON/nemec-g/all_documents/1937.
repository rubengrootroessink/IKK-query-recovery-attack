Hi again Gerald,
Going great here... keeping busy.
Worked for the month of October doing Halloween makeup
for 'Spooky House' a Halloween haunt.. FUN!
But was I ready for Halloween to be over!

Spain.. What's with that lately?  You are the 4th
person I know that's gone there in the past month.
The guy I met in Cabo just went... and Shannon's
neighbor.  Must be a fun place!

Very smooth move... Cabo in December! alright!
I loved it down there!  Ready to go again!
I am not sure if I'll go this year or try to book my
time somewhere I haven't been. I really would like to
see Aruba or Figi.

My next trip will be to Michigan for Xmas.
Always good to see the family :)

Well... catch ya later!
Marsha
