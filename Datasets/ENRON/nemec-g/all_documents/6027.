Gerald, FYI I understand that Exxon/Mobil is paying its 1st year summer
clerks
$7,500 per month and that Compaq is paying $30 per hour. Thanks, Bruce.

Bruce,

Enron North America Corp.  selected 4 candidates for interview for
summer
clerkship positions from the resumes you forward.  Two were made offers
with both accepting the offers.  The two clerks we have working this
summer
are:

Alisha Mahabir - South Texas College of Law
Nabil Nachawati - University of Houston Law Center

Nabil will be working the 1st half of the summer and Alisha will be
working
the 2nd half of the summer.  Thanks for all your help with this process.
If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to call me
