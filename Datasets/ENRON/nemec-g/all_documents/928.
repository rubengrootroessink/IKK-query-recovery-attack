I believe the referenced meeting is still scheduled for Wedns @ 10 am at a 
location TBD; (i included you on Nick's previous e-mail).

Shonnie was "up to speed" with our discussions in that you are going to 
prepare a letter for the Crescendo Managing Members that allowed me the 
capability to proceed with gathering negotiations on Crescendo's behalf.

After that was accepted, you & I were going to prepare a letter to Wildhorse 
alerting them of our acquisition of the Enogex properties (along with the 
contract), our intentions, and our "assumption" that they would abide by the 
contract.

We can talk more about this last part on Tues. nite &/or Wedns morning.

Thanks.

P.S.  Bierbach and Whitt are delayed until Wedns, therefore its you & I on 
Tues. nite.  My plan was to take a cab directly to a restaurant of your 
choice.  I can call you when I arrive at IAH.
