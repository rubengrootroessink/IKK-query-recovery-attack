GT,  

Looks like I will be hitting town on Saturday morning.  Eric and his wife 
will be with me.   We will come by your house in the morning, probably around 
10 am or so to group up.  Let me know if everything is still a go for you 
this weekend.  I will probably need directions to your house again.  I don't 
remember how to get there from the last time.
