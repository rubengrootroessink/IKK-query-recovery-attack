MG,

Considering all of the mustard gas bombs you were dropping last weekend at 
the wedding reception, I'm not as worried about your body odor as compared to 
your ass disorder.  I plan on packing light as well. The adaptor is good 
because Gerald takes about 15 minutes every morning and night blow drying his 
hair.  I think we can get our stuff laundered at most of the hotels or they 
can point us the way to a Laundromat.  My only advice on packing is bring 2 
pair of comfortable shoes.

Peeps-

Is there anything that we need to do to prepare for the Crutial Clutch Cargo
Gig that's about to occur?  FYI - I have an electricity adapter already, so
you won't need one if you don't already have one.  Jen, do you have any idea
what laundry facilities will be like?  I'd like to take the least amount of
clothing as possible to avoid having much luggage . . . but, I don't want to
stink for a week either.
