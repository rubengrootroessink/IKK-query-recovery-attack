________________________________
Fri, June 29 - Wed, July 4??  Cozumel
This trip is limited to 20 divers (unlimited  non-divers are welcome).? We 
depart Friday evening (no need to miss work)  or you can meet us in Cozumel 
on Saturday, June 30.? We start diving on  Saturday and don't stop until 
Tuesday afternoon.? Diving will be a la carte  with Yellow Rose Divers (you 
choose your own package of either 3 or 5 dives each  day.)? I'm still 
finalizing the hotel in Cozumel, but it will be either  Hotel Bahia or Casa 
Mexicana.? Both are in town for maximum convenience to  dive sites and 
restaurants.
?
Package costs to be finalized by the end of the  week.? A $200 deposit will 
be required for the hotel/dive portion of the  trip.? Another $100 deposit 
will be required if you want to take advantage  of the group airfare.
?
Airfare:? I currently have only 10 group seats  reserved because it's not the 
most direct route.? (I can add more spots if  necessary) You can opt to 
partake in this adventure ($495) or take the higher  priced ($790+) direct 
flight into Cozumel.? We're flying into Cancun,  transferring by motor coach 
to Playa del Carmen.? Overnight in Playa at the  Hotel Molcas, then taking 
the ferry across the water to Cozumel in the  morning.? Yellow Rose will meet 
us at the pier and transfer our luggage to  the hotel.? We'll be within 
walking distance or we can cab over to our  hotel.? We'll be in the water and 
have completed the first dive before the  direct flight from Houston arrives 
that morning.
?
On the return, we don't leave until Wednesday  evening.? We can return to 
Playa del Carmen by ferry at any time thoughout  the day, and transfer by 
motorcoach back to Cancun.? I'll have the schedule  for all this shortly.
________________________________
Sat, July 28 - Sat, Aug 4?? Costa  Rica
I have 10 spots reserved but can easily double  that.? This trip includes 
four dive days with Bill Beard, horseback riding  through the nature reserve, 
white water rafting, tree top canopy tours and 2  nights at the Arenal 
volcano at a hot springs resort.? This is a fantastic  trip for non-divers!
?
Airfare:? 10 spots from Dallas to Liberia,  Costa Rica on Champion Air for 
$450.? Direct flights from Houston go into  San Jose, which require an extra 
2-4 hours by bus to get to the resort and is  currently running $785.? It's 
easier to do the extra travel between Houston  and Dallas rather than in 
Costa Rica where the roads can be very poor.?  
?
Package costs to be finalized by the end of the  week.? A $200 deposit will 
be required for the hotel/dive/adventure portion  of the trip.? Another $100 
deposit will be required if you want to take  advantage of the group airfare.
