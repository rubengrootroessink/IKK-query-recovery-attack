Thanks for your call this morning.  If you want to email back the
response to my questions relative to confirmations and invoicing, that's
OK with me.  I recommend the invoicing issue (Enron paying Citation
based on receiving that information directly from Bear Paw or other
metering entity) be handled in the Transactions as that supercedes the
Enfolil Agreement.  Any questions, please advise.
