Subject: EPC/OE Contracts

Not much luck thus far.  Both of my pipeline/process contracting guys are 
gone for the day.  I'll talked to them on Monday.  In the meantime, attached 
are sample forms for the following:

1.  Owner's Engineer Agreement (this form was put together for the Vitro 
power project but the type of project won't really make a difference in most 
respects)

2.  EPC Term Sheet (this form was taken from the RioGen power project so some 
of the terms will probably not be applicable such as performance LD 
provisions)

I can send you an EPC contract go-by for power projects but I think many of 
the provisions will be overkill or otherwise not applicable.  Let me know if 
you want it, otherwise, I'll see what I can find on Monday re an EPC contract 
(and EPC termsheet) for pipeline/process projects.

Regards.

Scott
