Yes,  I am alive.  Got in a little late, but still here nonetheless.  Deblah 
who?

I am checking to see if anybody is up for tonight and I should know later 
this afternoon.  I know we really need to have more drinks, its been so long.

Yes, I was serious about China.  Talked to Eric this morning and they would 
leave on June 6 and return on June 16.  I need to make sure this works with 
my work schedule.  I think it would be really cool to see Bejing, the Great 
Wall, etc............... and hone my skills as Show Lin High Priest Martial 
Arts badass......

Hey there!

Just wanted to see if you got to work okay!  Guess who was up in our studios
this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jenn
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be so
much fun.  Now you're sitting there saying, "crap, why did I bring that
up...I was just kidding around!"
