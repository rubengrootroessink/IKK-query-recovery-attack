Trailblazer received their FERC approval on Wednesday of last week.  
Trailblazer is sending me ENA's assignment letter.  Equally, they will be 
sending Huber's assignment to Brian Stone.

It looks like the bids will be rolled into two separate contracts one 
eleven-year and one ten-year.

Call if you have questions / concerns.
