Pat,  As you probably guessed, I won't be able to make it on the trip.  
Sounds like fun, but work schedule and funds availability wouldn't allow for 
it. Sorry to be so delinquent in getting back to you.  I appreciate the 
invite and lets keep in touch.   Are you keeping Mark in line these days?

My dear compadres,

We are a month away from our trip to the beautiful Lake Tahoe.  Here is the
link to the house we have reserved.
As a repeat offender, we get a price break and it is going to be $198.00
for the house from March 8th to the 13th for ten people.
