Gerald, I have discussed the papering of this transaction with SPPC and NPC 
and we will proceed with the raising of a Master Firm agreement between ENA 
and each of these co's. 

This specific sale will be papered under Nevada Power Co. so let's proceed 
with that paper being the lead.

I will review the confirm you sent, but re-issue under the premise that the 
confirm is being raised to the new master. 

Thanks.  BT
