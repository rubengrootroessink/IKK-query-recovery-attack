Hi Gerald. I am SO sorry that I haven't returned your telephone call yet.
Things have been very hectic over the past couple of days here. I am leaving
for Brazil for a week or so on Sunday (just found out yesterday) and have
been trying to get everything in order. Thanks for the invite for tonight --
I am actually going out of town this afternoon (to Austin to see my cousin's
new baby!), so I won't be able to grab a drink. I hope you had a great time
in Spain and a good Thanksgiving! Talk to you soon. MB

Hi MB,

Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see
if you would want to meet for a drink after work today?
