Yo Pa:

They're just whining. It means nothing. I'm glad Bush Jr. didn't sell the
Aegis boats to Taiwan yet; if he had the Butchers of Beijing would have
raised a big stink. The common people read the newspapers, drink their tea,
and complain a little, but they won't raise the topic with a foreigner they
don't know personally. Remember- Sun Tze wrote the "Art of War" 2500 years
ago. We're doing exactly what the Chinese would do if they were able to, and
they understand this.

If the PLA weren't so stupid and belligerent a majority of the Taiwanese
would probably agree to a slowly enacted "One Country-Two Systems"
arrangement like Hong Kong and Macau. Unfortunately, the PLA adds 50 missles
every year on the Fujian coast aimed at Taiwan, and ceaselessly threatens
the Taiwanese. Also, the continued antagonism between the Kuomingtang (Chang
Kai Shek's KMT) and the commies doesn't help. Taiwan's economy is developed
and robust, a "little dragon" of East Asia; while the mainland still has 900
million peasants wiping their asses with leaves. If you were Taiwan would
you be racing to re-join the motherland? Jiang Ze Min promised the
hardliners in 1993 when he was coming to power that he would bring Taiwan
back in to the fold. This isn't going to happen during his tenure. He's
finished in 2003, and he's bummed that the glory of a unified China won't be
ascribed to him. Sorry, chum.

This won't affect the wedding or the Chinese people's reaction to your
presence in the motherland. This is a wedding, and everything should be back
to normal by June. None of my Chinese colleagues flip me shit about it. If
they raise the topic I just say I don't formulate American foreign policy.
If they have any questions or comments they can direct them to Colin Powell.
I'm a common bloke just like them and they understand. As they say in
Alabama, "It's all gooood."

Yesterday Ai Ping and I finally reserved all the hotel rooms for everybody
in Qingdao. I've got you booked from June 8-10: three nights. You'll be on
the 29th floor in the presidential suite- you've got 170 square meters and a
great view of the ocean. The room consists of a huge living room, two
bedrooms, a kitchenette and a bathroom. I'll be living with you on June 8th,
and then move to another room on the wedding night. Eric and Jeff will be on
the same floor. This hotel was built for the PLA brass in the late 1970's,
but now caters to corporate clients who want to live and work in the same
building.

Check your plane tickets to make sure when you're arriving in Shanghai. Is
it June 5th or 6th? If you leave Minneapolis on the 5th, you'll probably be
arriving in Shanghai on the 6th. Let me know. Ai Ping's heading back to
Taiyuan tonight for some final prep work in Shanxi. Later she'll be
returning to Qingdao one more time to make final arrangements. I'm swamped
with UK, US and Australian visa prep work. Right now is crunch time for me.
The weather here is great. Should be nice and steambath-like by the time you
arrive in June. Enjoy! Dress accordingly. No wool suits! We are six weeks
and counting..... Let the chaos begin. The weak shall be punished.

Hope all is swell in Iowa. I'll be in touch again soon. Give my favorite
schnauzer a big,juicy smooch on his black nose. Zaijian.

Love, Jon
