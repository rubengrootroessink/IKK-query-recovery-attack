This is just to be helpful, not anal! Here are some suggestions for
packing. Please note that I already made up a first aid kit for us, so
don't worry about medicines, Band-Aids, etc. Yes, I know I've thought of
everything. See you manana! Chao!

Matt, everything ok inside? I have some Tums in the med kit, but no GasX.
Also, my friend Kim Evans (works at Continental)  is traveling to Italy at
the same time and is trying to work her jelly to get on our flight or
another airline with similar times. She's trying to work it to spend a day
or so in Madrid with us.
