Hi Gerald:  ENA has 2 executed agreements with a Colonial Pipeline Company in 
Atlanta, GA re 1) our possible provision of risk management, energy advisory 
and facility outsourcing services and 2) our possible provision of energy 
management services.  The more recent one (3/10/2000 for risk management, 
energy advisory . . . ) is our form.  Neither contain any unusual restrictive 
provisions.
 Kay
