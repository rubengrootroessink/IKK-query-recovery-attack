Gerald -

Here is the updated contract from Gregg.  The changes that they made were in 
section 3.02 (I believe) dealing with misc. travel costs and such.  I am 
allowing them to run up to a total of $4000 worth of travel and hotel bills 
without requiring approval from me, as I believe that that is a fair amount 
considering the physical location of their workforce and the need to 
communicate with me and with each other.  Should the misc. expenses exceed 
$4000, Gregg Engineering must confirm any such overruns with me, or they are 
not reimbursable.  In addition, I corrected a few references to sections that 
were renumbered and some grammar and spelling stuff.  Please let me know what 
you think.
