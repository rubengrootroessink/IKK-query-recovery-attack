Gerald, 

I work with Mark Knippa in Compression Services and we need your assitance 
for Gallup Project.  We just got access to a website, which monitors load.  
We need to revise the confidentiality agreement to specifically determine who 
can have access to this website.

I would appreciate it if you give me this information as soon as possible.  
You can either call me at 53269 or sen me the information via email.

Thanks.

Maria Tefel
