Peeps-

Is there anything that we need to do to prepare for the Crutial Clutch Cargo
Gig that's about to occur?  FYI - I have an electricity adapter already, so
you won't need one if you don't already have one.  Jen, do you have any idea
what laundry facilities will be like?  I'd like to take the least amount of
clothing as possible to avoid having much luggage . . . but, I don't want to
stink for a week either.
