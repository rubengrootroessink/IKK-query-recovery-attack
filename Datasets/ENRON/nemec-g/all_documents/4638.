Terri,

The draft guidelines for the test protocol that Ozzie Pagan requested are 
attached below. We probably ought to review them with Jerry Campbell after 
you review them to see if he can accept them in his O&M Agreement.

This is just a starting point for wording in the Agreement. There is no 
"pride of authorship" here!
