Shonnie and Gerald,

I wanted  to get back to you on your request regarding using our due 
diligence report for your schedule on Title.   

I have reviewed the full report and talked with the Global representative who 
prepared it and I have concerns about the state of the easement/license 
activity and am not inclined to provide the report to you for use as a 
schedule.    I'm working on language to include in the PSA as necessary to 
protect Northern Border in this regard.  I will forward to you when 
available.
