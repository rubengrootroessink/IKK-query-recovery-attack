This is the memo I wrote.  It is lengthy, so you could get the gist of it by 
reading the brief answer and conclusion where I recap the substance of the 
memo.  If there are any changes that you want me to make or anything that you 
would like me to add, let me know.  I'll stop by tomorrow to make the 
necessary changes and additions.
