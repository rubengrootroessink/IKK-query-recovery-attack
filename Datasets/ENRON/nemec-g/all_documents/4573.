Gentlemen:

Could you please advise as to the status of executing these assignments.  I
prepared and delivered duplicate originals of each to Jerry Padilla of
Sandia Resources prior to the Christmas holiday, and it is my understanding
that he has forwarded them to you for execution.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Alan Bransgrove
