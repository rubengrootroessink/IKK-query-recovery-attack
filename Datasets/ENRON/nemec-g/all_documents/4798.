Subject: Assignment Language Edits Permissable to Kern's TSA




Stephanie, 
The following language has been approved by our attorney as an acceptable 
substitute to the related dentence in the existing TSA. Call me if you have 
any questions.

No permitted assignment shall relieve the assigning party from any of its 
obligations under this Agreement that existed prior to, or which arise out of 
circumstances occurring prior to, such assignment.
