I sm preparing to open up a bidding activity for the subject Pipeline which 
is approximately four miles of 12" pipe under account # 3224.  The nbv is 
$18,901.

I have dusted off my list of salvage bidders and under separate cover will 
publish these seeking additions or deletions from any of you who care to 
contribute.  ;I am assuming that this pipe is not viably operating and would 
appreciate any information in this regard if I am incorrect.  

As for now, I would like a sample Purchase and Sale Agreement and a 
Confidentiality Agreement that I may use with my solicitations.  This would 
include some type of alignment sheet depicting the pipe and its legal 
description, etc.  You are all seasoned in knowing what level of data I need 
at this stage of the offer.

I already have at least one interested party in this and would like to move 
forward as soon as possible to get this on the table for bids.  I would 
appreciate receiving the necessary materials by October 31, or information of 
how I can contribute to this activity.  Also, please let me know if there is 
someone else I should copy on this.

Thank you in advance for your assistance in this endeavor.
