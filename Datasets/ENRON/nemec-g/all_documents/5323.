Got your message on the work e-mail, but then decided to get that out of my
system.  Don't want anyone at corporate reading how I was in your bed last
night. Ha!  I am glad that you are recognizing exactly how cool I actually
am!  (Bad grammar on that line).

Miss Barbara is doing good today.  It has been a semi-slow day.  Kind of
working at my own pace and not feeling in a rush to have anything completed.
It has actually been kind of nice not to be on a time crunch.  Went out to
lunch with Renee and just got back a little bit ago.  I think that she was a
little upset with me.  Her boss was asking me what I was doing for lunch and
I told her that I was going with Renee.  She think looked like a sad puppy
dog wanting to go with us and I invited her...Renee was not real happy with
that move.  Oh well, it was good to catch up with someone new.

Sounds like you are about to loose it at work...you are quoting movie lines
again.  Sorry to hear that you are so busy.  Does this mean that you will be
putting in some extra hours this week?  When does the guy your helping out
get back from skiing?

Hope you get a little relief from work soon....have fun!
