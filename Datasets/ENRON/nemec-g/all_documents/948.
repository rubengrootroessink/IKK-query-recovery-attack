Jim Osborne expects to take delivery of 37 boxes of San Arroyo well files 
from Enogex by mid-week, next week.  He is moving into new offices about the 
same time, approx. Tuesday, July 18th.
I asked him to survey the data and give us a call ASAP re: what is included 
in the files/data.  At that point, we can determine if we need to go to 
Midland to review, or have him send the pertinent files to us in Houston.
As of now, no decision back from Wild Horse re: dew point solution.
Wells currently producing approx. 1.6 mmcfd because of higher than normal 
line pressures which are the result of the dew point problem and re-routing 
of the gas from the San Arroyo Plant (Wild Horse).

FYI, their new address and info.
