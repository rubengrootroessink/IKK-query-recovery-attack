Hello,

I work in Applications Integration on the GEM Project (Windows 2000 
rollout).  It is our mission to ensure that all applications are tested and 
packaged for use with Windows 2000 so that the Enron user community can be 
migrated to Windows 2000.  I am contacting you because we have identified the 
current version of HTS32 as not compatible with Windows 2000 and I found your 
name in the application group as one of the users of this application.

I need your help in gathering the following information:

Who is the "owner" of this application (the person who can tell me if it is 
still needed)?

Is it still used?

Has it been replaced by another application or a web based application?  If 
so, when and which application?


If it is still used:

Vendor (or developer) name?  (please include any contact info. you may have: 
web site, contact, phone number).

Who can work with me to obtain the new version (if needed) and test it?

Who uses it (if this list is too large, just note the approximate number of 
people)?

Do you foresee that this application will go away in the next couple of 
months? 

Is your maintenance contract up-to-date?


Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

Howard Petty
