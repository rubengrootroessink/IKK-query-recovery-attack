Dear U2 Fan,


With this e-mail comes the first in a series of unique e-cards for
you from U2.

The card lets you know about exclusive MP3 downloads from the new U2 album
All That You Can't Leave Behind which you will find on U2.com.  You might
even find a little surprise hidden inside the card if you key in the right
code (which may be easier to find than you think!)

Fans who have registered with us at U2.com will be the first to know of all
the latest news from U2. Why not send this e-card onto friends who are also
into the band.

Stay in touch


Best wishes
