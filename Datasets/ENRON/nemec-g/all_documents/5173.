Ever wonder what happens to the ideas in the Idea Vault?  The possibilities 
are almost endless, but here is how your idea might be "discovered":
Putting your idea in the Idea Vault gets it in front of everyone at Enron.  
You might make a connection with someone on the other side of the world who 
is working on a similar concept.  
The eThink team checks regularly, and, when we know who might be able to 
help, we route ideas to various people at Enron.  
Various business groups check the Idea Vault in their weekly staff meetings 
to see if Enron's next big initiative is waiting there.
The Enron Xcelerator is looking for fresh business initiatives, and they 
might find some in the Idea Vault.
