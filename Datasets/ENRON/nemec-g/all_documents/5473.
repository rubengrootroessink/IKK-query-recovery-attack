Gerald,
In response to AEC proposals and the sections with potential credit impact, 
please see below.

Subsection 4.2(ix)-  I will need to speak to their credit about this, but 
given the size of AEC in comparison to Enron, these amounts should remain as 
originally drafted.

Subsection 4.2(x)- This seems more a legal issue than credit issue, let me 
know your thoughts.

Section 4.6- I am OK with five business days.

Thanks
Russell

Per the attached cover letter explaining AEC's requested changes, I attach
