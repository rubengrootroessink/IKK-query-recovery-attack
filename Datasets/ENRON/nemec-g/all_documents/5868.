Here is the clean version, with spacing, numbering and punctuation fixed.
On the Master Netting Agreement Amendment, one more change - the signature
block for PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. should be by PG&E Energy Trading
Holdings Corporation (there is no longer a "-Power" in its name).  We
chagnedits name in the last few months.

The UCC searches are in process.  CEG is a Saskatchewan corp and ET Gas
Canada is an Alberta-headquartered corp.  The other three are Maryland based
so their searches should move faster.  Peter
