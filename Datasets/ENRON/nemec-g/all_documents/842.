I am going to a farewell party for Mike Vigeant tonight.  He is leaving 
Enron.   Did you know Mike?  He worked in various groups and is currently in 
EBS.   I am open for Sat. and Sun.  Maybe we could hook up Sat.  I will give 
you a call on Saturday.  See ya.

Well, I've made the executive decision to bring a BIG suitcase rather than 
the backpack.  So I'm planning on filling it up with lot's of shi-shi girl 
things for any and all occasions.  Seriously, Saturday is crazy -- lot's of 
errands.  I probably won't worry about packing until Wednesday night and then 
I'm leaving the office around 1:00 on Thursday.  

What are you doing this weekend?  I'm sure a few of us will get together for 
drinks or something but nothing is concrete at this point.  Maybe we can hook 
up somewhere.

It is getting very close to departure time.  Are you organized for your trip 
yet?  I know you really only have to pack about 5 thongs and you're done.
