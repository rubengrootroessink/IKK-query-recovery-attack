Gerald - attached below is a P.A. for an open season we participated in off 
Williams Gas Pipeline.  I doubt that we will actually take capacity; however, 
Williams is allowing a management out.  Therefore, it represents a free 
option.  Please review and work your magic.

Mark - I've also attached Williams presentation on the project for your use 
(if any).

Thanks
