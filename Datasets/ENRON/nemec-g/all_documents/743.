Gerald,


Please let me know the status of the Oasis Pipe Line Company contracts 
regarding the assignment from Enron North America Corp. to Houston Pipe Line 
Company.  I have received several amendments to these contracts.  I will not 
route the amendments for signature if the assignment will take place.


Thank you.


Marlene Hilliard
