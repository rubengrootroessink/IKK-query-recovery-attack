Well, as I recall from the other night...I asked you all to consider me for
the band one more time and there seemed to be a bunch of hem and hawing.  In
my negotiations with Quiet Riot, I have discovered that I am a hot commodity
and many bands will be seeking me for their lead singer position.  I have
even heard that more recent bands (I cannot give out those names at this
time) have even considered asking their current lead singers to step down to
a back up singer position.

I am sorry that our relationship has deteriorated over this one incident.  I
tried to be fair from the beginning...but you all wanted to make sure that
you created an all boys band.  However, I am still hoping that we can resolve
this issue.  I cannot say that my asking price will be the same, given my
recent brush with fame.  Sometimes in life we make the wrong decision and I
am hoping that Monkey Pump will not make a mistake here.  However, if Monkey
Pump decides not to give me the chance to increase their potential of
success, I promise to still appear on VH1 and I promise to not say anything
about the band.
