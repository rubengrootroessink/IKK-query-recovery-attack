Gerald,

I need to have an exhibit prepared, showing the specifics of the deal we have 
with Greely Gas for the upcoming summer.  The attachment below highlights all 
the deal parameters.  Greely is in the process of reviewing the master firm 
agreement and would like to sign this exhibit at the same time.  Please call 
me if you have any questions.  Thanks again for all your help.  

Paul

PS.  Has Dave found a wife on the internet yet, I've found a few girls there 
I'd marry.
