Hi Gerald,

Our last night in Cabo was actually very low key.  We did end up going to the 
Giggling Marlin and guess what???  I was called up to do the whole dance 
thing!  And luckily I was paired with a tall man ( who's girlfriend was in 
the audience... ) and we actually did pretty good together.  And what was 
even funnier was that I ended up dancing with a "little Amigo" all night.  He 
was about 4 foot 2 inches tall!  Barely came up to my chest and he was loving 
it!  And I was okay with all of it as it kept me safe!  I did not have you 
there to ward off all the weirdo's!!!  But we did have fun...

Good to hear that you made it back in one piece.  The plane ride back was fun 
as we had the back of the airplane to ourselves so we just sat in the back 
and giggled about everything that happen on our trip!  We have great memories 
and I feel very fortunate to have met you the first night!  You and I must 
have had good karma to meet up like we did...

I too am just a tad bit slammed!  Luckily my support checked my e-mail and 
mail so I am not too buried in paperwork!  I just need to check my voice mail 
and then pick up where I left off a week ago!!!   The only surprise that I 
came back to was my counter part ( I do Non Medical contracts and Derek does 
Medical contracts ) has decided to move to Portland with his wife, thus he 
will be leaving GHC at the end of this month.  Which leaves just me for all 
of the contracts.  Which is not a big deal as I have already been through 
this twice before.  Makes for long hours but that is the way that it goes!

Off to one more meeting for today...Have a great day and I will talk to you 
soon...

Dee

Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back
without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality
baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me.

What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did
your partners meet any new family members?

I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much
more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when
you get a chance and let me know how you are.

Take care,
Gerald.
