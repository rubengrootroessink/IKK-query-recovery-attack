Gerald, let's produce a document for Mexicana that they can send to their 
supplier(s) that formaly appoints Enron as the agent for invoice, nominations 
and day to day logistics. 

Set this document up as a standard form on non-Enron letterhead and we can 
forward to them to use with their supply.

call if any questions.
