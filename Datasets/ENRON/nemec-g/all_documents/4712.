Thank you for choosing Time Warner Road Runner as your high speed online
provider.  Your request has been received and it is currently being processed.
A customer service professional will be in contact with you within 48 hours.
While you wait, here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.

Q. If I am already a Road Runner customer what will happen to my account?

A. Your account will be transitioned to the new Enron billing system.  This
process is transparent to the end user.  The difference will be seen in your
monthly bill.  Keep in mind that there may still be prorated amount due on the
previous billing method.  Also, an account that is currently delinquent cannot
be transferred until the previous balance is paid in full.

Q. I?m not currently a Road Runner customer.  What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability.  If
serviceable, a customer service professional will contact you to set up an
appointment for a new install.  There are typically two time slot options a
customer may choose, 8am ? 12 noon or 1pm ? 5pm.

Q. Are there any installation charges?

A. All Enron customers will be charged a fee of $39.95 for a standard install
(network interface card not included).  Keep in mind that if you are getting
your computer through the Click at Home project, a network interface card is
already included.  A standard install is one that only required the installer 
to
run the cable to an outside wall.  There are extra fees for a network 
interface
card and running the cable between an inside wall.
