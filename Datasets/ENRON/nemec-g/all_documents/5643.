Will you help me decorate an egg? 

By the way, have you seen my watch laying around your house?? I am thinking 
that I left it over there Sunday night. 

Thanks

Okay, we have decided to have an EASTER EGG decorating contest! 
You decorate your own egg - don't go buy a decorated one! 
Judging will be at the BBQ & prizes will be won ... 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 
honors! 

So, be creative!
