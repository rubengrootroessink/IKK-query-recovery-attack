I have a draft agreement between ENA and an Intergen North America L.P. (very 
likely the same as you Intergen Energy) re ENA's possible sale of potential 
electric generation project sites located in Tennessee, Mississippi, 
Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky to InterGen.  dated 12/13/99.  I don't know 
that it was every executed.  Ed Hearn prepared it for someone in the power 
group. 

Other than that, I don't find anythin with or relating to Intergen North 
America.
