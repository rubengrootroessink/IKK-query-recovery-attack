No.  In fact, Gulf has been asked by AEC to join them in a meeting with
WFEC.  Is there any problem from your perspective with Gulf participating in
such a meeting?  Now that our joint petition for declaratory statement has
been filed, Gulf has agreed to attend such a meeting which is in the process
of being set up for sometime in the next 7 to 10 days.  Of course, we intend
to hold to the position stated in the joint petition and assume that you
would as well.
