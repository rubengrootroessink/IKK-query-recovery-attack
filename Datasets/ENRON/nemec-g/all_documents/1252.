> A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client.  He was told the

> dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.

> "Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we

> "Your letter regarding title in Case 189156 has been received.  I note

> Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher
> Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to
> India by then reigning monarch, Isabella.  The good queen, being a pious

> accepted, created this world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume
> that He also made that part of the world called Louisiana.
> He, therefore, would be the owner of origin.  I hope to hell you find His
> original claim to be satisfactory.  Now, may we have our damn
> loan?"
