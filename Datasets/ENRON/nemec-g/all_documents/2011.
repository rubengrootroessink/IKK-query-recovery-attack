Just FYI.  I got a call from Liz Orr [Wildhorse] who said per her acctg group 
we have been flowing around 2,700 mcf/d for October and November.   Per the 
production spreadsheet from Jim/Dan, the production has been around 3,000 
mcf/d +/- 50 mcf/d for both months.  This is the same as 3,200 mmbtu/d [Btu 
factor is 1.06 to 1.07].  Our nom on Wildhorse has been 3200 mmbtu/d.

I just found out that our nom on Wildhorse s/b in mcfs, not in mmbtus.  So, 
that will confuse matters.  Per Wildhorse we have an imbalance of 500 per day 
[3,200 mcf/d nom vs actuals of 2,700 mcf/d] - 16,000 for Oct.  Thus, per 
Wildhorse, we need to reduce the nom to around 2,200 mcf/d in order to come 
back in line.   The concern with reducing the nom should not affect the VPP 
volumes, but it will affect the excess volume [pricing] because for the month 
of November, Paul Lucci has sold the 3,200 mmbtu/d as baseload.  Stacy Brewer 
[ENA scheduler] will discuss with Paul.  Thus, if we reduce our nom, it will 
affect his baseload market and he will have to go out and buy gas in order to 
keep his market whole, and prices have gone up mid month.  [Mark Whitt - I 
know this is mixing mcfs and mmbtus and in reality it's not as simply stated 
as above].

In discussions with Jim, Dan Reineke [sp?] will get Wildhorse's actuals from 
their acctg group, then he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come 
up with the final actual numbers.  Apparently that will take him about a 
day.  So, we need to wait til actuals get reconciled in order to figure out 
what our imbalance is.  We do need to reduce our nom from 3,200 mcf/d to 
3,000 mcf/d, but Liz said to hold off on that for now.

Per disc with Jim Osborne and Liz Orr, 11/15 pm.

hey,

per my ops guy, he will get wildhorse's actuals from their acctg group, then 
he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come up with the final actual 
numbers.  apparently that will take him about a day.  he still says we flowed 
3,000 mcf/d +/- 50 mcf/d for both months.  i suppose we will know more 
tomorrow.  

i left liz a voicemail stating the above.

just spoke with liz. first of all, our noms s/b in mcf, not in mmbtu.  so, we 
s/b noming around 3,000 mcf/d on wildhorse.  i'm not sure how you transfer 
from mcf to mmbtu in selling it for paul.  you know what i mean?  so, i 
suppose we need to reduce the wildhorse nom from 3200 [or so] to 3000 mcf.  i 
mentioned this to liz, and she said to wait, she's going to check things 
out.  i also told her my operations people insist that the production is and 
has been around 3000 mcf [not 2700].  she again said to wait and she's going 
to check with her acctg group to make sure they've got all the charts and to 
try to figure out why the discrepancy.  so, we're on hold, but i do for sure, 
foresee that you will need to lower the nom to 3000 mcf, but this is the same 
as 3200 mmbtu [btu factor is 1.06 to 1.07], which should not affect paul.

just fyi. i will be out of the office next week.  
thanks.

i have 2 messages into liz - her voicemail does say she will be out for a 
couple hours today.  i spoke with our operations person, and he is saying the 
total flow has been around 3,000 mcf/d, and using mmbtu it's higher.  so, he 
has no idea where she's getting that 2700 mmbtu/d number.  i have calls into 
her to discuss.
