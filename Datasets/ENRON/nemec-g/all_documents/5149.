That sounds good but that's the day of the "Spring Jam".  Dan's band and 4
others are going to be playing at  a hole in the wall bar in Spring all
afternoon and evening and the first 4 kegs are free.  I suggest we attend
that instead.  Some of the bands in the line-up are actually pretty darn
good.  And who can beat free beer?

 NOFX deliver punk with panache


 NOFX (House of Blues; 1,000 capacity; $22.50)


 By Troy J. Augusto


 HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - If there's one band that modern punk-rock
 concert-goers can always count on for a good time, it's L.A.'s NOFX,
 whose fusion of musical influences and tightly delivered mix of humor
 and melody leaves most other bands in their dust.


 At the second of three sold-out House of Blues shows on Sunday, the
 three-chord quartet, which formed in the Bay Area in the mid-1980s,
 showed the result of years of nonstop touring by ripping through an
 action-packed hour-plus set.


 The all-ages gig featured a fan-approved selection of popular catalog
 songs (``Linoleum,'' ``Don't Call Me White,'' ``It's My Job to Keep
 Punk Rock Elite,'' ``The Brews'') from their many independently
 released albums and EPs, each generating the usual mosh-pit activities
 on the dance floor. (Venue security types were busy all night ejecting
 the rabble-rousers.)


 The set list was rounded out with a few choice cuts from last year's
 excellent ``Pack Up the Valuum'' (Epitaph) collection, like the twisted
 love tune ``Pharmacist's Daughter,'' about a guy who dates a girl so he
 can get drugs from her daddy, ``What's the Matter With Parents Today''
 and ``Louise,'' one of bassist-singer Fat Mike's many graphic tributes
 to lesbians.


 Besides the humor, band stands out from the pack with impressive vocal
 harmonies (even as they sing ``kill all the white man''), outstanding
 songwriting, and the players' aptitude on their instruments, not
 exactly a strength for most punk outfits. Four or five songs even
 boasted guitarist El Hefe blowing smooth on trumpet.


 Playful show ended with the new album's final track, ``Theme From a
 NOFX Album,'' an autobiographical party limerick with an
 ``oom-pah-pah'' flow that pretty much summed up the band's fortunes.
 ``We're professional punkers, we come from the suburbs, after 15 years
 we're still having fun.''


 Presented inhouse. Band: Fat Mike, Eric Melvin, El Hefe, Erik Ghint.
 Opened Feb. 24, 2001, reviewed Feb. 25, closed Feb. 26.
