Pls raise clean documents ( duplicates ) of all three confirms for Sierra 
Pacific. Initial them and I will send to customer with a cover letter from 
myself requesting signatures. 

If there are any questions, give me a call. 

Thanks, BT

Revised per your request.  I did remove the conditions precedent.  All outs 
in the Cinergy Trading Firm Contract have expired.  I understand that Kern 
has a final certificate from FERC.  Is this the case?

We do need to have the executed assignment docs, before we sign this paper.
