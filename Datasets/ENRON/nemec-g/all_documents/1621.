This is my recommendation (the info under the double lines below was
typed earlier than this fresh info here):

DELTA Airlines ---- this cost you guys $5.00 more than Continental, but
save me about $230 + 2 days and we have better flight times in my
opinion

You three depart Houston Intercontinental
11/17 @ 1:35 p.m.
arrive Atlanta 4:43 p.m.
depart Atlanta 5:45 p.m.
arrive Madrid 8:10 a.m. (Saturday)

I leave Des Moines INTERNATIONAL Airport
11/17 @ 11:30 a.m.
arrive Atlanta 2:45 p.m.
depart Atlanta same as you

Returning on 11/27 . . .
We all depart Madrid @ 11:35 a.m.
arrive Atlanta 3:30 p.m.
then . .
You three depart Atlanta 5:35 p.m.
arrive Houston 6:41 p.m.

I depart Atlanta 6:00 p.m.
arrive Des Moines 9:32 p.m. (via Cincinnati)

YOU THREE's record loactor # is MEW487  ($483.90 tax included)
MY record locator # is ME1XEN  ($611.90 tax included)  <--- cheaper than
paying for a flight to Houston and staying overnight

Delta = 1-800-354-9822
We can each call them and give them credit card & frequent flyer
information (they also partner with United if you have a United frequent
flyer number -- and perhaps others as well)

A return on 11/25 is available, but not 11/26.  The 11/25 return would
add $20.00 to our cost each.

Continental International = 800-231-0856

The exact prior dates are not available.
We COULD depart Friday 11/17 . . . .
and
return Friday 11/24
-or-
return Monday 11/27
but not Saturday or Sunday (both the international & domestic legs are
sold out)

On Continental we have to fly through Newark as that is their gateway
city.
Since the flight must go through Newark (I also checked Northwest via
Minneapolis and all their flights are sold out for 3 or 4 people) . . .
I could actually just meet you guys in Newark -- it would cost me
probably about $100-150 more than to fly into Houston -- but it would
save me two days; one on either side of your departure/arrival.

Let me know and I'll call back and change the dates/times, etc. if you
want.

On NOVEMBER 17th you could leave Houston @ 7:40am, 1:20 pm or 2:20 pm
and still get to Newark to meet the 8:25 pm flight to Newark.  Tell me
which you would want (I suggest 1:20 pm).  Returning you would arrive in
Newark at 1:55 p.m. and depart for Houston at 3:20 pm arriving at IAH @
7:45 pm.  Perfect.
