Gerald,

I see that these were not forwarded to you, but that Kris Johnon claims to 
have already forwarded copies of the contracts to Enron's attorney, Do you 
have these contracts already?

What is your comfort level as to the nature of these documents and your 
personal time constraints to review and negotiate?  I've been working with 
Clark Thompson and Jay Sonnenberg at Bracewell and would be happy to help get 
them involved if you think it helpful or advisable.

Please let me know.

Steve

Dwight:

Here are the contracts as submitted yesterday with the pricing change to the
Level 3 Capacity in ash handling as mentioned earlier today.  I have
forwarded a copy of the contracts to your attorney for his review as well as
a set to ReUse's attorney.  I will contact you this afternoon to make sure
you received the contracts, have any questions and see what the next steps
involve.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.
