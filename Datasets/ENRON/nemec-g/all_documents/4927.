Hey G,

Sorry not to respond until today, I was in SA yesterday.

I meant to ask you if were going for one or two nights.  Now that I see you
plan to stay only Sat night, I'll see if I can go.  Where are you/we
spending the night?

George called and left me a message that the email address on my card wasn't
working.............looks like it worked for you.

I'll talk to the wife today about going - what time on Sat were you thinking
about going?

Talk you ya,
E
