Thanks for tracking this info down.  I'll give Larry a call next week when 
I'm back. Hope all is reasonably sane at the office.

See you Monday.

		 Subject: Maps

Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company 
that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).  This 
might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your 
voice mail to Steve.

The company is Design Technics Corp.  Phone: (713) 460-2291.  The map will 
generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro 
level.
