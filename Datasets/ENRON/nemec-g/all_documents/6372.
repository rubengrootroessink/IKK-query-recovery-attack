Gerald,

I spoke with the parking department. They said to send an e-mail saying it is 
alright for me to receive subsidized parking. When you e-mail them, they also 
need the company #, and RC #. I know you are real busy, so please send the 
e-mail at your earliest convenience. In addition, if you have any more gas 
transactional work, please send it my way. Louis Allen is the person that 
needs to receive the e-mail from you. His address is louis.allen@enron.com. 
Also, they probably have my legal name, which is Nabil Nachawati. 


Thank you,

Majed
