Hopefully final comments on Rio Nogales are attached below:

Their item #1 below corrects the pipeline length of the new Rio pipeline.

I do not have a problem with item #2.  Do you have any concerns?  How about 
the word documented? 
 
Item Number 3: I assume that I will respond that the guarantee needs to be in 
our hands before we will execute.  Haden feels the work is in the $100K range 
at best.  I am asking for a corporate guarantee of $300K.  Question: I still 
want the Interconnect to read that they will reimburse us for all our 
"reasonable and documented" expenses, even if it is in excess of $300K.  
Would the guarantee limit me to $300k and I am exposed for the rest?   I 
assume a solid company would pay for the reasonable and documented amount, 
even if it was in excess of $300K.  Should I respond that we will not specify 
an amount?  I may not get the guarantee if I do not indicate an amount.   
Recommendations please.
