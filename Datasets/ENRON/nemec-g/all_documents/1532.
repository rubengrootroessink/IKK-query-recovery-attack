Glad to hear things are going o.k. I was beganing to wonder. Talked to
Sharon Saturday and she told me you have a roommate. Does he work in
Houston? What's his name and what does he do. Nosy aren't I......Ha! You
know MOM's.
     Dad and I went out to the farm to see James Sunday and we sdrove to the
lake and their fishing place. The water is really low they don't have any
water by the pier. It's dry and hot there. The grass is really dead.
            Also Tiger went to doggie heaven about a week ago. He was
getting old and feeble. He just layed down and died. We had him a long time.
James has anew puppy he is the cuties thing. Black and brown.
            All for now we love you a whole bunch.....Dad and I send our
love......MOM
