Why am I being used as a bargaining piece in this saga?  The thing that 
really scares me, is if I show up I am sure I will be selected to be on next 
years Family Reunion Committee.  Hmmm.

Okay, I guess I can make the sacrifice.  I believe I will have a 3 day 
weekend at that time.  Should work out.  I think the cocktail party on June 
23 will work out.  I have got a lot of things going on right now that would 
make it tough to get away right now for the 13th.

Talked to Mom about the flyfishing.  Sounds like they aren't sure what they 
really want to do.  They are supposed to get back to me.  You know Mom,  
avoid the things that intimidate you.  

Anyway,  hope everything is going well for you and with the wedding plans.  
Talk to you later.

Will has made the statement that he will only go if you go.  I know that is
a lot of pressure, but will you please come to the reunion?  We can drink
and polka to the oldies.  I want Will to get a taste of our past and feel
sorry for me.  So are you in?

How are the family plans for the wedding going? Are they driving you crazy?
Also, can you come to the BBQ on the 13 or the cocktail party on June 23.
Mom and Dad are coming for the BBQ.  If you want, come up then.  I want to
see you soon.  Love ya!!
