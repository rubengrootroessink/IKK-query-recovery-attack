FYI:  An e-mail from Jon and my response.

Dan: Do you know which airport we're flying into in Shanghai? 
(the new Pudong Airport or the older Hong Qiao
Airport)?

Jonny-son:

I think we'll take the plane from Shanghai and Qingdao if its only $85.00 
instead of the 22 hour train ride.
 
I think Dan is planning on taking care of the lodging in Shanghai, do you 
have any best bets or recommended places or parts of town that are better to 
stay at?  If you want you can just crash in our room to save some yuan.  I 
assume Anna won't be with you in Shanghai, or will she?
If you think it is a good idea to get the Shanghai to Qingdao flight ahead of 
time (seat availability, etc.), we should do that.  Do you need some credit 
card information to get us all booked?

Does this updated itinerary make sense: (FYI: I'm suggesting this with no 
working knowledge of anything but logic):
June 5th: Arrive in Shanghai @3:15p.m.; I assume we'll be frazzled and may 
want to rest the rest of the day & night - will require a bed & plum wine.
June 6th: Shanghai
June 7th: Shanghai
June 8th: fly to Qingdao in the morning, sightseeing?, etc.
June 9th: Wedding
June 10th: Further sightseeing in Qingdao or leave for Beijing/somewhere 
else...

Basically I'd like some guidance on how soon/late should we get to Quingdao? 
Where/What would be the best use of our sightseeing time? Are there any 
pre-wedding activities we could/need to help you with?  How long should we 
stay in Qingdao for sightseeing, etc?
We bought some travel books and I'll start getting acquainted with what 
attractions are in those areas, but I'd like your input as well.  

Sorry for all the questions, I'd call you and we could get this resolved in a 
5 minute phone call but I hear the rates are high.....Are wedding 
preparations making you freak out yet?

I RECIEVED THIS E-MAIL FROM JON THIS MORNING.

Eric:

Thanks for the info. Sounds like a good plan.

Regarding the Shanghai>Qingdao journey: I would recommend flying, the train
ride is about a 22 hour ride. It would be an overnight ride, and the
landscape isn't very interesting. In comparison, the Shanghai>Qingdao flight
is about 45 minutes long and costs about $85.00 USD. I wouldn't waste a day
on the train ride. Don't worry about the safety of China's domestic
airlines. China Eastern uses new generation Boeing and Airbus planes. I can
arrange the Shanghai>Qingdao flight for you before you arrive, if you want.

Yes, I'll probably be able to meet you at the Shanghai airport. (I assume
you're flying into the new Pudong Airport and not the older Hong Qiao
Airport.) Let me know after you study your plane ticket. If you want, we can
also arrange your lodging in Shanghai.

Dad said that Mom and Jennifer discused travel plans while in Houston
together. Your plan looks good. Hopefully, I'll be able to travel to Beijing
with the family. My advice concerning the consumption of exotic foodstuffs:
eat it all.

Thanks for the timely repsonse. Hope all is well. Write again soon.

Cheers,

Jon Gillaspie
