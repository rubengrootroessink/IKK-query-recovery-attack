Subject: New Lexis-Nexis ID Card

Due to EWS Legal re-organization and limits of Lexis-Nexis' security 
infrastructure, your old Lexis-Nexis IDs are deleted and new IDs are issued 
under the new bill group by your cost center.   Sorry for the inconvenience!  
I am sending all your new ID cards to Becky Spencer to distribute to you.  
Please toss the old one when you receive the new one.   If you don't receive 
a new ID card and would like to have Lexis-Nexis access, please let me know.  

Tomorrow is the Lexis Day for Legal Groups.  Free trainings are scheduled 
from 9:00 - 4:00 at EB48C2.  Lunch is provided by Lexis. You may sign up for 
one or two or whole day trainings.  Go to legal portal Calendar or Lexis Day 
banner to get detailed class schedule  http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/  .  
If interested, R.S.V.P. to Sylvia Hu x36775 as soon as you can.

Thanks,
