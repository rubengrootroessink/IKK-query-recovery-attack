The deal with CMS needs a one page letter agreement. that states that the 
release begins on the latter of the WIC Medicine Bow expansion being fully 
in-service or January 1, 2002.  As strucutured here we would have recall 
rights on this capacity which we could call enact for any of the volumes up 
to the WIC in-service date.  We could not recall any capacity after that date 
and we would give up those recall rights with a letter to WIC upon the 
in-service date of the new pipeline.  Can you please start on this letter 
agreement as a soon as possible?  The CMS guys are a little antsy and this is 
a good deal for us. ( $1.3 MM)

Thanks 

Mark

As we discussed, ENA is going to release a portion of it's Medicine Bow 
capacity to 2 different parties.  We would like to begin this process and 
make sure we follow the proper procedures in the WIC tarriff.  In addition we 
want to make sure that the releases are properly coordinated and go off 
without a hitch.  The following are the terms of the releases and the 
counterparties.  

1.  Counterparty:  J M Huber Corp.
 Quantity:  10,336 MMbtu/d 
 Term:   November 1, 2001 - the term of the contract
 Contract #   41066-000

2. Counterparty:  J M Huber Corp.
 Quantity:  42,337 MMbtu/d 
 Term:   November 1, 2002 - the term of the contract
 Contract #   41066-000

3. Counterparty:  CMS Transmission and Storage
 Quantity:  7,172 MMbtu/d
 Term:   January 1, 2002 - the term of the contract
 Contract #   41066-000

4. Counterparty:  CMS Transmission and Storage
 Quantity:  1,015 MMbtu/d
 Term:   December 1, 2002 - the term of the contract
 Contract #   41066-000

5. Counterparty:  CMS Transmission and Storage
 Quantity:  1,015 MMbtu/d
 Term:   January 1, 2002 - November 30, 2002   
 Contract #   41075-000 ( Volumetric Firm)

Each of these releases would be done with the following terms:

1.  First bidder meeting minimum terms
2.  Permanent release
3.  Hide the minimum rate
4.  The release will be at the contract rate
5.  The release will be recallable
6.  ENA will then follow up with a notice to WIC that we are giving up our 
recall rights at a later date

Please let me know if this looks ok to you and let me know if each of these 
parties are authorized to do capacity releases with WIC.

Thanks for your help.

Mark
