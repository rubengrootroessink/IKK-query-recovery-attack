Gerald:
I need your assitance in finding the right legal/regulatory group, who could 
assist me with some regulatory issues necessary for completing a compression 
project.  
I need to find if new loads in Brookfield, Fairfield County, CT, pay 
Competitive Transition Assessment Charges.  The name of the project is 
Iroquois Eastchester Expansion and we are looking at CL&P's Rate Number 58 
for power supplier.  

I would really appreciate it if you could contact me in case you have a 
contact name.  Once again, thanks for your time and efforts.
