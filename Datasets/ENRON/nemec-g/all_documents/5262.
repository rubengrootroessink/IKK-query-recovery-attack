Two words about my after work activities.  Proper Pumpitude!!  I have to work 
that cheeseburger off.  Why don't I call you on your cell when I get showered 
up and if your already past mi casa or at the bar, I will just meet you 
there.  Sound good?

Boy, you timed that pretty good.  Just walked back in about 10 minutes ago.

I am thinking that I will be here at least until 7 pm.  I will then run home
and walk Sophie and probably be able to either come by your place or just
meet you at Little Woodrows by 8:00.  How does that work for your schedule?
What are you planning on doing after work!

That Cheeseburger sounds good.  I had a cold Grilled Ham and Cheese.  They
ordered it before I left for my appt and then it had ben sitting here for
about an hour before I got ot eat.  Yum Yum Kitty!
