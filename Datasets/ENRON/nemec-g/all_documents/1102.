Brian,

The third paragraph should read more like:

"As a result of the transaction, NBP will provide ownership and management of 
the physical assets using the personnel who have been responsible for 
developing the assets to date.  ENE will continue to provide gas purchase and 
marketing services, financing and risk management services, and will offer 
producer outsourcing services to customers connected to these assets."

We want to make sure the last bit is in the press release as well as the LOI 
as we discussed yesterday.

Thanks,
Brian

Attached is a draft press release. Please provide me with your comments; I 
will then coordinate a response to Northern Border. The latest version of the 
LOU we have distributed has a value of $205 million. I will discuss this with 
Border upon receipt of your comments.
