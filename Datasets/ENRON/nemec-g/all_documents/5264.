TWO TOUGH QUESTIONS

  Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant,
  who had 8 kids
  already,
  three who were deaf, two who were blind, one
  mentally retarded, and she
  Had
  syphilis; would you recommend that she have an
  abortion?

  Read the next question before scrolling down to
  the answer of this one.

  Question 2: It is time to elect a new world
  leader, and your vote
  counts.
  Here are the facts about the three leading
  candidates:

  Candidate A: Associates with crooked politicians,
  and consults with
  astrologists. He's had two mistresses.  He also
  chain smokes and drinks
  8 to 10 martinis a day.

   Candidate B: He was kicked out of office twice,
  sleeps until noon, used
  opium
  in college and drinks a quart  whisky every
  evening.

  Candidate C: He is a decorated war hero. He's a
  vegetarian, doesn't
  smoke,
  drinks an occasional beer and hasn't had any
  extramarital affairs.

  Which of these candidates would be your choice?

  Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the
  answer.


  Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt
  Candidate B is Winston Churchill
  Candidate C is Adolph Hitler

 And by the way: Answer to the abortion question if
 you said yes, you
 just
 killed Beethoven.

 Pretty interesting isn't it. Makes a person think
 before judging
 someone.
 Remember amateurs built the ark
 Professionals built the Titanic.
