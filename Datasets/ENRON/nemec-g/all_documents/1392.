Mark, these are the conracts we discussed last week.  Please refer to Lauri's 
note below.  Let's forward the contract files for the first three to Eric 
Gillaspie in Legal.
Both Lauri and I will need copies of the other contracts.  Once Lauri has 
reviewed the contract copies, she will let me know how to move forward.  Any 
additional contracts that she decides to terminate, we will get those files 
to Eric as well.

Please direct any questions to my attention.  As usual, thanks for your 
assistance.

Jackie

suffixes).  He is out today, but due back tomorrow.  Please let me know if 
you need further info.
