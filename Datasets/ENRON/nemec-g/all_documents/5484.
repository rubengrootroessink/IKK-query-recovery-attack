Gerald,

Keith McClelland (AMUS lawyer), Daniela Horth (Contract Administrator for
AEC Storage and Hub Services Inc. and Wild Goose Storage Inc.)  and I are
available tomorrow morning between 10 and 12 for a conference call.  I am
still trying to confirm that Ryan McGeachie (Credit Analyst) is available.
Does this time look okay for you?  Let me know and I can confirm everything
later today.

If you do have any written comments that would be useful for us to see
beforehand, please send them on to me by email or by fax (403-290-8479).

Thanks so much.

Ann

Ann,  I have completed the review of the comments to the Enfolio.  It might
make the most sense to discuss these over the phone to get quicker
resolution.  Are you available tommorrow afternoon to discuss the comments.

Hello Gerald,

Just a follow up note on the status of the review of our comments on the
new
ENFOLIO.  Please give me a call or drop me a note.  I hope we can get the
contract settled.

I still have not heard what is happening with the credit side.  I have not
received signed confirms as yet.

Regards,

Ann
