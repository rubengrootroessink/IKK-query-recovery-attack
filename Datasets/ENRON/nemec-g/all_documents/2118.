f=20
we can make it after 10:30, then Ed Gottlob can possibly join us.  He hasn'=
t=20
seen the site either. Ed - Let me know if you are interested.

Eric - the online registration form that I refer to is the Password=20
Application.  I can change the wording to reflect this.

Romeo/Shawn - See the attached doc's below and place these in the site.

We are in the home stretch for phase I !!!!
