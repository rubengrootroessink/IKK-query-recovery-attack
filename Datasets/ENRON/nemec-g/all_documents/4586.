I'm sick, too - it really sucks.  Especially since I leave for London
tomorrow evening - aaaahhhhh!  I'm so excited.  Mostly just to get the hell
out of here.  I still haven't packed yet.  I hope I feel better tomorrow
than I do today!  I'll be going to bed early tonight!

Thanks for the heads up!  I was out sick yesterday and will probably be
leaving early today.  Still not feeling so good.  When do you go to London?
Or have you gone already?

Heard on the radio this morning that they're announcing tour dates tomorrow
or the next day - might wanna check into it!
