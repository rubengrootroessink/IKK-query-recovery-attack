Gerald,

Can you please give me a status on this Burlington transaction.  If the 
Denver office is going to enter into this, Credit needs to be notified of 
this to assess the potential risk in the deal.  I know at one point this 
transaction was a hot item, although it seemed to cool down.  Are they now 
looking to get back into it?

Please advise,
Russell

I know about this transaction.  The master would NEED to be signed if this 
deal is to get executed, the master and transaction should be with Burlington 
Resources Trading.  See my original worksheet attached below.
