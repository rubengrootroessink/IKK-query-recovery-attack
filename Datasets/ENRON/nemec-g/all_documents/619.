Gerald, I am pursuing a narrow window for collection of moneys due and owing 
Intratex by Citgo.  I am required to provide information about the company 
status of Intratex, and if it is dissolved as I believe it to be I am to 
provide a copy of its dissolution papers.

I had made this request of Ann Elizabeth but realize she is overwhelmed with 
requests.  Could you possible get that information to me instead?

I would appreciate it!  Thanks!

Candy
