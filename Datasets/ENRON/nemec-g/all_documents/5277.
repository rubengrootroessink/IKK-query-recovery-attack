Hi folks. Just want to confirm, for purposes of the schedules to our purchase 
agreement with Calpine, that the only written documents ENA has with Kern 
river are the Precedent Agreement dated 1/31/01 and the amendment thereto 
dated 2/7/01.  There was an additional, unexecuted amendment included in 
Stephanie's fax to me, so I thought I should double check.  It would be 
helpful if you could get back to me today.  Thanks.

Karen
