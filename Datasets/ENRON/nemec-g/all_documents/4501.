Gerald,

I am sorry for the delay in getting to the Agency Agreement.  It hasn't been
at the top of my priority list.  I have reviewed it this past week.  One
question I have -  typically, I have seen these agreements with an indemnity
clause included.  I noticed that the agreement proposed does not have an
indemnity clause.  I would like to discuss this with you.  Let's discuss
next week and get the agreement done.

Again, sorry for the delay.

Ken Krisa
