Gerald:  

Kevin from MidCon Texas called and was inquiring as to the status of the 
Interconnect agreement.  He said that they had signed it and sent it over for 
HPL's signature.  I have not seen it or heard of anything for several 
months.  Do you know the status?  Would you please let me know either way.

 Thanks,  Jim
