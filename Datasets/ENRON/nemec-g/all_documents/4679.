Hi.  I heard you were sick.  Are you back on the mend?  (Just spoke with 
Bruce -- he told me).  I'm leaving tomorrow to go to the Inauguration in DC, 
but when I get back we'll have to plan on dinner or a movie or something 
fun.  It's been a while.  Maybe those married friends of yours will make us 
dinner???
