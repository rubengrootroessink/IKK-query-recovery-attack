I would like to discuss the draft agreements and need some perspective for 
how they fit into the overall big picture (e.g., the gas agreement doesn't 
explicitly discuss the 2 month lag or nomination issues which may be ok if 
this is covered elsewhere).

When would be a good time?  I have a 1:30 - 2/2:30 meeting but am free 
otherwise.
