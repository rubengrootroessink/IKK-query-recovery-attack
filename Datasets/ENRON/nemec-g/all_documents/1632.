The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like 
you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the 
candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and 
shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe 
since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.

Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but 
I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over 
with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty 
horrible this year.

Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this 
weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and 
I'll talk to you later.
