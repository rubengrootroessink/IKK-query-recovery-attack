Mark and Gerald:

 Attached is a draft of an amendment to the CSA that would guarantee the 
Charges as quoted until December 1, 2000, as discussed.  I have attempted to 
leave in place as much of the previously "agreed-upon" amendment as 
possible.  Please call me if you have questions.

 On a separate note:  Regarding the recent change in equipment configuration, 
because there is a definition of VFD in all 3 agreements,  the best way to 
handle these changes may be a separate Letter Agreement that would replace 
the references to VFD in all 3 agreements with the appropriate substitute, if 
any.
