Dear U2 Fan,

U2.Com is set to host the premiere of director Kevin Godley's new video for
Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of.

A clip from the new video will be live on the site later today, in advance
of the new single, released in European territories next month.

Switching to the other end of U2's career altogether, U2.COM is also now
offering an exclusive download of I Will Follow, the track voted the fans
favourite from BOY after our two week poll. The poll on OCTOBER has just
begun.

We are also now featuring The Oracle - in which fans can ask anything they
like about U2 and get an answer which usually makes no sense at all.  One
fan e-mailed us to say he asked The Oracle  'How are Bono's driving skills?'
The Oracle replied, 'Through the walls we hear the city groan...'

And you only have a few final days to to win a signed set of the complete U2
album collection on vinyl.

Next month we aim to be first with information on the world tour which
begins in  March. Tell your U2 friends to register today!

Best wishes for the holiday season
