It took a lot of effort from ENA Legal (Lisa Mellencamp, Gerald Nemec & some 
help from me), the Transport Desk (Stephanie Miller), the West Desk (Barry 
Tycholiz) and Credit (Bill Bradford and Wendy Conwell), to finalize this very 
funky credit substitution transaction with PG&E Trading (to cover over 
$200million in margin exposure--Thank God it is now finally done.  

If anyone catches wind of a PG&E Energy Trading bankruptcy, please advise 
ASAP so that we can act quickly to exercise our valuation and exercise rights.

Thanks

ENA has successfully acquired the PG&E capacity through EPNG's capacity 
release process. I will forward copies of the awards to legal.

Please call if you have any questions.
