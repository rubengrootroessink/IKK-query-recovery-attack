It was a pretty rough night in Houston.  I awoke about 3 am due to loud 
thunder and rain.  Big portions of Houston were without power this morning.  
It makes it really tough to get out of bed when it is raining like that.  
Conducive to just curling up and sleeping for a couple more hours.

Well today is your big day.  Last of the semester.  Congrats.  Try not to get 
too drunk tonight.  Oh hell, what am I talking about.  Try and get as lit as 
you can.

The game was fun, except that the Astros got blasted.  I really don't care 
that much though.  I just enjoy the atmosphere at a baseball game.  Kinda 
like a day in the park.  This week will be a short one for me.   A friend 
invited me on a trip to Mexico this weekend to Playa del Carmen.  We are 
leaving Thursday morning and return Sunday.  Probably do some scuba diving 
and hang out on the beach.  I am really looking forward to it.  Need to get 
out of town for a couple of days and clear my head.

Are you moving back to Katy for the summer?  Did you figure out if the UH 
classes will work for you or are you going to work?  Stay in touch.
Gerald

Gerald,
 How's the weather in Houston?  The sun is finally coming out here a
bit.  We had a pretty bad storm come through last night.
 Did you have fun at your baseball game last week?  Who won?
  This week shouldn't be too bad for me I think.  I have a take home
final due tomorrow and my birthday is on Wed.  I may take a load of my
stuff back to Katy on Thurs.  THe end of the semester is here...I can't
believe it!
 I hope your week runs smoothly.  Try to stay dry today.
Katie
