In today's Chronicle (Business Section) there is an article of the breakup on 
the Wildhorse Partnership between KM and Tom Brown; KM received cash and 
Colorado assets and Tom Brown received other assets(probably the system 
involving our production since Utah assets went to Tom Brown.

Gerald can you please circulate a copy of the article at the next team 
meeting......thanks   bng
