Eight more U2 shows for the 'Elevation Tour 2001' in North America
(including a 4th Chicago show on May 16th) go on pre-sale to U2.COM members

Saturday January 27th.

The shows included in this pre-sale are Houston (April 2nd) Lexington (May
4th), Pittsburgh (May 6th), Columbus (May 7th), Milwaukee (May 9th),

limited number of tickets will be on sale to U2.COM members who provide this
