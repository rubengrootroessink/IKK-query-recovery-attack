Gerald,

Wanted to keep you in the loop on where Hanover would like to see things 
going with our contract.  They've been complaining almost from day 1 and 
their format is getting a little more formal and aggressive as seen in the 
attached spreadsheet and memo.  The attached memo in my opinion violates in 
several points made the spirit of the intent of the agreement as executed.  
The guy that put this together (Jerry Griffith) was not a Hanover employee 
when the contract was negotiated.  I believe he is being put up to this by 
his management who appear to want to change some very fundamental things that 
were agreed to (most of which were explicitly spelled out in the document).  
No action requested of you I just wanted you to be informed. Thanks

Ken

this is our strawman, best shot at a methodology to get started;
pls comment,
I would like to proceed with this and try to get together in Denver
sometime during the first week in July, maybe Weds & Thurs & or Friday or
possibly
the end of next week.
We need this resolved, an acceptable consencious to allow us to proceed as
necessary in the future.
thx
Jerry
