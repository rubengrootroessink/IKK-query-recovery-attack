That's fine.  Actually my friend Paul called me and wanted to get together 
for a beer tonight with Andy, so it looks like I will be blowing off working 
out.  Uh-oh.  That sounds fine.  Tell Shannon hello at the movies.  Ha Ha  
just kidding :-O.  

Can't wait to hear your skiiillz on the radio.

Hey there!

Just wanted to let you know that I am planning on going to see a movie at
7:30 and I should be out no later than 9:30 and then will head to walk Sophie
and then back over to your place.  I will call you when I am leaving the
movie theatre.  Will that be too late?  You can also workout without having
to rush!

Also, I am getting ready to go into the studio and do another commercial.  I
found that tape with my other commercials that I have done.  I will bring
that with me tonight.  Aren't you so impressed with all my abilities?
