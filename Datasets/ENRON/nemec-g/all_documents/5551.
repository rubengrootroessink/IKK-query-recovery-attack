Gerald, Mark,

Here's the Purchase Confirmations I've drafted.  Also included in this file 
is the ENA Purchase Summary to Crestone.
Please note Kennedy's Confirmation - I put a notation at the bottom regarding 
the additional purchase at GD-.55.

Please let me know what needs to be changed.  We need to send these out to 
the producers by tomorrow.

Thanks,




Theresa
