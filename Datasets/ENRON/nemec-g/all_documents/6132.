Gerald,

Palo Alto just sent me a copy of their old management services agreement.  I 
don't know if it will be useful at all but I do know that it is a document 
that their city attorney is familiar with.  FYI.

Thanks,
Kim

Kim,

Attached is the City's current boilerplate contract for gas services.  Let
me know if this agreement will work.
