Ever wish you could remember some of Norm's greetings on "Cheers"?

SAM: "What's shaking Norm?"
NORM: "All four cheeks & a couple of chins."

SAM: "What'll you have Normie?"
NORM: "Well, I'm in a gambling mood Sammy. I'll take a glass of whatever comes
out of that tap."
SAM: "Looks like beer, Norm."
NORM: "Call me Mister Lucky."

SAM: "Whatcha up to Norm?"
NORM: "My ideal weight if I were eleven feet tall."

WOODY: "Pour you a beer, Mr. Peterson?"
NORM: "All right, but stop me at one.... make that one-thirty."

WOODY: "How's it going Mr. Peterson?"
NORM: "It's a dog eat dog world, Woody & I'm wearing Milk Bone underwear."

SAM: "What's the story Norm?"
NORM: "Boy meets beer. Boy drinks beer. Boy meets another beer."

WOODY: "What's going on Mr. Peterson?"
NORM: "The question is what's going in Mr. Peterson? A beer please, Woody."

WOODY: "Can I pour you a beer Mr. Peterson?"
NORM: "A little early isn't it, Woody?"
WOODY: "For a beer?"
NORM: "No, for stupid questions."

Hey, wouldn't you like to hang out with a bunch of people that already know 
your
 name this Thursday?  And maybe some new ones?  I knew that you would.  Come
join us at an old Houston institution.  We'll be in the back bar area in the
private room!

WHERE:    Cadillac Bar
          1802 Shepherd Dr.
          (just south of I-10.....and that's closer to you than downtown 
BEEDS!)

          Houston, TX
          (713) 862-2020

WHEN:                     Thursday, April 5th
          6:30

WHY:      'Cause when's the last time you got your head slapped during a 
tequila
 shot?

Bon voyage!

T-bone
