Gerald,

My suggestions/changes are in bold.  And not to sound like a broken record, 
but, what should I do re sending Wildhorse something to inform them of the  
contact list - names and phone numbers, and let them know where to send the 
transport invoice to.  As I stated before, per my conversations with Becky at 
Wildhorse, they need this information set up in their system before we nom.  

Mark - did you find out if noms are officially due on Wed or Thurs?
