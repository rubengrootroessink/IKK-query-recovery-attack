Gerald,

I have revised the letter slightly to address it to Randy Curry and will send 
it out from here.

Thanks for the effort.

Brian

Brian,  Attached is our response to Bridgeline's issue list (revised based on 
our meeting) with a short cover letter.  I addressed the cover letter from 
you to Robert Morgan.  If that is not correct let me know.  I am sending a 
hard copy of these docs for your signature.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.
