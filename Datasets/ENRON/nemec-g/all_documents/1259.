Just as an FYI.  This is what I get for asking why the BLM permits in the EMS 
files don't have EMS' name on them.

We received a letter today from Kennedy requesting a partial relinquishment
and requesting Enron be allowed to receive a partial assignment (the
pipeline only) of their rights under the 2 BLM grants issued to Kennedy.  We
now need to get the Form 299 signed, and sent out along with a check for
$50.

FYI, from the conversation we had with Ruth today, if the BLM requires an
archaeological study on fee ownership (Daly), we may need to come up with a
plan.  For years now Daly has adamantly refused to allow an archaeologist on
his property.  BLM refuses to issue any permits without a study.
Stalemate....however, I am optimistic the assignment will be rubber stamped
without all the hassle and history they've been through on this issue.

Ken

As a general rule, EMS will need a certificated plat for every landowner
that we have taken an agreement from in our name AND there has been
construction of any facility on the property.   For instance, I understand
from Ted that there is an agreement in one system with the Louis McBeth
Trust but EMS has never constructed any pipeline on the property.  Since
Wyoming has the one year rule with respect to recordation, we will still
need to have a plat showing the location of the McBeth Trust property but
it need not be a certificated plat because there haven't been any
facilities constructed on the land.  If there has been a facility
constructed, it has to have a certificated plat for the affected property.

However, there is always an exception to the rule.  I had assumed there
were no facilities constructed on land which had been acquired by Kennedy
or any other 3rd party.  However, I found at last week that there are at
least a few BLM sites where the property is not (yet) in the name of EMS
but is still in the name of Kennedy.  For those, I have asked Ted to secure
an assignment of rights from Kennedy into EMS.  If it is a site where both
Kennedy and EMS have facilities, then we will need a partial assignment of
rights.  However, the plat will need to show the entirety of the lands
covered by the permit and will need to specifically delineate the right of
way/compressor site owned by EMS.  It need not show the lands/property
which are still held by Kennedy (or any other producer) but I think it
would be a helpful tool to have.

One other thing, in the interest of expediency and efficiency, just have
all of the corrected plats sent directly to Chuck and Ted's attention in
Gillette.  I am going to be sending them the electronic version of the
Memorandums of Agreement to which the plats need to be attached and they
can handle it from there.  Chuck will send me copies for my file.


Thanks!

Sandi, Steve, Dick,  Lon;

Heads  up!

I was informed  yesterday that Forerunner is to provide property plats for
the gathering lines  installed by Kennedy Oil in the Box Draw System.
These are the lines  labeled as existing on the Box Draw Base Map.

Murph, All you can do is walk the lines (Remember  no ATV's on Daly's
property) with your GPS and do the best you  can.

We also need to get  plats done for all the compressor sites as well, both
screw sites and  booster sites. We should have pretty good data on the
site locations from  what we've been providing the DEW.

I will let you know  later if we need to provide plats for the receipt
points  too.

I'll talk with you  later and hopefully have more details;
KK
