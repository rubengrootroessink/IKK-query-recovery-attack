Gerald,

Arvel asked I forward this to you.  Received yesterday evening.  It is
definitely a one way deal the way it is presented.  I am in the process of
making some changes that I would like to propose back to TBI.  I will
forward those to you as well - should be this afternoon.  I won't send
anything back until we talk further.

Ken Krisa
