Gerald - we have obtained a copy of a complaint filed against Michael  
Guthrie, dba MTG Operating Company by an employee, John Leisy.? Apparently,  
Leisy was hired by MTG in exchange for salary and a royalty in Guthrie's  
drilling and well program.? He?has been terminated and is suing for  lost 
wages and the royalty interest.? We recalled that Enron had some  dealings 
with MTG, and wanted to give you the chance to review this complaint,  if you 
are interested.? I would be happy to send you a copy of the  complaint if you 
are.
?
Thank you, 
Melissa Hughes
