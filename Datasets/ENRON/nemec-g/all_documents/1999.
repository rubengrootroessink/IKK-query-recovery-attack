Greg,

Attached for your review and further handling is a red-lined version 
indicating our changes for the FPL/HPL Confidentiality Agreement.  Most of 
the changes were to make the agreement bilateral.



Thanks,

Greg,

I have attached a plain vanilla confidentiality agreement that allows us to
discuss in detail our potential site in east Texas. Please have the
appropriate person it and return it to me for our files.I will return a
fully executed copy to you .

Thanks,

Bill
