Global for the Brazos Valley Project Interconnection Agreement.  Please

practice'  .

In the second line, after the words "...to the Standards.", add the phrase

Delete the paragraph on term and add the following:  "This Agreement shall be 
effective as of thes date herein writtten above and shall remain in full 
force and effect for a primary term of twenty years ("Primary Term"), and 
shall continue in full force and effect thereafter so long as there is an
