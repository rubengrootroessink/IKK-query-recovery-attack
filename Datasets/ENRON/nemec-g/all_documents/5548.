Hey there-
Ryan has not been feeling well all weekend and still isn't...so
unfortunately we were thinking of moving the dinner to this Thursday.  I
really hope that still works for you guys.  I don't think Ryan knows you
guys are coming, but had indicated a while ago how fun it would be to have
dinner with everyone...so I was still going to try and keep it a surprise.
Please let me know if that's still okay so I can change the reservation.

Thanks.
