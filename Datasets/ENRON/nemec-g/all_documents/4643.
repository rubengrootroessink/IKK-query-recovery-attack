Mr. Musselwhite,

If you could give the attached document to Mr. Jerry Campbell when he is in 
your offices today, I would appreciate.  If you could ask him to especially 
focus on Schedule 5 - coal testing and Btu adjustment provisions, I would 
appreciate that as well.

If you have any questions about the foregoing, please do not hesitate to call 
me at (713) 221-1396.  Best regards.
