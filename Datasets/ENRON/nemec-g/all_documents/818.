Gerald, as I mentioned in my voice mail, I have not heard from Eric.  Please 
advise as to any changes I need to make to the form or as to how to roll it 
out.

Eric,

I revised the transportation confirmation form and want to know if you will 
take a look at it.  I took out of the body of the text the specific receipt 
points and delivery points and associated rates.  Let me know if this is 
acceptable.
