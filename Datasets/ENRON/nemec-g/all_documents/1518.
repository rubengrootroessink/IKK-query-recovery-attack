Trust me, I know about being swamped.  I was here until 8:30 last night.  The
homecoming game is a good choice.  I'll be going in on Thursday evening 
because
I'm planning to run in the 2 mile Gator Gallop fun run on Friday morning.  The
run is followed by the homecoming parade and then Gator Growl is Friday night.
Gator Growl is the largest student run pep rally in the country and they 
always
have two or three nationally recognized comedians.  The game is Sat and then 
we
could fly home on Sun on either the 7:00 a.m. that arrives at 8:30 (this is 
the
flight I usually take even though it means getting up early on Sun) or the 
12:25
that arrives at 1:50.  I usually fly in and out of Jacksonville.  I've 
checked a
number of flights today and you could fly in any time on Thurs or Fri and out 
on
Sun for $196.  Not too bad.  I'll pick up the rental car costs and we can stay
at my brother's (college apt, but it will work for a night or two).  Let me 
know
what you want to do.  I'll probably book my flight today or tomorrow to get 
this
cheap rate.

Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been
swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does
a flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am
planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.

I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than
the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty
intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will
probably go.

Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns'
schedule
for comparison.

          Gators              Longhorns
Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas

Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was
a lot
of fun.

So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.
