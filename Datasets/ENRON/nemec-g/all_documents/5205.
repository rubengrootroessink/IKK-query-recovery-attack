Dear Fellow Diver,

Thank you one and all.  January certification numbers were 11 % higher than 
last years.  We were trying to figure out which of our marketing initiatives 
have created this demand.  Then it hit me.  More than 200,000 PADI divers now 
receive this newsletter.  We've been asking you to get a friend and get wet.  
Well, you have been doing a great job.  I will give you the credit for the 
ten of thousands of new divers entering our industry.  (Besides, if I give 
credit to the sales and marketing department, they'll want more money.)  So, 
thank you very much, but please don't stop.  Find at least one person a day 
to share your excitement and enthusiasm with for our great sport. Then, point 
them in the direction of your PADI Diver Center or Resort.

More than 100 employees from our worldwide offices attended the DEMA (Diving 
Equipment and Marketing Association) 2001 show in New Orleans, Louisiana.  It 
was a major success.  Diving Science and Technology (DSAT), a division of 
PADI, launched the first course in its new TecRec technical diving program, 
Tec Deep Diver. The course was extremely well accepted by the Technical 
Diving community.  However, it is not recommended for everyone.  We welcome 
you to check it out at you local dive center, but be patient as it might be a 
while before they are ready to teach the program, the prerequisites are high 
and it is demanding!

We also highlighted our expanded line of products for the Bubblemaker 
program.  Dads, moms, aunts, uncles, siblings and others should look into 
throwing a Bubblemaker party for the kids in their family.  I think roller 
skating rinks and Chucky Cheese Pizza Parlors are feeling a little nervous.  
Call your local PADI Dive center and set one up.  By the way, its easier to 
clean up after than a regular birthday party, just dry the kids off and take 
them home.  Mom's liking that already...

Per my request in the last Fellow Diver newsletter, I did enjoy meeting a 
couple of PADI Divemasters who introduced themselves to me at DEMA as Fellow 
Diver Readers.  Yes, only two.  Now, come on people!  Some of you have been 
diving and getting this newsletter since April 1999. Our newly revised 
Instructor Development Course (IDC), also released during the DEMA show, is 
your ticket to a new career.  With a new emphasis on home study and the 
ability to credit the Assistant Instructor certification towards the Open 
Water Scuba Instructor rating, you've run out of excuses not to become a PADI 
Instructor. Oh, I left off one other important reason. There are an 
incredible number of terrific job opportunities presently available too!

Project AWARE had a great DEMA show as well.  I was fortunate to be able to 
attend their annual Board of Governors Breakfast where I spent some time 
speaking with the charming, Emmy-nominated actress and PADI spokesperson, 
Sharon Lawrence. I'm also told by my staff, that Ms. Lawrence is a great 
bowler!

That's a rap on the news from this years DEMA. My friends at ZuluSports asked 
me to remind you that ZuluSports has got what you want and need.  Go to 
www.zulusports.com to read up on exciting places to dive (Dive Like Bond, 
James Bond), the best new scuba must-haves, scuba gear reviews and tips and 
tricks for new divers. Also, sign up for the ZuluNews - their weekly email 
newsletter filled with helpful resources for outdoor sports enthusiasts!

I'd really like to hear from you if you we're one of the first PADI Divers to 
receive the Fellow Diver Newsletter.  If you were PADI Open Water Diver 
certified in February or March of 1999 and have been receiving this 
newsletter since then, please drop me a note at brianc@padi.com and tell me 
about your dive experiences, particularly your efforts toward continuing your 
dive education. If you'd like, send me your address as well. I have a few 
special gifts to send out.

In closing, I really do want to thank all of you for the many emails you send 
me.  I do my best to get to them all, and provide a reply when I can.  
Please, do me a favor. Many of you share incredibly personal moments about a 
dive or a dive holiday.  I would love to use these notes in testimonials on 
the PADI web site or in Sport Diver magazine.  Please indicate whether we can 
publish these notes as we feel necessary.  Your privacy will be vehemently 
protected and we would only use your first name and city as reference.  If 
appropriate, and as many of you do, include a digital photo so we might post 
it on the PADI Today home page.  Imagine telling your dive buddies that your 
story is on the home page of the PADI website being viewed by more than 9,400 
people a day!

Now get a friend and go diving!

Till next time,

Brian Cronin,
Senior Vice President, Business Development & International Business.
