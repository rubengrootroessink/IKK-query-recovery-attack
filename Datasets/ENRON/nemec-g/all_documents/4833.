Gerald,

This is the bid response letter for the Wildhorse assets.  Any comments on
it?  I don't mention anything about the lawsuit or turning in a proposal to
TBI for acquisition of their production assets at South Canyon.

We also want to turn in on the 9th a proposal to Tom Brown (separate letter,
separate proposal) for acquisition of there South Canyon production assets.
We will be discussing this on Tuesday  morning meeting  in Houston with
Scott and Steve and the crew. I think your presence may be needed.

Ken
