 Gerald,

 I wanted to get you started on this ASAP as we discussed.  I don't expect a 
finished product but 
 preferr that you initiate the draft and I'll work with it as necessary in 
you absence.  Thanks for you
 cooperation.

 I have attached a summary of the Parking Provision and the CSA in addition 
to the Term Sheet
 that is dated but you get the idea.
