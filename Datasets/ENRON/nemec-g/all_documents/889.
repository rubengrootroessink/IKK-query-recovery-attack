Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my 
revisions.  The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for 
the first project.  I change to reflect the change we made at that time.  As 
you will notice it is quite a few changes.  However, since Gregg signed off 
on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.
