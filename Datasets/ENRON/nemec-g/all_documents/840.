Hi Mr. Nemec, how are ya? Hope all is well. I am going through my
appointments and was going to see if you wanted to try and meet for lunch
one day next week. I can't go on Wednesday, but the rest of my week looks
pretty open. I want to try Hard Rock Cafe downtown beacuse I have trade
there and I have never tried it before. Besides, it is close to your office.

Call me or e-mail me if you want to try and get together next week. Talk to
you soon.

Cynthia
