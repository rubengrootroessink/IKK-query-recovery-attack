To all:

I've put together a list of outstanding issues that need to be resolved prior 
to the Jan 19 closing.  Let me know if I've forgotten anything.

I'll be out of the office Monday through Wednesday, but can be reached by my 
cell phone (713.569.1131) or pager (888.472.7841).  Also, I'll be working out 
of the NY office all day on Tuesday.

Regards,

Heather
