Somehow, I have found myself volunteering to be a United Way Campaigner for 
the year 2000.   My best determination, of why I volunteered (not being a 
volunteer by nature), is that I believe that the United Way is one of the 
"Lifelines" critical to the quality of life, and life itself, for many in our 
community.  You may not know, that the United Way Agencies help one out of 
every two people living in our community.   When I discovered this fact, I 
was astonished at the needs of our community.  I believe that I had become 
complacent, surrounding myself only with those fortunate enough to be 
employed by a company like Enron.  

With knowledge of the needs of my community, I can no longer, in good 
conscience, be complacent.  I hope that each of you will join me, and others 
in the Enron organization, in making a contribution or pledge to the United 
Way.  I am not an "Enforcer"; I have however, by accepting the role of a 
Campaigner, become a "Tracker" of contributions.  I am not concerned with the 
level of your contribution ( in fact, I will never know the amount of your 
contribution), but I do wish for you to join me in support of less fortunate 
members of our community.  No amount is too small.........
A $25 Donation provides four families with a weeks worth of food!    

Enron's goal is to have 100% of its employees reach out and make at least a 
minimal contribution.  I share this goal for our group.  Won't you please 
join me in this worthy effort.  

Sincerely,
BNG

P.S.  This year, all pledges and contributions must be done by using the 
computer system.  It is easy................ It has to be 
easy...............Since I have already accomplished this task.
