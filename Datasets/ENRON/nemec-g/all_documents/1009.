I have received the production and pricing information for the month of 
June.  Crescendo should expect to receive about $180,000 for their 
production.  This is net transport and compression charges.  I have several 
questions, which I have put calls into the appropriate Enogex/OG&E person.  I 
am uncertain as to when the wire will be received.  Attached is a spreadsheet 
providing you with more information.  Please let me know if you would like to 
receive this email each month, and also, if you would like a hard copy of the 
information I have received - production by wellhead.  I will be forwarding 
this to David Defrance [Crescendo accounting person].

This gas is termed up thru September.




questions:
when will the wire be sent?
price is questar less .01, per kirk harbert, it s/b questar plus .01 [he said 
they would waive the 2 cent marketing fee].
how is compression fee calc?
what's the deal with the imbalance of 22,316 owed to wildhorse for this 
month.  what was the imbal as of 6/01?
we pay for compressor fuel also [on top of comp fee]?
compressor fuel is a $ amount, and is charged based on questar flat.
what's with the transport rounding?
