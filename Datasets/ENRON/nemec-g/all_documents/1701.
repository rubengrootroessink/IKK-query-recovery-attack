I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever 
floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in the 
confines of your own mind  : )

Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had 
squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney, 
remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue 013 
from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes all 
possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and Yankees have 
no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas."  

Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at the 
game.

Brian
