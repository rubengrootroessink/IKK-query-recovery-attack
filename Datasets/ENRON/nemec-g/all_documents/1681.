Horoscopes 
? 














By Lloyd Schumner Sr.

Aries: (March 21--April 19) 
After enduring the false smiles and empty promises of the business world for 
22 years, you'll appreciate the candor of the DEA agents assigned to you. 

Taurus: (April. 20--May 20) 
It seems like another sleepy day around your house. Unless, of course, you 
live at 332 Pheasant Drive in Yuma, AZ. 

Gemini: (May 21--June 21) 
You've lost your enthusiasm, but you're unsure if it was "damped" or 
"dampened." 

Cancer: (June 22--July 22) 
Cancer would like to take this opportunity to point out that it was right 
about the unrest in Yugoslavia. 

Leo: (July 23--Aug. 22) 
Though you've been telling everyone that you "went down on a boatload of 
sailors," the aircraft carrier Nimitz is actually a "ship."

Virgo: (Aug. 23--Sept. 22) 
You will make religious and scientific history when you develop a machine 
that converts standard English measurements to Islam.
? 
Libra: (Sept. 23--Oct. 23) 
While it's true that life is not a movie, many of your problems will be 
solved when the Army destroys the giant lizard 10 minutes before the end. 

Scorpio: (Oct. 24--Nov. 21) 
Things have certainly changed for you during these last few years. For one 
thing, eating a complete breakfast is now more important than ever. 

Sagittarius: (Nov. 22--Dec. 21) 
You will be hailed as a Catholic genius when you invent a new rhythm that's 
45 percent effective in preventing non-predestined pregnancies. 

Capricorn: (Dec. 22--Jan. 19) 
You will be one step closer to perfection when famed Italian engineer Massimo 
Bordi redesigns you for better airflow and optimal fuel atomization. 

Aquarius: (Jan. 20--Feb. 18) 
Wednesday will provide those who know you a perfect opportunity to marvel 
about how right Dante was about the fate of moneylenders. 

Pisces: (Feb. 19--March 20) 
The stars indicate success for you, but they do so with enough ambiguity to 
cover any possible alternatives.
