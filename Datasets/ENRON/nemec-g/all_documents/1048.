couple things.   i was wondering ... did  wildhorse declare unprofitability?  

and scott suggested that instead of telling them that we will be considering 
laying our own gathering system, [don't tell them now what we may do], 
instead of telling them that, to tell them that we will need to quickly 
evaluate other alternatives in getting our gas to the plant.  that we will 
need to do this quickly, because of the long lead times needed.

i guess this looks good to me.  you do ask for a response by aug 1st, which 
means that they will get this on monday, and have 24 hrs to turn it around.  
didn't know if that's what you wanted.

i found something small for you to change up.
