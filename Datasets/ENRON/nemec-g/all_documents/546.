As you are probably aware, your department has been selected to participate 
in Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process and your system has just been 
inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working with 
your department co-ordinator, Sheri Cromwell, to consolidate this information 
to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please call Lee Steele at 713-345-8259.
