Andrew,

Please find attached the latest version of the Stagecoach LOI.  I have gone=

over my changes with Gerald Nemec, but will not send this document out to T=
GP=20
until I have your approval of it.  Jean is looking over a copy and will be=

the one signing it before it goes out to TGP.

In summary, the changes were made to the following sections:

? Price float section =01) Article I, Section 3
? Term and Exclusivity =01) Article II, Sections 1 and 2

Let me know if you are comfortable with this latest version of the LOI and =

will send it out asap.

Thanks,

John
