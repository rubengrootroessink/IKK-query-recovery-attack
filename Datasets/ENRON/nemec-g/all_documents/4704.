Dear Fellow Diver;

I hope everyone had a great holiday season and received the scuba gift they
wanted.  It appears many of you took my advice and bought gift certificates
for friends and family and gave the gift of scuba.

I'm happy to share some big news regarding Project AWARE. Kristin Vallete,
Manager of the Project AWARE Foundation was asked to attend a special
environmental meeting hosted by Commerce Secretary Maneta in Washington
D.C. to speak about its 2001 initiative, "Protect the Living Reef".  This
is very timely as the United Nations has declared 2001 as the year of
 Protecting the Reef.  Project AWARE was recognized for its efforts in
protecting the marine environment and making PADI Divers (hey that's you)
aware and responsible for their impact on the marine environment.  So,
congratulations Kristin, Project AWARE, and especially to all of you for
your support of this important effort. (http://www.projectaware.org)
Some of you know that we have DEMA just ahead of us.  Others are now asking
themselves, "what is DEMA?" DEMA stands for the Diving Equipment and
Marketing Association and later this month they will host the industry's
largest show in New Orleans, LA.  PADI and its Worldwide Subsidiaries will
have over 100 people in its 60 X 40 booth.  At the show this year, we will
be introducing the DSAT TecRec Deep program.  PADI will be distributing the
Diving Science And Technology (DSAT) program through its membership of
100,000 professional members and 4600 retailers and resorts.  This is one
tough demanding course. CAUTION: This course is not for everyone.  You will
need some serious diving experience to be accepted into training for this
program. Find out more on the PADI website. (http://www.padi.com/courses)
We will also be releasing new support material for the Bubblemaker Program,
launching our new PADI Open Water Video, and lots of other materials
designed to keep our professional members at the top of their game.  By the
way, since we started this little (almost 200,000!) news letter in April of
1999, some of you have gone on to become PADI Divemasters.  Maybe I'll see
you at DEMA.  If you get this and are at DEMA, please stop by the booth and
say hello.

At DEMA, we will be taking the opportunity to say congratulations to our
friends at Skin Diver Magazine.  PADI is celebrating its 35th year and Skin
Diver is celebrating its 50th year. If you ever read an issue of SDM, drop
my friend Al Hornsby, Publisher a note congratulating them on 50 years, he
can be reached at hornsbya@petersenpub.com.

Another magazine, TAUCHEN, published in Germany and one of the most widely
read in Europe has chosen PADI, "Best Training Agency" for the third year
in a row.  Thank you PADI Members, PADI Divers, and out wonderful team in
Hetlingen, Switzerland at PADI Europe.

I'll give you an update on DEMA and all the buzz from the show next month.
Until then, get a friend, and go diving.

Till next Month

Brian Cronin
Senior Vice President,
Business Development and International Business

BTW:  The PADI Diving Society Event in Cayman was such a hit (now you didn't
hear this here) we are going to have 4 more this year.  We're sewing up the
details at DEMA so read your Sport Diver Magazine in the U.S. or visit the
PTN website and look for info as it becomes available.
