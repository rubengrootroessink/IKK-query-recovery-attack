I have NOT read any of the following material.  I wanted to forward the 
attached information from Wildhorse on to everyone for an initial review 
ASAP.  Based on my verbal conversations with Kent Harris (Wildhorse) just 
now, we will probably need a meeting just to discuss their intent and 
understand the variables affecting the proposal.  Also, as you will read 
below, this is only a working draft; i.e. they still have to make additional 
revisions.............

After an in-depth analysis, I will present various options for the group to 
discuss and revise, if appropriate.  

Thx.

P.S.  If I've left someone off the list above, please forward.  I will 
caution that since we are officially involved in a sensitive (potentially 
difficult) negotiation, it may be more effective to have a smaller audience 
reviewing the proposal options to ensure there is no leakage of our leverage 
or negotiating position.

Attached so that you can get started is a draft of the proposed Gathering
Agreement. I am still reviewing and updating the agreement. At the very
least, I still need to review and possibly modify the following sections:
 1.13 - Delivery Point(s)
 1.20 - Gathering or Gathering Services
 1.36 - Plant
 1.37 - Plant Delivery Point
 1.38 - Plant FL&U
 1.39 - Plant Receipt Points
 1.41 - Processor
 1.45 - Shipper's Gas
 1.46 - Shipper's Residue Gas
 Appendix "A" - FL&U language
 And last, but not least, all of the articles on commitments,
pressures, obligations, etc. that were originally modified in the Enogex
draft that Frank Nessinger created last year.

Thanks for your patience. I will have the entire completed draft to you by
this Friday at the latest.

Thanks,
Kent
