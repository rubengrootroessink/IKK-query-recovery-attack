I wanted to advise you that we are researching the term, receipt and delivery 
points, volumes, and associated rates of the two Entex contracts under which 
they are transporting a total of 25,000/d.  I have forwarded the original 
contract and amendments to Gerald Nemec for his review.  He is confirming 
current term, rate language, volumes, and transport points with me.  I will 
keep you advised as I know more about these contracts.
