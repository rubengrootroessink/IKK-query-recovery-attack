Gerald, I have reviewed this letter and am ok with the format.  

1. the schedule that will be attached will be in excel format and I will 
forward to you a draft of this document.
2. the payment language if made by cheque instead of wire transfer should 
read.... Payment one is being paid via the enclosed cheque #....... in the 
amount of $xxx,xxx.Receipt of this cheque is acknowledged by 
__________________on __________, 2001. 

Leave the rest of the language the same,  Patina and FMI Weld will be 
receiving payment via cheque. 

Pls set up both letters as per this note. 

BT

Subject: Payment One Statement

Barry,  Attached is a draft of the Payment One statement.  This one is set up 
for the wire transfer, so slight mods would be required for a payment by 
check.  Please review and lets discuss.
