Gerald,

Please prepare a draft of a PSA for Intec Engineering.  They provide 
engineering, procurement and project management services to the offshore 
industry and specialize in pipelines and terminals.  You can use the one you  
prepared for PCS as the basis.  I am negotiating the unit rate attachment.

Thanks,

Nick
