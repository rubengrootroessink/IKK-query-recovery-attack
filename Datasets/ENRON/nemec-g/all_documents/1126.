Gerald,
 
 Paul Miller has requested that I provide copies of the executed Bighorn 
gathering agreements for CMS Oil & Gas and Pennaco to Gulfstar.

 I have a copy of the Pennaco agreement, but it was provided as a document 
during the Bighorn Due Diligence.  I do not have a copy of a CMS Oil & Gas 
Gas Gathering Agreement.  

 What is your thought about Northern Border providing the Pennaco Agreement 
to Gulfstar?    If that is acceptable, do you have access to the CMS Oil & 
Gas Gathering Agreement?

 Thanks.  Eva.
