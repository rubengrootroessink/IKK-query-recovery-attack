Gerald, we need to raise a letter to the Kern Shippers which outlines the 
payment calculation and payment terms (i.e. chegue or wire transfer).  

Can you raise a draft for me to review. I am having a summary of each of the 
terms that is being made and will get this up to you. 

Payments via wire transfer will be done on May 25, Payments by cheque will be 
raised next week. Any other payments will be set up as commercial 
arrangements and thas probably will include, Crestone ( one time payment 
only), and Cannon ( payment to be defered until next year). 

Can I get a draft of this letter  and then we can discuss.
