Gerald,

Additional suggestions from one of my colleagues, Natalie Futch. (I asked her 
for a blunt assessment. She complied.) Her version is better than mine.

Bill -

Chris Hilger's letter appears confrontational and inflammatory. I'm sure that 
the letter to which he is responding is similarly belligerent. However, if 
Enron's goal is to avoid litigation and expense in this matter, this letter 
does not work toward that goal.

Unless there is some strategic reason to respond with specific dates and 
conversations, I think the only necessary sentences in paragraph one are one 
and three. Only the first sentence, as amended, is necessary in paragraph 
two. See my proposed revisions attached.

Natalie
