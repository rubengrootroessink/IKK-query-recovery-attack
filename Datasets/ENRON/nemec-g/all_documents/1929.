I believe that it would be Legal's position that we not ignore the reference 
to the "General Terms and Conditions" since it serves as additional terms to 
the "special terms" of the transaction.  GTC's allow for resolution of 
payment failure, force majeure, liability, etc.  To include it in the 
description guarantees that those terms are included.  Without the inclusion, 
the product description would have to be expanded to include many (if not 
all) of the terms contained in the GTC.  

Eventhough the transaction may not be "confirmed," the Counterparty may elect 
to request the GTC at any time.  Reason?  The GTC resolves potential 
conflicts and defines the rights of the parties.  The counterparty may not 
necessarily require a confirmation.

Ultimately, Legal will need to approve the action if the GTC is removed from 
the product description, but I would be interested to know on what basis they 
would allow the GTC to be dropped from the description.  These are my 
thoughts (recommendations?).

The product description specifically designates a GTC -if we are not 
confirming the transactions should we make this reference?  Other than that, 
it seems ok.  For those that have not been involved in the discussions, this 
type of transaction will not bridge automatically from EOL to Sitara.  It 
will have to be monitored and entered manually.  Since this will be a 
capacity release deal, the pipeline contract number that we a releasing will 
be a crucial piece of information when entering the transport capacity deal.
