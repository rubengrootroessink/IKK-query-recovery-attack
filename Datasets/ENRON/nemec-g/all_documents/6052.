Gerald,

Attached is an electronic copy of the most recent Stagecoach Compression 
Services Agreement.  This version reflects the comments that you made while 
in San Antonio.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or further 
revisions.  I will keep you updated on the status of the deal.

Thanks for your help,

John
