You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did
you?  In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.
I will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.  Any chance I could get you
to drop buy every couple of days and pick up my newspaper and mail and put
them inside?  Would appreciate it.

I pay her $50 per visit and she comes every two weeks.  Not a bad deal.

A little of the sauce got in the way of some of my moving plans this
weekend.  I should be out this week sometime, though.

What do you pay that cleaning lady per month?  Not having to do laundry
anymore all most makes it worth it, huh?  We might have to look into that.

Later,
Ryan
