Gerald,

I booked the reservation below through my Frito-Lay travel agency.  I think I
can probably book you another room at the same rate if you'd like.  This is 
for
the Marriott Capital for $129 a night.  The Sheraton rooms would have been 
$125
but they were sold out.  The Marriott is actually closer to the reception (2
blocks) than the Sheraton, so we'll be able to walk over.

Let me know and I'll try to get another room.

Ern
