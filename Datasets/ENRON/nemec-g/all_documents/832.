Attached is the final version of the Enron conf agrm.? Please run two 
originals for Dave Rogers. 

If time is of the essence, we can consider this to be my "electronic 
intitials" and we can have any VP in Houston sign off on it.? I can initial 
the hard copies when they circle back after signature by Enron.
