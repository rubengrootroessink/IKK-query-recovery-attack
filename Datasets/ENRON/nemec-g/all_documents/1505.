Cris,  

 Attached please find the Master Service Agreement and the 9 Service 
Schedules.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement and  Exhibits E-1, E-2, F, G, and 
H are attached below. Gerald Nemec will be forwarding the Schedules to the 
Purchase and Sale Agreement to you by E Mail.  We will be delivering hard 
copies of Exhibits  A and D, which are maps.  These documents will have minor 
revisions (i.e. notice addresses, dates etc.) but are otherwise in final 
form.  Please call with any questions.  Shonnie
