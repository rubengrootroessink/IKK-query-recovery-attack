Gerald,

I did receive the confirms and sent for signature.  Apparently there are
things going on between our corporate credit departments that I am not privy
to as yet.  I will let you know as soon as I hear anything.

Ann,  I have received your comments to the Enfolio and will review them.
Have you received the confirms for the Transaction and executed yet?
