Who has worked with Crescendo in addition to Craig Carver?  Despite Richard 
Sanders contact's reservations about Carver as a trial litigator, he marked 
up and helped negotiate over 20 PSA's for me over a 3 year time frame and I 
would recommend him.  He turns things quickly as well.

Steve,  We will probably use outside counsel that has worked with Crescendo 
before to handle this from Crescendo's perspective.  I will coordinate from 
ENA's perspective.  I am working with Teresa on this issue.

Can you review the PSA on Crescendo's behalf, or is this something Teresa 
Bushman or outside counsel should review?

I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie
Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to
send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal.

Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey
and Gerald.
Thx

Ken Krisa
