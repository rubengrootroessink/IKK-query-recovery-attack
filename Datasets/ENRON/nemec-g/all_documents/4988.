Gerald,

I am inquiring about the discounted rate letter for Global Contract No. 
96037453, which was forwarded to you on February 13, 2001.  


I need to know if you have completed review and initialed.  I was not certain 
if legal and the vice president should review and approve the discounted rate 
letters as well.  Pleas let me know.


Thank you.
