Subject: Happy Hour

Hello,

As you know I got your e-mail address from Dan Bump, we are trying to put a 
happy hour together for tomorrow.  I've got about 5 guys committed, and no 
girls, which is why we NEED you and all your friends.  Dan says you guys are 
a lot of fun but most importantly very HOT!  So, what are your plans tomorrow?
