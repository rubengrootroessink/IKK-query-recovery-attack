NOFX deliver punk with panache 
NOFX (House of Blues; 1,000 capacity; $22.50) 
By Troy J. Augusto 
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - If there's one band that modern punk-rock concert-goers 
can always count on for a good time, it's L.A.'s NOFX, whose fusion of 
musical influences and tightly delivered mix of humor and melody leaves most 
other bands in their dust. 
At the second of three sold-out House of Blues shows on Sunday, the 
three-chord quartet, which formed in the Bay Area in the mid-1980s, showed 
the result of years of nonstop touring by ripping through an action-packed 
hour-plus set. 
The all-ages gig featured a fan-approved selection of popular catalog songs 
(``Linoleum,'' ``Don't Call Me White,'' ``It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock 
Elite,'' ``The Brews'') from their many independently released albums and 
EPs, each generating the usual mosh-pit activities on the dance floor. (Venue 
security types were busy all night ejecting the rabble-rousers.) 
The set list was rounded out with a few choice cuts from last year's 
excellent ``Pack Up the Valuum'' (Epitaph) collection, like the twisted love 
tune ``Pharmacist's Daughter,'' about a guy who dates a girl so he can get 
drugs from her daddy, ``What's the Matter With Parents Today'' and 
``Louise,'' one of bassist-singer Fat Mike's many graphic tributes to 
lesbians. 
Besides the humor, band stands out from the pack with impressive vocal 
harmonies (even as they sing ``kill all the white man''), outstanding 
songwriting, and the players' aptitude on their instruments, not exactly a 
strength for most punk outfits. Four or five songs even boasted guitarist El 
Hefe blowing smooth on trumpet. 
Playful show ended with the new album's final track, ``Theme From a NOFX 
Album,'' an autobiographical party limerick with an ``oom-pah-pah'' flow that 
pretty much summed up the band's fortunes. ``We're professional punkers, we 
come from the suburbs, after 15 years we're still having fun.'' 
Presented inhouse. Band: Fat Mike, Eric Melvin, El Hefe, Erik Ghint. Opened 
Feb. 24, 2001, reviewed Feb. 25, closed Feb. 26.
