Hi Gerald:  ECT had ( expired 9/21/2000) an agreement with Western Gas 
Resources and Colorado Interstate Gas Company re Possible partnership, Joint 
venture, LLC or some other ownership or operating structure involving Western 
and CIG re design, construction and operation of gathering and transportation 
of coal bed methane produced in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming - dated 
9/21/98 for 2 years.

I don't find any current agreements with Colorado.
Kay
