Subject: Corp. Guaranty for Transco

Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation 
agreement.  We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not 
subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the 
Company's execution of the transportation agreements.

Please  review and let me know if you have questions.
