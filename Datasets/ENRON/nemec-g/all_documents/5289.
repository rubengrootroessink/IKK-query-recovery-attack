I note this e:mail from Jean Mrha regarding what looks like a potentially 
significant transaction.

Gerald,  I trust that you have contacted Jean by cellphone and worked out 
logistics of getting the CA reviewed.  Please feel free to call on Mary Ogden 
as a resource.

Barbara,  just wanted you to have a heads up on this in case you wanted to 
determine scope and provide whatever interface is appropriate with Lance's 
Group on a deal of this nature.  If this is a Bid situation it may be 
premature to say anything to them, but I know that's your call.

Thank.  Headed to the slopes this morning.  Can't wait!!

Steve

Jean,
I enjoyed talking to you today and look forward to working with you and
others in your group.  We're pleased that Enron is interested in pursuing
discussions with regard to a potential acquisition of Entergy's majority
interest in Highland Energy.

Attached is a draft confidentiality agreement.  If the agreement is
acceptable, please fill in the information for Enron, sign it and return to
me.  Otherwise, call me or John Denman (281-297-5325) to discuss any
revisions to the agreement.  Once the CA has been executed, we'll forward an
information memorandum on Highland to you.

Thank you for your expression of interest,
John
