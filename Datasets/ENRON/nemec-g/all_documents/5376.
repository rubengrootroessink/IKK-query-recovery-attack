If X is not able to permanently assign or release the Capacity to ENA 
hereunder due to no fault of either Party, X shall maximize the value of the 
Capacity awarded to it and shall mitigate the demand charges associated with 
the Capacity or any unused portion of same, acting reasonably (the "Mitigated 
Recovery"), and in such case ENA shall make a compensating payment to X, 
within 30 days after the end of the Term, equal to the positive difference 
between the Tariff Rate less the amount of the Mitigated Recovery.
