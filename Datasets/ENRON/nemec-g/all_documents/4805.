Hi Ryan,

No vacation necessary for the Flower Gardens!  We report to the boat around
9:00 pm on Friday evening and return to dock around 6:00 pm on Sunday.  The
most spots currently available are on the February trip from the 23rd-25th.

If you have access to the internet, check out the trip specifics on my
website.  Go to www.scubadoobydoo.com.  Click on Dive Calendar and then on
the Flower Gardens link in the table.

I need full payment for the Feb trip due on Sun, Feb 4th  (this weekend)
although if you let me know the checks in the mail, I won't release the
spots.

If you want more info, please give me a call.  Hope to SEA you soon,
Kristi
