Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for 
great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  
With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit 
goals available to employees.  

Please take a few minutes to review our 2001 goals on Enron's intranet at

dedication, we can realize another year of stellar performance.
