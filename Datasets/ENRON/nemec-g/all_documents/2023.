Hey Melissa,

I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow.
We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review
about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I
guess I'll get through them.

Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and
at the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold
my tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.

We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next
Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type
you told me at lunch!

Take care,

Gerald
