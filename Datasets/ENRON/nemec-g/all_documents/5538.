Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on 
your credit worksheet.  I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a 
different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we 
would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.  

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
