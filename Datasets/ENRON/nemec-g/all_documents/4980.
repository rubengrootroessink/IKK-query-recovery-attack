Steal industry
Feb 1st 2001 | NEW YORK
From The Economist print edition=20

ON THE face of it, the bankruptcy of a steelmaker, LTV, is another sad stor=
y=20
about a once-dominant company in a once-mighty industry. Though its $2=20
billion of debts are not trivial, the case would have got little attention=
=20
but for a nuance in LTV=01,s bankruptcy filing in an Ohio court that has al=
armed=20
some of the world=01,s biggest lenders.
The crux of the issue is whether a desperate plea for money that the court =
is=20
hearing this week will undermine one of the great acts of financial alchemy=
=20
in recent years: to wit, cheap financing for bad creditors. Reams of papers=
=20
have been filed by two of LTV=01,s main creditors, Chase Manhattan Bank (no=
w=20
merged with J.P. Morgan) and Abbey National, a British bank. An adverse=20
ruling from the court would be a blow to plenty of other banks.
Behind the litigation are LTV=01,s efforts in the early 1990s to fund a=20
capital-intensive business as cheaply as an earlier bankruptcy in 1986 and=
=20
difficult operating conditions would allow. The solution, which has been=20
applied by too many other American companies to count, was to create a coup=
le=20
of special-purpose vehicles=01*essentially, independent legal entities. The=
se=20
were supposedly insulated from the risk of their parent going bankrupt. The=
=20
first of these vehicles contained LTV=01,s receivables (what it was owed by=
=20
customers), and the second its inventory (piles of steel). LTV would inject=
=20
assets into these entities, paid for by attractively priced asset-backed=20
loans. The size of these loan facilities last year, according to Standard &=
=20
Poor=01,s, was about $650m, or equivalent to slightly more than half of LTV=
=01,s=20
total long-term debt.
When LTV filed for bankruptcy on December 29th, everything seemed normal (i=
f=20
normality is an empty till and 18,000 employees wondering whether they have=
 a=20
job). Alarms started ringing at the commercial banks when it became clear=
=20
that LTV was going to argue in court that it could use as it liked (ie, not=
=20
necessarily to repay interest and principal on the asset-backed loans) the=
=20
money got from receivables=01*since, it claimed, the original transfer of t=
he=20
receivables to the special-purpose vehicles was not a sale but a =01&disgui=
sed=20
finance transaction=018. The alarms rang louder when the judge appeared to =
be=20
sympathetic to LTV=01,s arguments. The case continues. If the judge rules i=
n LTV=01,
s favour, there will be intense pain and embarrassment at many banks.
