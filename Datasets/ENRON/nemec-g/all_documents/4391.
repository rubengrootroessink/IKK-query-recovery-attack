FYI.  Looks like a real circle jerk.

Have the current documents come in yet?  No.  Do I understand correctly that 
all of the documents (6 plus amendments) that John McEwen forwarded us have 
been replaced by new versions?  No, I'm not sure.  Some of the documents have 
changed, we'll have to wait to get the operative documents from ReUse to see 
which documents have changed.

Dwight,

Have the current documents come in yet?  Do I understand correctly that all 
of the documents (6 plus amendments) that John McEwen forwarded us have been 
replaced by new versions?  I'd like to have read through the latest deal 
before Thursday.

Thanks,

Steve

Will you get us a conference room for this meeting.  We are probably going to 
have around 7 to 10 people.

I have confirmed Dec 21st at 1:30 in Houston with Kris Johnson and Virgil 
Hutchinson to start discussing the renegotiation/extension of the coal and 
ash handling agreements for both the Lumberton and Elizabethtown plants.

Kris is going to Fedex to us:
 1) the most current agreements with Cogentrix re the Facilities (apparently 
we don't have the most recent documents).
 2) the current property tax records 
 3) a recent environmental assessment that ReUse had done.
