This spreadsheet corrects the graph in the previously submitted spreadsheet, 
removing the last two data points.
Data is only through June 2000, and the graph incorrectly also showed the 
average numbers as if they were numbers for July and August 2000.

The attached is a monthy table w/ a summary of line pressures and production.
Take a look and see if this is what you need.
Notice the sheet called "Summary by month and average", especially the last 
few columns with averages calculated.

Remember, most of the Entrada Production went off-line beginning in 1998, 
with final production in August 99.
Call me @ 3-1888 if we need to discuss.
