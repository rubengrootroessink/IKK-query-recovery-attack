Did we ever come to terms with Conoco regarding the requested changes to our 
contract # 96023191?  I got a copy of a Confirmation for the Data Room from 
Eric but I still show the contract as being not executed.  Did the 
Confirmation # 96019743 get sent to Conoco or is it part of the contract 
language issue? 

I'll be out of the office until Monday.  Thanks for any information you may 
have regarding Conoco.

Jackie
