Gerald,

We have been unofficially informed that the bids are due back on February
9 - I was hoping to be ready one week earlier than that.  I am trying to get
the total package to ENA mid next week.  I have not yet even looked at the
package.  TBI mentioned that mark-ups to the PSA and the gathering agreement
for TBI reserves (you should also have a copy of it from Audrey) would be
considered heavily in the bid evaluation process. Therefore, I would like to
keep the changes to those required and not "cosmetic" or "druthers".  We
will need to review both contracts.  I will try to get the TBI gas gathering
agreement as an electronic file today.

Thx

Ken

What is the time frame? This agreement looks to need significant revisions.

I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie
Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to
send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal.

Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey
and Gerald.
Thx

Ken Krisa
