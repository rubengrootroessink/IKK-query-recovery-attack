Gerald. a couple of comments/questions:

1.  Why are there references to fixed volumes referenced (Section 1.6, 
Section 2.1)?  These contracts, I thought, were to be truly varaiable,swing, 
best efforts, interrruptible type contracts.

2. I need to understand the mechanism for determining the "Variable"Services 
Fee.  It looks like to me that it is really fixed, based upon the underlying 
rate in the referenced gathering agreements.  Are those underlying rates 
variable or fixed?  It would be better from an accounting perspective not to 
have referenced contracts, but rather just have a market based, negotiated 
monthly and variable, transportation rate.
