Following up on an original request dated January 31, 2000:

Bridgeline Holdings LLC currently provides a $15MM guaranty to Cinergy 
Marketing & Trading, L.L.C.  Exposures have increased to $27MM and they have 
requested we provide them with an Enron/Texaco guaranty to make up the 
difference.  Therefore, could you please prepare two new guaranties for this 
counterparty, each with a cap of $15MM, and forward them both by e-mail to me 
for my records.  Also, if you could print and intial a hardcopy ENE guaranty 
and forward it to EB2860b I would appreciate it.

thanks
brant
