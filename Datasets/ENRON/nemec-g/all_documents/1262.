Following up on the discussion in our staff meeting today, I am forwarding 
information that Sandi requested of Cheryl Dudley this morning.  Please 
review the attached spreadsheet listing of "Top 10" purchase, sale and 
transport contracts and call Sandi if you have any knowledge as to why Cheryl 
Dudley might not be able to find executed contracts for any of those 
transactions.  Please note that the list below is NOT the listing of Top 10 
contracts; you'll have to open and look at the spreadsheet.   

If you know that a transaction is in some stage of negotiation, it would be 
helpful to send Sandi the latest draft of the relevant contract.  It would 
also be helpful to know "the story" of why the contract is not yet 
completed,  Please call Sandi in the morning (or me) if you have any 
questions.  Thanks for your help in getting this significant matter addressed.

Attached are the files that I received to use in pulling the contracts for 
the Data Room.  I was never given any lists of just the top 10 
purchase/sales/transportation customers.  I believe that those lists were 
used to come up with the contract lists that I was given and that those 
customers are included in the top 25 of each type of contract.  Melissa 
Graves or George Weissman might be able to help with the "Top 10 Customers".




Since I couldn't find "paper" for some of the original 25 purchase, sales & 
transportation contracts, I continued down the list until I actually had 
"paper" for 25 of each.
Below is the listing of those additional contracts.

Today I met with Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, etc. & we are trying to get 
"paper" for the 5 transportation, 7 purchase & 8 sales that "fell off" the 
first go-round of the document production.  If we are able to get all of 
those, the additional contracts that I pulled won't be needed any longer.  
(Even though the decision was made to go ahead & leave them in the Data Room.)

If you need anything else, please let me know.
