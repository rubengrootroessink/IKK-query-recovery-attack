I hear that you are going to Spain during the Thanksgiving Holidays? When
are you going and where are you going. Sounds like a good trip give us the
details before you leave huh!!!!
           We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We
really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full
effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and
Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.
   James came over the other day and I was keeping Jacob, so I let them draw
names for Christmas you have James's name and they didn't cheat either
Ha..... well all for now Dad and I send our love hope all is going
well........Love MOM
