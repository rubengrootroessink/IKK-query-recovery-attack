Dear Gerald Nemec, 

We're proud to announce another first from Datek Online: we're 
the first major online brokerage firm to successfully introduce 
"penny-wise" trading in decimals. This enhancement is made 
possible in partnership with The Island ECN. 

What is decimalized trading and why is it important?

First, the what. Most everybody feels that it's easier to work 
in dollars and cents than it is to do calculations in fractions. 
"Decimalization" is simply a fancy word for the financial markets' 
switch from cumbersome fractions to an easy-to-understand 
decimal system. 

Now the "Why is it important?" part. Datek Online has led the charge 
to trading in decimals because we believe that: 

?????It is an investment advantage that is long overdue. Datek Online 
?????is providing the momentum we believe is needed to speed adoption 
?????of this improvement, industry-wide. 

?????Trading in decimals allows investors to potentially gain 
?????significant priority advantages.

?????Looking ahead, orders made in smaller increments should lead to 
?????narrower spreads, more efficient markets and lower trading costs.

When could a penny ever get you so much? 

Visit our Learning Center for more information on trading 
in decimals. 

Any Datek Online account you open now will give you the ability to 
trade in either decimals or fractions. The choice is yours! Click 
here to complete your application. 

Sincerely, 

Datek Online Brokerage Services, LLC

High volumes of trading and volatility may result in executions at 
prices significantly away from the price quoted or displayed at the 
time of order entry. 

System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, 
system performance and other factors. Trading in decimals applies to 
Nasdaq securities only, which are represented on the Island ECN, an 
affiliated broker-dealer.
