Agree.  Would you please draft the letter?  Thank you.  Also, I haven't
heard from Wildhorse or Tom Brown today as to when the deal will close.
Hope it occurred today.

Ken Krisa

Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to
curtail our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the
letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event
that Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to
NWPL, we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's
damages.  Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que
obligation to move it there.

From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our
protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause
problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing
to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.

Joan, Gerald:
I am wondering whether we need to send another letter as we did for the
October Nominations - to continue to show our intent to nominate 100% of
gas
to NWPL.  I think this may take some more thought - as I don't want to be
given the nomination and then curtailed 50% as other producers are.

Ken

The noms can only be done via the internet if we have a Wildhorse/NWPL
transport contract number.  And as far as I know, they still will not give
us one.  So, we can either : 1) obtain the Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number from Tom Brown and nom via the internet to NWPL; 2) if not,
nom via internet into Questar and fax letter; or 3) fax nom to Questar,
along with letter.

Mark - what do you think our chances of getting a Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number are?

We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if
Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to
Questar solely to mitigate damages.  I can draft the appropriate letter.

Joan or Ken,

Will the nominations be done via the web site?  Do we have the information
to nominate to NWPL via the website?

Joan, Gerald;

What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through
the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate
on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement
that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal?

Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get
their late last Friday.

Ken Krisa
