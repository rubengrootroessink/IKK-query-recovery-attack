Thanks so much Gerald!  I have been trying to get all our responses down as
well, so this will definitely help.  I hope we can wrap this up soon.  Again
I apologize for the delay on our end as well.

Ann,  Sorry for not getting back to you on this.  I have some answers on
the issues that were on my to do list.  It might make the most sense for me
to comment in response to your memo dated March 8, and forward to you.  I
know there were several items that you were checking with your people and I
would note those.  Let me know what you think.

Hello Gerald,

I just wanted to drop you a line to apologize for not getting the letter
response out to you.

Do you know if Russell contacted the Canadian office about issuing the
Canadian draft agreements for review and finalization with the U.S.
contracts?  I thought that was his intent, but we have received nothing as
yet.

Have a wonderful Easter holiday!

I will try to address first thing next week.

Talk to you then.

Tx.

Ann
