Ms. Ward,

With respect to our potential transaction,  we are anticipating sending your
company financials and would typically have a confidentiality agreement with
respect to that disclosure.  I am attaching the Client's standard
Confidentiality Agreement.  It is my experience that suppliers typicall have
ones that they are comfortable with and prefer to sign their own.  If that
is the case, please ignore ours and send us yours.  If that is not the case,
please have ours reviewed and changes suggested so that we may forward to
you the information you will eventually need for credit purposes.  In
addition, if you have standard credit provisions or terms, please forward
those today or tommorrow so that we may prepare what we need to for your
review.

Greg Lander
