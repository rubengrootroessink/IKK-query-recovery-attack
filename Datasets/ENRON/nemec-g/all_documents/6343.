Hi guys, I will be sending your tickets to Cabo very soon.  You decided not
to take Kennedy Scareways, huh?

You all (and John)  will be leaving out of Denver on Air Mexicana on
Thursday, July 5th at 2:35 pm. You will arrive in Cabo at 5:35 pm. It's
non-stop.  You will return on Sunday, July 8. You will leave Cabo at 10:30
am and arrive in Denver at 1:15 pm.

Houston to Cabo flights were very full, and in fact we were lucky to find
this one.
Gerald Nemec will leave Houston on AeroMexico on Thursday, July 5th at 12:20
pm and arrive in Mexico City at 2:40 pm. He will depart Mexico City at 4:35
and arrive in Cabo at 5:35 pm.  He will leave Cabo on July 8th at 12:35 pm
arriving in Mexico City at 3:35 pm. He will depart Mexico City at 4:25pm and
arrive in Houston at 6:30 pm.

Denver and Houston will arrive in Cabo at the same time!  The return, Gerald
will leave two hours later than you .

If Gerald is unhappy with this schedule, out travel agent's phone number is:
1-800-294-0862. Her name is Wendy.

If I can help, give me a call.

Karen
