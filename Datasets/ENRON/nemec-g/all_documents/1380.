Roger,

Currently we have the following issues outstanding with Merrick which will or 
may impact the final cost of the
project:

 Change Orders:
 -Change in the CIG tie-in point. CO approved for $66,375
 -Move plant inlet and outlet flanges for blinding. CO not received, expected 
to be about $40,000.
 -As-built survey for the plant.  Change just requested, expected to be about 
$3,000.

 Notices of Force Majeure:
 -March 13, various archaeological sites.
 March 28 Jeffery City archaeological site.
 -April 3, Buffalo Creek archaeological site.
 These notices state that there is a potential cost and/or schedule impact 
for these sites.  The
 pipeline was placed in service by the date required under the contract, so 
there is no schedule   impact.   We have not received any notice that there 
has been a cost impact.

 Liquidated Damages:
 -The pipeline was ready for service and was flowing gas by August 31, so 
there are no liquidated   damages associated with the pipeline.  The 
in-service date for the plant was extended to    September 4.  Work is still 
in progress on the plant and we will determine the status on September   4.

I do not know of any other issues at this time, but once facilities are 
completed we will need to conduct final inspections and run tests before 
acceptance.

I am sending you copies of the Change Order that we have received and the 
Notices of Force Majeure.

Lal
