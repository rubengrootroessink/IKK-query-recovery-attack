Gerald,  Upon your review please forward any comments to me and Mike Smith.  
After meeting with Mark Knippa this morning, we are targeting tomorrow 
morning (12/7/00) for execution of the master agreement.

In addition to the Master, I will forward you the TA as it relates to the 
Blackwater deal later today.  EES plans to present executable pricing for 
Blackwater as early as tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks

Bo

Here is a clean (12-4) and a new redline against the ECS version 12-1.  If 
you approve, you can send to ECS.
