Your clause is not as finely tuned as it could be, but it is difficult to=
=20
give you exactly the precise wording to make it more finely tuned because i=
t=20
exists in a context of a number of related provisions in the Master=20
Agreement.  Here is how I would ultimately like to see the clause work:

After calculation of a Termination Payment in accordance with Section ___, =
if=20
the Defaulting Party would be owed the Termination Payment, the=20
Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled, at its option and in its discretion=
,=20
to (i) set off against such Termination Payment any amounts due and owing b=
y=20
the Defaulting Party or any of its Affiliates to the Non-Defaulting Party o=
r=20
any of its Affiliates under any other natural gas, energy or other commodit=
y=20
or financial agreements, instruments or undertakings  between the Defaultin=
g=20
Party or any of its Affiliates and the Non-Defaulting Party or any of its=
=20
Affiliates and/or (ii) to the extent the Transactions are not yet liquidate=
d=20
in accordance with Section ___, withhold payment of the Termination Payment=
=20
to the Defaulting Party.  =20

If you could get whoever is helping you with your deal to work these concep=

into the gas agreement you would be much better protected by the clause tha=

you are with the one you just sent me. ---cgy

The following provisions are proposed to be added into the Confirms for the=

If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set=

amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under=

an individual) that, directly or indirectly, through one or more=20
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control=
