Gerald,

The date the 30 day public comment period started for the revised Hoe Creek 
location was August 12, 2000.  We can expect to have the new permit in hand 
the 2nd or 3rd week in September.

The attachment is the punchlist we discussed last night that outlines what 
party is responsible for making what notification to the DEQ and when it is 
required.  I have discussed this at some length with both Hanover and Radian 
and all parties have bought off on this for at least the time being.

The exact status of where we are with each individual machine is still being 
prepared.  This will take a little more time.  Call if any questions.  Thanks

Ken
