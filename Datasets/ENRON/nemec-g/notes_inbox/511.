Question for you guys - because of our past experience and situation I wanted 
to have you guys let me know what to do on insurance.

The Gillette office is going to lease a 4 wheel drive vehicle for 1 month.  
The lease is through Enterprise and they are asking if we want them to add 
insurance.  Enron doesn't have a corporate rate for Enterprise.  I don't want 
to assume anything so should we have them add it or not?  

I am checking into trying to lease from Avis because we do have a rental 
agreement with them.

Thanks

Jessica
