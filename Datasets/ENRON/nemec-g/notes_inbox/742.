I see $498 rt from des moines to madrid on northwest
and $423 rt from houston to madrid on continental
that appears to me to be available on the dates we want . . . without
using priceline . . .
have you used up all your attempts on priceline eric?  if so, so you
want me to try from here?  what prices were you trying to bid?

** I also don't see a flight from omaha to houston on Continental for
those dates --- do you know if continental has stopped flying to omaha?
there are other carriers, but none direct.  just wondering.
