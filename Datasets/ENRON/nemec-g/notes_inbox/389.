Ann:

 I think you can change your mind on requests for early termination
short of withdrawing and re-filling, but I don't know for sure what the
procedure would be.  I have had gone through situations the other way, where
we have filed with an ET request and then changed our minds and withdrawn
the request, and we have done this with a letter.  I left Mike Verne a voice
mail message just to ask him the procedure, but have not heard back.  I'll
let you know.

I'm being told that maybe the parties don't want to ask for early
termination on this HSR filing.  If they change their mind after they file,
do they have to withdraw and refile, or can they amend their filing?  Also,
I was asked to possibly file on Friday instead of Monday.
