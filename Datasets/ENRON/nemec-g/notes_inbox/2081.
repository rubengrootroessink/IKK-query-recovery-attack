Sounds good Gerald,

If you can make it tomorrow at noon - EB3567 - it would be great.  Basically, 
we plan to review the highlights of the contract (and the LOI) and I'm sure 
you could help with that.  It won't take more than an hour.  If not, I 
certainly understand.

Talk to you tomorrow - and thanks,

Andrew
