Okay, we're meeting up with your fellas tonight.......anything I need to
know in advance??  Have they had all of their shots?  I'm kinda feeling
some pressure to be "fun as well as hot".   Actually, I talked to Paul this
morning and he sounds really funny and nice.   It'll be interesting for
you because you'll get to hear the guys' version as well as the girls!  You
know I'll be bribing you to find out what they really say!


have a great weekend and just know we'll be talking about you tonight!
