Hey, good to hear from you.  I figured as much about you being able to
attend.  It sounds like work is taken over your life.

No, I've not been keeping Mark on line, I am busy dating so I have not seem
him as much.

I'll keep in touch as long as you don't become a stranger! ;o)

Take care, Patricia
