Eric,
 Please see if you can dust the cobwebs of of this one and get it pushed 
through for me.  We are approaching year's end and I have been operating 3 
qtrs without an agreement.

Perry,

I wanted another set of eyes (Gerald Nemec's) to take a look at it before we 
signed off on it.  I spoke with Gerald today about it.  I believe it got 
buried and he hasn't looked at it yet.  He'll try to take a look at it this 
week.

Thanks,

Eric,
 What is the status of this agreement.  The last I remember is that it was 
redlined and forwarded on for final acceptance.

Perry
