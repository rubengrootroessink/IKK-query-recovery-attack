Molly,

I appreciate your assistance on this matter.  The start date will work fine.  
I did speak with Rae and she mentioned the vacation matter and I told her 
that we would be able to work with her on that as it occurs following the 
expected closing of a major transaction that our legal group is working on.

Looking forward to Rae's arrival

As you probably know by now (since Rae wanted to call you herself), she has 
accepted our offer of employment.  Her anticipated start date is Monday, 
April 30.    I don't know whether she took the opportunity when she talked 
with you this morning to mention her vacation plans.  She would like the last 
week of June off (6/25-6/29); in fact, she has purchased non-refundable 
tickets for that trip.   I told her that I felt sure that you would be quite 
happy to work with her about her plans....

Thanks,
Molly
