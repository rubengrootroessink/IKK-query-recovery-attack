Gerald,

This is fantastic.  Exactly what we wanted.  I'll have to change some of the 
wording in the Article 1:3 section to reflect what we are actually basing the 
benchmark on.  It isn't a simple, one day price, it is actually a multi-year 
swap price beginning on the start date of the agreement.  I'll make those 
changes and get it back to you.

Andrew
