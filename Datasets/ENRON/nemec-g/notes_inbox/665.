Shonnie,
 
Status as I know it:
 
 Purchase Agreement -  I requested a couple of revisions over the weekend.  
Your most recent revisions OK.
    Need final document for execution.
 Administrative Agreement - We anticipate obtaining all signatures today.
 Master Services and Schedules - This is in final form and ready for 
execution, isn't it?
 Assignment and Assumption Agmts,  Purchaser's Officer's Certificate and 
Guaranty - Need in final form for execution,   i.e. without "Exhibit" 
language.

 We are still working with Jason Peters on the credit support package and 
certificates. 
  
 
 Thanks.  Eva.
