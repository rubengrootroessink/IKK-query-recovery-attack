Attached is a draft of a letter that we would like to send to Barclays laying 
out the items/requests associated with Conversion.

Gerald:  could you take a look at the descriptions associated with the 
Amendments to the Gas Gathering Agreements and the Admin Services Agmt. and 
make corrections if necessary.

Audrey:  Could you please provide a short summary of the construction status 
(one to two paragraphs)

Dean:  if I have missed out on anything please include them

Katie:  Could you create Attachment A as described in the letter.

Thanks

Ranabir
