I wanted to send you this Timber Management Agreement.  I just put a hard 
copy of it on your chair.  I will come by later, so that we can discuss it 
and you can tell me what changes you would like me to make.

Ignore the Demand Letter Attachment.  I accidentally attached the timber 
management agreement.
