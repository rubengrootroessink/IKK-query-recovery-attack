This committee is just gearing up this year.  The committee chair is Veta
Byrd at Vinson & Elkins.  She is probably the person best equipped to answer
your questions about the program.  Her phone number is 713-758-2222.

Hello,  I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp.  I have recently been
asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.  Monica Jordan previously
had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority
Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.

I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it
operates, when it meets. etc.  Any information you could supply would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Gerald Nemec
