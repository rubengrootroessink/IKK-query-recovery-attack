Debelah Morgan!  She is really big in the Hip Hop world.  Come on....get with
the times here Gerald.

I am going to try and get out of here around 4:00.  I need to go get my car
washed, etc.  I am supposed to hear from Susie about that time.  She will
then let me know what time she is going to be downtown.  I hope you will come
along even if no one else wants to join in!  I know that a lot of people from
work are going to be out and about tonight, too.

You know we actually need to start spending time together outside of the
alcohol.  At least a little earlier than 10:00 at night.  I really don't even
know if I like you.  Ha! Ha!

Well, I looked at my work schedule and those dates should work.  I just need
to talk to Judi.  We will be in the middle of month end, but I am thinking
that everything could be finished by that time.

I'll talk with you in a little bit!
