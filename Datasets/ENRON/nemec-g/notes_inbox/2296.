G,

Thanks for the offer for  help. I am coming into town around 8:30 p.m. I
will call you as soon as we get in. I am going to have Heather take me to
your casa or near it. Maybe we can meet somewhere. Heather has a shower to
go to manana so I am free until then. I am thirsty for some adult beverages.
My number is 512-496-3997. I will talk to later this evening.

GT
