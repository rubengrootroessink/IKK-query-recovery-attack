We missed you guys at the demo on Tuesday.  I had some questions on the OUA & 
password application: 

 1) On the HPL Online password application:  I would be in favor of not 
including the check verification regarding exchange or view access.  
 2) On the OUA:  In the third & fourth paragraph on page 1, it mentions that 
counterparty has an existing transportation service      contract with HPL.  
Some Operators on HPL may not have a service agreement with HPL.  It also 
mentions service contracts in section #1 and   section #4.
 3) On the OUA:  In section #7 - Confidentiality, a reference is made to 
6(b).  I could not find a 6(b) anywhere in the document.  Also in section 
#8    - General, a reference is made to 6(e) and 7(e).  I could not find 
either anywhere. 

Other than the above items, both doc's look real good.  thanks for your help.
