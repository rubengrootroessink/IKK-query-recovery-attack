Puto,

What's going on dude? Antigua was awesome. I survived it without a problem.
Heather moving in has been a different story. I didn't realize how much
"stuff" you could pack into a one bedroom apartment. How is your love life.
The gal from the wedding was pretty hot. Are you still chasing that? Lets
get together soon. Our extra bedroom is nicer now. My old bed got tossed in
a dumpster. It smelled like shit.

Talk to you later
GT
