Per our recent discussions, I am sending you this e-mail to cover the conte=
nt=20

Santiago, CHILE

We need the CA to cover a contemplated structured transaction between "Enro=

As for the Engagement Letter, I would use a similar format to the previous=

letter and make sure that it has the following steps outlined:

* The effective date of the engagement will start upon signature.
* ENAP will use best efforts to submit to Enron all of the information that=
=20

revised request for data upon execution of this letter agreement.
* Enron will use best efforts to submit an initial proposal within 30 days=
=20
thereafter and develop definitive agreements with ENAP within 90 days from=
=20
the date that Enron had received the data from ENAP.

This should target us to close on a transaction on or around September 1,=
=20
2001.

Please develop these agreements and I will call you later today or tomorrow=
