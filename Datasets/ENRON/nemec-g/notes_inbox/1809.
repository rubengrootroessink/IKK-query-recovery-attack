Like lasting friendships or a cool breeze at the end of the day in the hot    
Texas sun, for the King Ranch cowboy, owning and giving leather goods that 
are practical as well as beautiful has become one of life's simple pleasures. 
Below are a few examples that will make your travel trouble-free.

Our Armstrong 22" JOURNEYMAN encapsulates all of the quality and distinction 
of King Ranch Saddle Shop and offers easy mobility through any airport.
The Armstrong TRAVELER is just one piece in this collection that represents 
all of the simple pleasures in life! The ideal weekend traveler bag.

The King Ranch Chaparral Luggage Collection reflects those days when Rangers 
would pack their bags and take long trips by horse or train in their search 
either for outlaws, or just a quiet, romantic place to spend the night.

Our 22" TROLLEY BAG epitomizes the change from the 19th to the 20th century 
when early lawmen and businessmen needed something substantial to tote their 
belongings. This rolling suitcase combines luxury with mobility for your 
voyage.
The CONESTOGA DUFFEL (17", 20", or 23") combines the versatility of Old West 
travel and the exquisite style of today's traveler. With three sizes to 
choose from, there is one suited for your journey.
