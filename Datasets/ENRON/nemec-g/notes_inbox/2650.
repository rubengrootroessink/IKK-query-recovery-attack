FYI,

I have no doubt that this deal will heat up on December 28 or 29.

Stephanie,

Here is a revised version of the Term Sheet which follows the pricing 
approach we discussed earlier today.  Let me know what you think.

I am expecting Calpine's response to the term letter we sent last week  to 
arrive shortly. I already know that they wanted to strengthen the "first 
look" provision and have a reopener on the price after a two year period. 

Can you please review attached? Comments/suggestions?

Please call
