Dwight,

Do you have any idea what UNUM is or what Justine Elmore's e:mail means. 
Would you call Dee to figure it out?

Thanks,

Steve

Could one of you get the right person (a rep. of the new company or I would 
do it myself) to reply to Justin's request?  

Thank you,
Dee

Hello Dee,

UNUM has asked for written confirmation that the Alamack group will have
nothing to do with the selling company and that we have authority to act on
behalf of the new group as their consultant.  They are looking for this
quickly.  I think that a reply to this email will suffice.  Thanks.
