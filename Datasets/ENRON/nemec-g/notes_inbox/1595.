Eric, Here's Jon's latest email.  

Yo Ma:

Yep, I'll fax the hotel today or tomorrow and let them know our lodging
dates. I've already received the lodging dates from the Brouwers and
Rasmussens.

Ai Ping and I are doing fine. The weather in Wuxi the last week has been
heavenly. The wedding planning is going ok. It will all hopefully take shape
in the next month. The post-wedding travel planning will be done during this
period also, we have to wait to purchase plane tickets, etc.

Hope you liked the wedding invitations. The Chinese don't have special
wedding invitations printed for themselves. They just buy them and write out
the details. Fine with me. I didn't include RSVP details because it seemed
pointless: everybody who's planning to come to the wedding already knows
about it. The others don't need to write back and tell me they can't come.

Go ahead and bring Ai Ping's parents a small gift- that would be nice. It
needn't be big, or expensive, just something to let them know you're happy
to meet them.

Glad to hear that Uncle Darrel and Grandpa Jack were able to come over for
Easter dinner. Should I mail them wedding invitations? I don't want to
exclude them from the process just because they can't attend the wedding.

Sounds like the trip to Beijing will be a circus. That's fine: there is
power in numbers. When we're gawked at we can return in unison open-mouthed
expressions of befuddlement. We'll be a parade of big-noses. We should
charge admission.

Hope all is great in FF. Good luck finishing up the grad class. Take care!

Love,

Jon
