RE:     Online CLE Seminars Available in March


As a fellow Texas legal professional, I would like to apprise you of the
following CLEonline.com seminars taking place in the month of March,
in which you or some of your colleagues or associates may be interested.
All of these seminars are fully accredited for PARTICIPATORY CLE credits
(not self-study) by the State Bar of Texas, and all are open and available,
24-hours a day, through the last day of this month.

    There is NO LIMIT on the number of CLE credits you can earn

    sacrificing valuable time away from your practice.
