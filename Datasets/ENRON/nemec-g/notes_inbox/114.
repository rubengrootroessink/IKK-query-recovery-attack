Attached is my attempt at the clause making the counterparty liable for any 
decisions that they make concerning the timber services without our 
approval.   I have not been able to find the address on Lexis, so I will keep 
looking.  Also, the italicized portions are the ones that you had questions 
on.  I just wanted to know if Ms. Bywaters ever sent answers to those 
questions to you, because I can make those changes, also.
