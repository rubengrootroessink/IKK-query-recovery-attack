Brant,
 
Angie Forman has referred your form Guaranty to my attention  for review and 
comment.  I have incorporated our requested changes,  additions, etc., into a 
redline draft of the guaranty and attach the same with  this e-mail for your 
review.  Once you have had an opportunity to review  the redline document, 
please contact me with any comments or questions you may  have.  Thanks, 
Brant.
