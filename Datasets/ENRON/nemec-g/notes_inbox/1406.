I received the following request for changes from Avista Steag through Pace 
Global for the Brazos Valley Project Interconnection Agreement.  Please 
review and comment:

Item 2.   Engineering, Design and Construction:
In the fourth line, after the words " ...sound and prudent natural gas....",  
add the phrase "and with sound and prudent natural gas pipeline" industry 
practice'  .

Item 5ii. Quality Specification and Measurement:
In the second line, after the words "...to the Standards.", add the phrase 
"and with sound and prudent natural gas pipeline industry practice".

Item 9.  Term.
Delete the paragraph on term and add the following:  "This Agreement shall be 
effective as of thes date herein writtten above and shall remain in full 
force and effect for a primary term of twenty years ("Primary Term"), and 
shall continue in full force and effect thereafter so long as there is an 
agreement in effect that provides for the delivery or receipt of gas by or 
for HPL or its affiliate(s) or designee(s) at or through the Delivery Point 
("Transportation Agreement"); provided, that after the Primary Term of this 
Agreement, upon the expiration or termination of any such Transportation
