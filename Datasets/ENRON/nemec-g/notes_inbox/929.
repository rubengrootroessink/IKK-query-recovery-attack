Gerald,

I finally got a chance to review the GTC and am sending you my suggested 
wording changes and questions in the attached.  Most of the changes I'm 
suggesting are driven by the changes that I think should be made to the 
Breach of Obligations and Remedies Section.  Let's find some time Monday 
morning to discuss.

I looked at the Product Description but did not make any changes because I 
think I need a better understanding of its use and legal effect.  The main 
thing I'm concerned about is its looking like a contract for the brokering of 
capacity, as opposed to the description of a means for executing a capacity 
release transaction with a Pipeline.  Let's discuss.

Steve

Attached for review are a draft of the GTC and Product Description for the 
transport capacity transactions on EOL.  Please review and provide comments.

Carl, If you want to meet to discuss, just let me know when.
