I was forwarded this website....Try it out!  Kind of funny...something to pay
with when you need a break from work.

Call me when you get home.  I am actually running earlier than I thought.
Micah and I were supposed to run later, but that changed!  I will have
already taken my shower and have the dogs walked by the time you get home.
Talk with you in a little bit!
