Hello Gerald,

Just a follow up note on the status of the review of our comments on the new
ENFOLIO.  Please give me a call or drop me a note.  I hope we can get the
contract settled.

I still have not heard what is happening with the credit side.  I have not
received signed confirms as yet.

Regards,

Ann
