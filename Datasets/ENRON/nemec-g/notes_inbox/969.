Scheduled by Buyer hereunder for the term of this Agreement. Buyer shall have 
all the rights, obligations, duties and responsibilities attributable to 
Shipper under the Gas Gathering Agreement for the quantity of Gas Scheduled 
by Buyer hereunder and Buyer does hereby expressly assume the Gas Gathering 
Agreement for the term hereof in all respects for the quantity of Gas 
Scheduled by Buyer hereunder except as to (i) the Reserve Dedication 
contained in Section 2.1, the Right of Way grant contained in Section 11.1 
and the warranties of Shipper contained in Section 9.1 of the Gas Gathering 
Agreement, all of which shall be and remain wholly the obligations of Seller 
and (ii) with regard to Section 3.2 Fixed Gathering Fee, Buyer shall only 
assume and be responsible for that amount of the Fixed Gathering Fee (as

and responsibilities of Seller under the Gas Gathering Agreement not assigned 
to Buyer hereunder, including for the quantity of Seller's Gas, other than or

payment obligations attributable to the term of this partial assignment. 
Neither Buyer or Seller shall have the right to amend the Gas Gathering 
Agreement during the term hereof without the consent of the other party 
(Buyer or Seller as the case may be).  This partial assignment of Gas 
Gathering Agreement shall run with this Agreement and shall be likewise 
Assigned to any assignee of this Agreement.
