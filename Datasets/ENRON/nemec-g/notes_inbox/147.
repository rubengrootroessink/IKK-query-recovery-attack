Dear Gerald Nemec, 

Datek Online now offers Bulletin Board stocks to meet the needs of 
investors with aggressive investment objectives. Also known as OTCBB 
stocks, Bulletin Board stocks are over-the-counter equity securities 
that occupy the far end of the investment risk spectrum and are not 
traded on Nasdaq or listed on an organized exchange. They are 
consequently appropriate only for investors who understand the risks 
involved. Investors should note that: 

?????Lack of automation in the OTCBB market can delay order execution 
?????and reporting. For this reason, our 60-Second Commitment does
?????not apply to Bulletin Board orders. 

?????Partial executions and unfilled orders are common because the 
?????price and number of shares available may change when an order for 
?????OTCBB securities is presented to a market maker. 

?????Wide percentage spreads between bid and ask may trigger a 
?????substantial loss--without a movement in stock quote -- if OCTBB 
?????securities are liquidated soon after purchase. 

?????OTCBB securities trade without customer order representation. 
?????This means that prices for these securities are set only by 
?????market makers. 

Investment quality should also be a major concern if you are 
considering investing in OTCBB securities. Given these securities' 
minimal listing requirements (relative to Nasdaq-listed stocks), wide 
spreads and markets short on reliable information, it should come as 
no surprise to learn that OTCBB stocks have the potential to be 
manipulated with an intention to create artificial demand. 

Please note the following important information on Bulletin Board 
stock trading at Datek Online: 

?????Regular $9.99 commission for online trades up to 5,000 shares 
?????Extended-Hours trading is not available 
?????60-second commitment does not apply 
?????Limit orders only
