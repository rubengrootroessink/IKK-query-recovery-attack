Gerald - the attached represents the documents that WIlliam's is willing to 
sign.  They will not give us a "material change" out.  My preference is to 
sign the attached as it represents a free option to ENA.

Chris, 

Here is the latest and greatest version.? The changes that we made from your 
last version are reflective of the phone conversation between you and Donny 
King the other day.? We had some other changes adding some information 
defining the project and some other minor housekeeping changes.? Let us know 
what you think.
