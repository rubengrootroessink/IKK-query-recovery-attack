Dear Co-workers,

 The summer is rapidly coming to a close for me so I just  wanted to take a 
moment to thank you. I appreciate you taking an hour of your day off to talk 
to the new analysts about your job. You allowed us to gain a more complete 
picture of ENA business dealings. For me, each information session felt like 
a uniquely different piece of the Enron puzzle. I enjoyed learning about your 
multi-faceted worlds. Thank you.

 My last day here will be in about 2 weeks, on August 4th. I will be 
returning to Rice University for my last year and then who knows... you might 
see me back here next year. Regardless, it was a pleasure meeting you and 
please let me know if I can be of any service.
