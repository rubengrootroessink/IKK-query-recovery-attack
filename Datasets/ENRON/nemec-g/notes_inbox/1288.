I have been requested to complete a GISB contract with Infinite Energy for 
physical gas trading.  Please see form of guarantee which they are willing to 
provide.  They have not indicated that any guarantee will be required from 
Bridgeline.  Please let me know if this form of guaranty is acceptable or if 
we should request changes when I submit the GISB.
