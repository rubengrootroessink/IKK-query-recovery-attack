WATCH PUCT AND TNRCC ON THE INTERNET


The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and the Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Open Meetings and Work Sessions are now 
available on the Internet in compact video format. 

TexasAdmin.com offers this service by subscription.? The TexasAdmin.com web 
site provides sample PUCT and TNRCC programs.? Scroll down the Home Page to 
"View a Sample Meeting" and click.? Select a program from the list and 
click.? If you do not have RealPlayer 7 or 8, scroll to the bottom of the 
Home Page and click for the free download.? If you want step-by-step 
instructions for the download, click on, and print out, the button below the 
RealPlayer download button.? If you have any trouble, call us at 512-708-0792 
and we will walk you through the process.? If your browser does not respond 
to TexasAdmin.com, go to http://www.texasadmin.com. 

This service is valuable for two reasons: 
? 1.??? It saves you time; you do not have to attend the meeting; you? watch 
when it is convenient for you, from any location. 

2.??? It creates a visual record of important administrative decisions and 
the reasoning behind them. 
?Meetings are now available with a two-business day delay.? Pending 
installation of our high speed line later this month, the PUCT meetings will 
be live and the TNRCC meetings will be available with a 4-hour delay (and 
eventually live).? Pricing is $200 - $275 per month for a passcode depending 
of the number purchased.? Passcodes are assigned to an individual who can se 
them on any computer.? Charter subscriber discounts are available through the 
end of November. 

Click on "Subscription Information" for more details and then e-mail 
TonyBreard@TexasAdmin.com, or call us to discuss.
