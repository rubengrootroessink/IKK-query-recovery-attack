touche! But these won't work because they are too specific to my dynamic
personality. Whereas, your warnings are general bad behaviors by the
average joe drunkard.

How's it going? How's Barb? Tell her hello for me. Are you lonely over
there at the big E? I hear you're finally getting your fat butt over and
finishing up the job you abandoned. kidding. So we're going to the game
Saturday night? Should be fun. Chao.

I'm thinking they were targeting you guys for some of these...Gerald, I
think numbers four (the official third stage of G), eight (picking fights
and pushing Eric and/or Ryan after drinking) and eleven (I'm so smart
because I work at Enron and you can't teach this you pauper, I need to pump
up my pomp) are for you. Jeff, numbers two (I'll go upstairs right now and
talk to my neighbors and ask them if I'm too loud), five & three (Sinatra
and shadow dancing) and thirteen (every time we go out) are yours. And
Eric, number ten is you. Although the rash would be caused by a mysterious,
moving ramp or stairs and the redness would occur on your ass, not your
forehead!
