I understand that we are meeting tomorrow at 1:00 in Rob's office to discuss 
the proposed amendments to the ECS Agreement.  Attached for your review is a 
red-lined copy of the Agreement with the amendments originally proposed in 
November -- I am also incorporating in this document the amendment we signed 
on Dec. 13 regarding Section 10.11, so that all amendments to the Compression 
Services Agreement  will be captured in one document.
