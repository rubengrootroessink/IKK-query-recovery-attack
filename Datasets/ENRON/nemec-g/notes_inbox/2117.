Gerald,

I had Maria build a multiplier that would ensure our minimum gas requirements 
for each of the months.  We may not need it for the first draft of the 
contract, but I wanted you to take a look at it and let me know what you 
think.

Thanks,

Andrew

Hey Andrew:

Here is the spreadsheet with the heat rate multiplier.  If you want to test 
it in the model, please let me know.  Thanks. Maria
