I've decided that Bruce is ready to be in love and ready to get married and 
if you're cute and smart then look out!  Seriously, I hope it all works out.  
I for one, would not be so quick to move in but what the hell do I know?  

Work is crazy.  I left EGM and am back at Corp working on the CA energy 
crisis.  It's fun, but I'm traveling every week again.  Off to NYC tomorrow.  

Law school applications are in and now I just wait to hear back.  I'm so glad 
to have that off my plate!!  It's incredibly time consuming.  

How are you?  We need to go out and catch up.  This week/weekend is sort of 
crazy but maybe next week.  Are you around?

I know.  It seems as though Mr. Rudy is in love, so damned the consequences!!

How are you doing?  Work treating you okay?  How is the law school 
application going?
