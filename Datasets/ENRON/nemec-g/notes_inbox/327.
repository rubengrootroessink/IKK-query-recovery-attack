I will be in California beginning this Friday through next week . . . so
I won't be at work to check e-mails.
If something changes with the planned conference call you'll have to
send e-mail to home ---   cattlepig@earthlink.net
or leave a message on my home voicemail for me to retrieve.  Otherwise,
I'll just plan on speaking with you all on Saturday morning, August 12th
@ 11:00 a.m.
