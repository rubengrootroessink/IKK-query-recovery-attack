Hi Eric: 

ENA had an agreement with MarkWest that expired January 6, 2001 re Possible 
ENA debt or equity financing in connection with MarkWest's participation in 
certain midstream gas processing plant projects in  East Lost Hills area - 
Kern City California.  

That is the only agreement I have with or pertaining to MarkWest.
