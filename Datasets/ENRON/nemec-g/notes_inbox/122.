These are the only letters I have received thus far and they were forwarded 
without a note.  The ENA contracts would be handled by Connie Sutton's group.

Jackie,
 These are all transport agreements.  As such Gerald Nemec should be the 
person to review the assignment letters.  Did we get anything whereby Entex 
Gas Marketing inc assigned its master agreements spot and firm with Enron 
North America Corp. to the new Entex entity?
