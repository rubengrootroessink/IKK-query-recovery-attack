Attached is a revised petition which includes the section of ECS'
discussions with WFEC.  Please review.  I sending out this draft for the
sake of saving time without review by my clients and am asking them to
review as well.  I assume the next step is for Jeff to revise the
conclusion with the bullets points and circulate a final draft for
everyone's review.  Let me know if this is not the case.  Thanks for your
help.
