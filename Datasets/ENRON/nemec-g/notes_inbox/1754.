Subject: Gilmer Rental Tower

Yesterday, March 27 , 2001 , Aaron Ortiz visited Gilmer Tower to perform 
required test and checks on the VHF Radio System at said tower. The equipment 
tested good , but the following discrepancies were noted about the rental 
tower site at Gilmer.

1. There was no FAA registration number posted on the tower.
2. Tower lights were found to be non functional, as well as either side 
lights or the beacon on top the tower. Also observed red side light lenses 
not covering the  fixtures, but were hanging by their safety chain. Circuit 
breakers were checked, none appeared to be inactive and apparently the tower 
light controller has failed or the bulbs are burned out.
3. There was no evidence of any equipment at the tower which would allow 
remote monitoring of the tower lights.

In view of these discrepancies I immediately contacted Ron Green and James 
McKay and the decision was made to remove HPL radio equipment,  license, and 
log book from the location. A tower crew is scheduled to remove the coax & 
antenna next week. 

Recommendations are:

1. Cancel the license immediately.
2. Send a certified register letter to the tower owner stating reasons for 
removing equipment.































7 antenna next week
