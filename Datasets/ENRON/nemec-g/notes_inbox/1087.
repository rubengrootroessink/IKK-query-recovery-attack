Sounds like you had a fun trip. Good you deserve it........Cindy got your
name, although i  shouldn't be spoiling the surprize. Ha!!! So far Will and
Sharon are coming in on the 22nd and leaving Christmas morn. Got an e-mail
from Cindy saturday and they plan on being here around that date too. It
will depend on Lindsey's job. She is working at the Gap at the Mall in
Slidell. She has a car now.....Wayne is going to come in too, but he hasn't
figured out when since he took off for Thanksgiving. He may just come in for
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Himm and Paul were here for four days they
went hunting with James to the deer lease after Thanksgiving. They didn't
get anything though.
        Today is Janice's 40th BIRTHDAY.......Barry is planning a surprize
Birthday Party tonight. I'm keeping the kids while Patty picks Janice up and
they have a date to do their Nails. Patty is taking her for her Birthday
present.......Then Barry is picking up the kids and we are all suppose to
meet down by the mailboxes on their block and surprize her.......So don't
spill the beans HA! HA! That makes me feel old.......Boy, Well all for now.
Dad and I sen our love.........MOM

Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and
sound from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming.

So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is
everyone coming in for the holiday?  I am planning on coming down the 23rd.
