Gerald, I got the Purchase Contract to Don Schultz.  He wanted me to let
you know that he has a lot going on tomorrow but will make every effort
to get you feedback tomorrow.

Terry,  Attached is a typical form that was executed.   Specifically
Section 3.3 under which we will be curtail are takes from the Producers
and
any requirements to take pro rata from producers in Wyoming.  Thanks.
Any
possibility of getting feedback by tommorrow.  Thanks.
