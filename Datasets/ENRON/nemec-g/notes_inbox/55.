		 Subject: Data Responses


We have been served with the data responses of Northern Border to requests by 
PAGUS, NGPL, Staff, and others.  Some of this information would be useful to 
John in preparing for his testimony at the hearing, and also for the purpose 
of crafting the cross examination of opposing witnesses.  These data 
responses are available in our office for you to peruse it at your leisure.

In terms of scheduling, the next important date is June 14, which is when 
Northern Border submits rebuttal testimony, and when Staff, PAGUS, and NGPL 
file rebuttal in response to John's answering testimony.  Discovery on that 
testimony is due June 23.  Your help in formulating discovery will be needed.

The hearing is presently scheduled for July 18 (absent settlement).  
Obviously we will need to get together to prepare cross of the opposing 
witnesses and to prep John for his testimony.

In terms of progress on settlement, you should be aware that while there have 
been some private settlement talks among certain parties, there is no 
presently scheduled settlement conference.  Nevertheless, we expect some or 
all of the parties will be working to try to achieve some form of settlement 
until the hearing starts.  However, whether a full or partial settlement of 
the rate case issues will occur before the hearing is too speculative to 
predict at this time.
