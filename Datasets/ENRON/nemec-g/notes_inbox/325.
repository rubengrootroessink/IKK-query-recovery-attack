I don't know if anyone has the pressure data your looking for, but Ken would 
be the man to track it down.
We took samples of our production, upstream of the Wild Horse San Arroyo 
plant, but do not yet have the analysis back. Should have tomorrow.
Re the sample taken downstream of Wild Horse S.A. plant, I was told that it 
met dew point spec, but we have been unable to obtain the actual written test 
results. It appears that Wild Horse is withholding that information.

Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure 
is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the 
contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data?  
Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.  

Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks 
for your help.
