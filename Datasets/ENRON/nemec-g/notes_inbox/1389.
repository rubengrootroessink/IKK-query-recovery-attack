Gerald,
We have an executed Corporate Guarantee from Constellation for the work to be 
done at the Interconnect.  We estimate the cost to install at $100K.  The 
guarantee is for $300K.  Constellation will be responsible for the costs even 
if the Interconnect is assigned, as is permitted by the Interconnect 
Agreement, to Pinnacle (PNG Utility).

Greg
