Matt,

I got a few ideas....................(1) My mom works with Mrs. Stater whose 
daughter is an international stewardess with United, Kristin Stater, she 
maybe able to get in contact with her or locate her quicker, (Sandoms e-mail 
address is  gillassa@fairfield.k12.ia.us)..........................OR
(2) Call the LA county courts and get the judges' office number.  Do know 
what court he presides in, i.e. Family Court, Criminal, Civil, etc.

I've never heard of Jeff's company before, but it sounds like it is a fairly 
small operation.

I can't believe that I'm having this much difficulty contacting my
European friends.

My London friend's father is a judge for Los Angeles County so his
phone/address is unlisted and I don't know anyone that would know his
information.  So, I've sent a letter to United Airlines (she works for
them) in Chicago asking them to forward the letter on to their London
base to Linda.  We'll see if they do that for me.

And my Russian friend's parents have moved away from Downey (Calif) and
I don't know where they are [plus their last name is Castro so there are
hundreds of them in California].  So, I've sent a letter to the church
in Downey that Ron is "evangelizing" for asking them to forward my
letter to Russia.  I have an e-mail and mail address for him, but
neither seems to work even though I correspond with him a couple times
each year.  I don't know if the church in Russia has been overthrown by
the locals or what.

I'll keep you posted.

You and your lovely bride are getting a new roommate this summer I hear.
Sounds like a pretty good opportunity for Jeff in Austin.  Have you
heard of that company before around there?
