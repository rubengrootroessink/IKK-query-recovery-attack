Gerald,
As per our discussions: I believe that I did not keep a copy of the mid-year 
performance review that I sent to you inter-office for Eric Gillaspie.  Since 
the report has been misplaced, to expedite your review, I have outlined my 
comments on Eric's performance below ( I have used the ENA Commercial form, 
hope it fits your needs):

Skills/Behaviors
Innovation/Entrepreneurship -  Rating: Strong
Eric has been very keen on learning the various facets of Interconnect 
Agreements. He has come up the learning curve quickly and he has been very 
insightful and helpful in crafting a document that includes a well founded 
commercial document.  
Communication/Setting Direction - Rating: Strong
Eric is very clear and concise in his work.  He seems very aware of both the 
commercial requirements and the preferred form of Interconnect Agreement 
terms and conditions of the Legal department.  He does a strong job of 
directing his work to maximize the goals of both units.

Teamwork/Interpersonal - Strong
Very easily joins in on a team effort - Gateway Interconnect Agreement for 
example - and makes a positive contribution.  My experience with Eric is that 
he has a strong personal presence that he uses to achieve his objectives in 
an easy yet successful manner.

Leadership/Values - Excellent
Eric always seems to have an excellent knowledge of the legal and commercial 
requirements of the interconnect agreement and he readily shares this 
knowledge to win his position.  His strong skill set lends a leadership 
quality to his work that is very strong.  Regarding Enron values, Eric is a 
great example of our Vision and Values Program.

Business Instincts - Strong
As Eric has been learning the strategy that the Generation Marketing Group 
is  following with regard to interconnecting as many as possible with a 
minimum of expense and risk exposure, he has been making more and more 
commercially and legally sound recommendations

Analytical/Technical - Satisfactory
Eric has showed a satisfactory set of legal skills to enable him to construct 
the agreements which we have worked on over the period.  I believe that as he 
spends more time at Enron and comes up on the experience curve he will become 
even more skilled and technically strong performer.

Overall Rating - Strong

Qualitative Comments
Interaction Experience: Eric is very approachable and is always willing to 
tackle a new assignment.  He is easy going yet is firm in his positions.  He 
seems to want to "study" a problem sometimes as opposed to making a "snap" 
decision.  When he does take this time the results are usually very 
satisfactory.  He produces a quality product that will get even better as he 
gets more Enron time under his belt.  He is timely with his work and has been 
very helpful in creating numerous interconnect agreements for Gateway, Rio 
Nogales, Alstom and Chambers Energy among others.

Major Strengths: Is able to produce needed work in a professional, accurate, 
and timely manner.  Appears to have a good grasp on the legal concepts I have 
needed assistance on to date.

Continued Development: I think that traditional Enron in house courses as 
well as outside conferences and workshops that cover areas pertinent to Enron 
projects would help in Eric's overall understanding of our commercial 
businesses.


I hope that this is helpful.  Please let me know if you have any questions
