 I have just spoken with Ms. Joyce G. Labus, project manager for City Public 
Services of San Antonio. Ms. Labus has informed me that CPS will change it's 
delivery point from the current point six (6) feet +/- outside of our 
existing fifty (50) foot right of way on the Thompsonville to Prarie Lea 30" 
Pipeline to a point at or on the west or northwest easement line of said HPL 
30" pipeline. This enables HPL to install the necessary appurtances within 
HPL's existing 50 foot wide right of way without acquiring additional 
easement rights.
