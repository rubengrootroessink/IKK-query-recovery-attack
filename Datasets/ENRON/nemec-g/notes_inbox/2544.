I think that these are current, but you might want to check with Steve Van 
Hooser to verify that there have been no changes.

George,

As requested, attached are clean and black-lined versions of the latest draft 
of Ground Lease.  The black-lined is marked to show changes made to the 
10/27/00 draft.  Also, although this draft does not contain the change, note 
that in the definition for CPI, the blank will be filled in with "Atlanta, 
Georgia".
