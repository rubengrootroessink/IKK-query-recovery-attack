Gerald,
As per my phone message.  FPL would like us to return to the original Article 
12 regarding governing law, except that they would accept Texas as opposed to 
Florida.  They apparently do not like our arbitration provisions.

Thanks,
Greg ext. 31923

Bill,
I have attached a red lined mark up of the Confidentiality Agreement which 
you forwarded.  If needs be, we can get our counselors together directly to 
review boiler plate issues.

Greg
