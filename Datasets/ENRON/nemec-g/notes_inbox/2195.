A few things:

1.  Questar Pipeline is not at the tailgate of Opal.
2.  With respect to the price, do you mean the price will be set based on
the last day settlement of each individual month on the contract, or the
average of all the settlements.  We would prefer to price it monthly based
on the last day settlement, I think that's what you mean, I just wanted to
verify.  If that's not what you meant, let me know.
3.  I just want to make sure that this is a firm purchase that could be
curtailed only due to force majeure.

I will hopefully be able to get back to you today on the deal, we are
checking credit to make sure we don't have a problem doing this much gas
with you guys, I don't think we'll have a problem but I'll let you know.  

Because of the size and term of this deal, we have to get board approval,
and that is happening next Wednesday.  Would you be able to do the deal
today subject to board approval?  I don't foresee any problems with the
board, but we do need them to sign off on it.  

Let me know what you think!

Brian

Brian this is a draft version of what the Transaction Agreements would
like.  Let me know if the form looks right to you.  Obviously we will
adjust to what the actual deal is.

Thanks
