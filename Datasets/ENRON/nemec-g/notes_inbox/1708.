HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net  REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Why, in the information age, do so many continue to pay so much to West 
and Lexis? There is an excellent answer to this question. Enhancements.

--YOU OWN THE LAW

     West and Lexis do not own the law. You do. Your tax dollars already paid 
for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities; data that West 
and Lexis snags and enhances. Thereafter, your organization pays and pays for 
a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful.

--THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS

     In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such 
as tedious training seminars, repeated calls to tech support, and an 
overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference 
tasks, there has to be a better, faster, easier, less expensive answer.
     Are all of these enhancements really worth 10 - 20 times the price of a 
subscription to TheLaw.net, particularly when West and Lexis are available on 
the web 24/7 whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card? 
How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, the 13 Federal Circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and the 
intermediate level appellate courts? Call you local rep and ask?

--THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT: SEARCHABLE CASE LAW

     In our opinion, the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle 
are their searchable case law databases. But we have one, too; the third 
largest on earth next to theirs. With an annual subscription to TheLaw.net 
Professional Convenience Edition you can search 24 hours a day for an entire 
year, across more than 175 Federal and state appellate jurisdictions for just 
$345 if you sign up by April 30, 2001. And we don't insult your intelligence 
by slicing things up. Everybody gets everything we have on an unlimited use 
basis. Is that a model you've been waiting for, or what?
     We even place browsable and searchable Federal and state statutes, 
forms, rule, regs, courts, executive agency databases, legislative tracking 
tools, news and reference desk resources, right where you want them; a mouse 
click or two away on your desktop.

--CONSIDER OUR REFERENCES

     Why take our word for it? Consider our references and reviews, some of 
which we've published to our web site. http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

--THE THREE RULES OF OUR SUCCESS

      At TheLaw.net Corporation we have three simple rules:

----RULE ONE: Everyone gets everything we have.
----RULE TWO: Similarly situated subscribers always pay the same price.
----RULE THREE: Current prices are always out in the open on our web site:
--------$395 annually for you
--------$575 for you and a partner
--------$1195 for your five user workgroup
--------Enterprise Licenses are also available.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

     Imagine. No surprises. No meters. No printing, downloading or 
pay-per-view fees. In short, none of the gamesmanship you have come to expect 
from the big two compusearchers.

--CONSIDER OUR VISION: A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW FLAT-RATE

     TheLaw.net, privately held and successful from Day One, represents the 
next logical step; a big improvement over slogging through two billion web 
pages and otherwise watching legal research costs spiral out of control at a 
time when with normal free market principles at work, such costs would be 
plummeting.
     In some instances, subscribers have found they no longer need to deal 
with West or Lexis. In most instances they have found that the list of 
expensive resources that they need to buy is much shorter. And we always 
remind them that everything West and Lexis has is available pay-per-view, a 
la carte, via the Internet. All you need is authorization from your client 
and a credit card.

--SAVE $50 ON THELAW.NET PROFESSIONAL CONVENIENCE EDITION

     Subscribing to TheLaw.net is not a decision you need to overthink. An 
individual annual subscription to TheLaw.net Convenience Edition is on sale 
right now for just $345. It includes an unconditional 30-day money back 
guarantee and you can install at work, at home and on your laptop.
     Stick your big toe in the water and see how good it feels. We already 
know that 95% of our subscribers stay with us past the 30-day opt out period 
and that 75% will begin adding TheLaw.net to additional desktops within 90 
days.
     A lot has changed since you went to law school. One of the biggest 
changes is that the days of two legal research behemoths calling all of the 
shots and making all of the rules are over. The time is now to lose the 
chains by subscribing to TheLaw.net Professional today. At your option, we 
can build your package and deliver it today via our web site or we can ship 
CDs via U.S. Priority Mail or FedEx. We thank you for your time and we hope 
to hear from you soon.
