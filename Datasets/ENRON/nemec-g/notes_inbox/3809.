As you know, Enron will be implementing the new SAP system effective July 1, 
which will impact a number of our activities at ENA.  Please watch for 
additional information via interoffice mail and e-mail, as well as 
informational events in the lobby during the month of June.

The first change you will notice is the receipt of your personal SAP 
Personnel Number.  This number will replace our current use of your Social 
Security Number.  With identity theft on the rise, it is imperative that we 
do all that we can to ensure your privacy with respect to your Social 
Security Number.  This new SAP Personnel Number will be your ticket to the 
various SAP functions.

One of the important functions within the new SAP system is HR On-line.  
Within this area, you will have access to all personal information, including 
paycheck information, benefit elections, vacation balances and all personal 
data, like home address, phone numbers and emergency contact information.  
You will have the ability to view all of this information and the 
responsibility to revise it when necessary.

With the launch of this new program, all current department numbers (or RCs) 
will be changed to six digit Cost Center numbers.  These new Cost Center 
numbers will be used for all financial activities.  Training regarding the 
new coding processes has been targeted to all department assistants and is 
available on Wednesday, May 31.  The sessions last one hour.   To register, 
please contact Michelle Vitrella at ext. 3-9767.

Additional information regarding training will be available during the next 
few weeks.  Be on the lookout for it.  Lastly, if you need more information 
today, please access the SAP web site at sap.enron.com.  Thank you for your 
assistance during this transition.
