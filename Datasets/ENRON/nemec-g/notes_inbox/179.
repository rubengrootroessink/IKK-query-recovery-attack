Further to earlier e-mail, attached is the revised First Amendment Agreement 
with a marked additional change.  The change is to Section 3 of Flow of Funds 
memo; original wire amounts will remain with extra $30,488 originally wired 
by ECHO to ECS accounted for by adding a new (d) stating that this amount 
will be paid by ECS to ENA to cover ENA's increased obligation under amended 
2(d) of Flow of Funds memo to pay HPL $195,178.  Regards, NJD

Attached please find a revised First Amendments Agreement.  The only change 
since yesterday's draft was to Exhibit A to include ECHO's notice address 
before August 1, 2000 and on and after August  1, 2000. 

 Are we now ready to begin execution?  

Regards, NJD
