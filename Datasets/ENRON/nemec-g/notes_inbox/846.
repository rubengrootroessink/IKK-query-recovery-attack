One of the trading desks is ready to support a new product on EOL for 
transportation capacity.  This should be a very simple product.  At this 
point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all.  The 
product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at 
all on the front screen.  We will explain the product in detail in the 
Product Description.  The attachment below shows an example of how the fields 
would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description.  I 
have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three 
different products like this.  

Gerald, Steve--
I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one 
of you to "fix it up".  We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance 
to review it.  Just call me once you decide who should handle this--Jeff 
Hodge suggested that I start with you two.

Dave--
What does your schedule look like the rest of the week?  I'd like to get 
together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this.  Since I don't 
think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could 
get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work.   I also 
need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, 
etc.  Please let me know the process so we can get moving.  

Thanks for your assistance.
