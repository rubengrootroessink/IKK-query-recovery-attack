Ran this by Mike Grigsby. His last recollection is that we never agreed to 
include the San Juan basin for the purpose of this valuation.  Can you please 
advise.?

If San Juan is included, non-bondad is the correct reference.

The adjustment for the potential reallocation is okay.

I am at x31688.

thanks

Stephanie
