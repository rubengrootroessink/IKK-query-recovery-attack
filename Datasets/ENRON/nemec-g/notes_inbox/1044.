This is something that we are looking at as either a Crescendo acquisition or 
an ENA acquisition.  It is being evaluated as an option to rectifying our 
situation with Wildhorse and/or as a less expensive option to building the 
necessary gathering infrastructure to gather the San Arroyo High Nitrogen gas 
as well as other potential High Nitrogen acquisition targets.  The idea being 
that owning the entire complex might make for an attractive package that 
could be flipped once all the pieces are in place and at a more developed 
stage.

I think it is important for everyone to realize that if we do not buy this 
gathering system, that Tom Brown is not going to do anything to address our 
current situation.  They are simply going to sell it to someone else and that 
will take a significant amount of time.  Once that is completed we would then 
begin this entire process over with a new entity.  This would lead to 
significant delays in the overall plant and production development time 
table.  There is a potential deal that might be struck with Northern Border, 
but we need to go down this path to see how we would want to do that.

Let me know if you would like to discuss further.

I spoke with Bob Mustard of Tom Brown today and we are going to get access to 
the Wildhorse information on Wed. Nov. 29 at 1:00 MST in the Kinder Morgan 
offices.  We will have until Christmas to agree on a value for the assets we 
have an interest in acquiring.  Tom Brown plans to have a Data Room open Jan. 
3-12 to sell all of their Pieceance and Uintah gathering assets.  If we have 
agreed on a value for this system by Christmas then they will not include 
these assets in that Data Room.  Let's discuss the particulars in the Tues 
morning meeting tommorow.

Mark
