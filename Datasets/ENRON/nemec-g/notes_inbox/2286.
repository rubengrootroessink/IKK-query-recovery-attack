Hey everyone.. something fun to do for the kids.
This is from my home town so it'd be cool if you help
out!   Marsha

Hello! We are in the 2nd grade at McComb Elementary
School in Caro, Michigan. We are located in Tuscola
County, We have decided, after seeing this done at
another school, to map an e-mail project. We are
curious to see where in the world our e-mail will
travel via the Internet, between the period of
February 1, 2001, May 1, 2001, (only 3 months).
This is not a pen pal project, so we will not write
you back (unless you request it).We would like your
help. If you receive this message, we ask that you:

1) e-mail back at: kfestian@caro.k12.mi.us
> > > and tell us your
city/state/location so we can plot it on our map

2) Send this letter on to everyone you know so that
they can send it on to everyone they know (and so on)
to help us reach even more people.

We're tracking the number of responses we receive by
making a graph in our math classes using the numbers
received by state.
With your help, we can make this a very fun and
exciting learning experience. PLEASE help us.

Thank you for any help you can give.

Your friends,

Ben H. McComb Elementary School
Mrs. Festian's 2nd Grade
303 N. Hooper Street
Caro, MI 48723

Thanks to the students and teachers of Savannah Grove
Elementary School in Effingham, SC for sharing this
awesome activity.
