Steve and Mark - here it is.  Trailblazer will not allow any changes to this 
document.

Steve - please print out two and initial.  I'll walk up and get them.  Our 
bid and P.A. must be fax'd by 5:00 p.m. today.  The open season bid form and 
the P.A. will not be sent to Trailblazer without an Executed Transaction 
Agreement with Huber (Shelia Tweed is working on this with Mark).
