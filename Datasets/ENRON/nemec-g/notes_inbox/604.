   Mark - update on the agreements.  They are still on Bobby's desk waiting 
his 
signature.  I went to check on them and his sec said he is not even scheduled 
in the office until the 21st.  They said he may be in on Saturday the 16th - 
if so, he will sign them then.  Please forward this update to whom ever needs 
it in your shop.
   Sorry for the delay, he hasn't been in the office much at all.  FYI,  Lee H
