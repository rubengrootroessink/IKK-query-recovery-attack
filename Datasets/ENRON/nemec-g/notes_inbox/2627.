Gerald,
I believe that I forwarded this to you previously.  I need you to review this 
and send it over to Glen Fox
and Jeff Sherrick for execution.  This formalizes the hand-off of the Chile 
project to ECS.  

Thanks
mk

Mark:

Attached is a redline version of your draft letter transferring the 
opportunity from EGEP to ENA/ESA after review by EGEP's legal dept.  If you 
would finalize the letter and send us an executable copy, it should be ready 
for Jeff Sherrick's signature.  Best regards - Glenn
