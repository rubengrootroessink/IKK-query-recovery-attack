Shawna,

I was informed incorrectly that you would be handling these files.  They have 
been forwarded to Gerald Nemec. 

I stopped by your office immediately after you e-mailed me regarding this 
matter.  You were not in.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl concerning this matter.   He 
located the files for me that were routed to you for review.  They are now in 
my possession and will be forwarded to Gerald Nemec.

Thanks.
