Sorry for the late notice, but plans were just finalized last night over much 
social lubrication at a local meeting establishment.  So here's the scoop.  
The University has some issues with us having a large party unregulated by 
them, so we are not having a party.  We are not having a party tomorrow 
starting at noon beside the Rubgy field in the stadium parking lot (same 
place as last year).     

We are going undercover without a tent.  This is the Tailgate Unplugged.  No 
tents, no big Bud trucks, no big blow up penguins, no 500 lbs of fajitas, and 
no 80 kegs (notice there was also no desperate plea for sponsorship money).  
The original 6 ot 7 of us are just going to hang out in the parking lot with 
1 can of beer each.  Of course, being the liver impaired individuals that we 
are, the single beer can we each have should have will probably hold about, 
ohhh, say...16 gallons.

Come if you can, rain or shine, and not party with us.
