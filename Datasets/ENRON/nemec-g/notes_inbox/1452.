First Leg Of Radiohead Dates Begin Mid-June In Texas 
May 2, 4 a.m. ET, SonicNet

After playing only two small-scale U.S. shows in support of their last album, 
Kid A, Radiohead will meet the masses next month on their first full-fledged 
North American tour in three years. 
Following the June 5 release of Amnesiac, the formerly reclusive experimental 
rockers will begin a tour of outdoor amphitheaters on June 18 in Spring, 
Texas, just north of Houston. 
From there, the first leg of the U.K. band's tour will move through the West, 
ending June 30 in Santa Barbara, California. More dates are expected to 
follow. 
Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood has described Amnesiac as falling somewhere 
between the band's original, guitar-driven sound and the icy electronics of 
the chart-topping Kid A.

"It's about 50-50," Greenwood said earlier this year. "It's got more 
traditional Radiohead-type songs together with more experimental, 
nonlyrical-based instrumental-type stuff as well, and it works as a record in 
its entirety, which is what we care about." 
Radiohead tour dates, according to Capitol Records: 
6/18 - Spring, TX @ C.W. Mitchell Pavilion 
6/20 - Morrison, CO @ Red Rocks Amphitheatre 
6/23 - George, WA @ The Gorge 
6/24 - Vancouver, BC @ Thunderbird Stadium 
6/27 - Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre 
6/29 - Santa Barbara, CA @ Santa Barbara Bowl 
6/30 - Santa Barbara, CA @ Santa Barbara Bowl
