Revised estimate for the retainage is approximately $434,022.35.

Also, I have included a copy of what I sent to Greg Schlender earlier for 
Karry.  The retainage amount above is included in the accrual for services

Greg,

The estimated liability for retainage is approximately $216,000.  I hope this 
helps!
