Julia --

Mark Haedicke told me that Enron hires summer interns for the Legal 
department and suggested that I pass a resume on to you for consideration.  
The attached resume is for Chris Knudsen, who is a cousin by marriage and is 
interested in Enron as a potential career after law school.

Give me a call at ext. 3-9053, if you need anything else.  Thank you for your 
consideration of his resume.

Eric
