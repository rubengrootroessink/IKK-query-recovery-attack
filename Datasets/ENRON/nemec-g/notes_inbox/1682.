Shane,
 I am having a meeting with Barbara Gray this afternoon to discuss ENA 
Upstream in general and your recent TPA request as it relates to ENA Upstream 
business--after that, I 'll give you a call about how we are going to proceed 
with this--Kim Bennick will be assisting me on all TPA issues going forward 
and will be working on getting the Upstream TPAS in place once we map out our 
plan. 

Sandi
