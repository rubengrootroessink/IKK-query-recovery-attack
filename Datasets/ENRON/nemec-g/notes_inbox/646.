Dear Fellow Diver:

WOW!  This year is flying by!  I can't believe it is September already.  Only 
a few more months before we get wet and wild in Grand Cayman at Total 
Submersion (http://www.padi.com/pds/news/total_immersion/ ). Just last week I 
was informed that almost one hundred people have signed up.  Remember, 
mention the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter to me during the event and I'll buy 
you a drink.  There are going to be scavenger hunts, beach parties, 
barbecues, Scuba Tune Ups and much more.

Have you seen the latest issue of Sport Diver at http://www.sportdiver.com/ ? 
It's great!  It has a little of everything for every diver.  It covers great 
local diving in places like Hoodsport, Washington, Cabrillo, California, and 
Beaufort, North Carolina.  The magazine also does a great job of promoting 
more exotic diving as well.  Future issues will take you to Patagonia, 
Russia, and Malaysia.  Let the publisher and editor know what you want to see 
and be sure to tell them how great your local diving is.

For those unfortunate few of you not joining me during Total Submersion, 
American Airlines and PADI Travel Network still have a great travel offer for 
you! Save up to 35% on flights and hotels during American's Caribbean Fall 
Sale -- http://www.padi.com/ptn/specials.stm (discount valid September 4 
through December 20, 2000, when you ticket by September 22). Sorry for the 
late notice, American springs these on us from time to time and rather than 
bother you with a ton of emails I saved this one for this newsletter.

Bill, in Las Vegas, Nevada sent me a note telling me how he combined a trade 
show business trip with a day at Lake Mead.  You know, about 32 million 
people a year visit Las Vegas, Nevada for business and pleasure.  Lake Mead 
is only 45 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip.  There are some great PADI 
dive centers in Las Vegas who would love to show you a good time.  Think 
about it, and check out the PADI Dive and Resort Directory at 
http://www.padi.com/search/dcnr.asp to locate a PADI Dive Center in the area.

OK, now let's see who has been paying attention.  On Page 86 of the 
September/October issue of Sport Diver Magazine, the official publication of 
the PADI Diving Society, how many people in the advertisement for Total 
Submersion are wearing PADI hats?  E-mail me the correct answer with your 
name, address, and phone number and you I will draw one person who will 
receive a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, compliments of PADI.  Contest open to US 
Residents only, please. Details on the trip will be announced, along with the 
winner's name, in the November Fellow Diver Newsletter.

PADI was recently contacted by Dr. David Colvard for assistance with a 
research study he is conducting in reference to diver safety. We'd like to 
ask your help by participating in the survey. It's simple, no big words, 
quick, and it's on line. Go to the survey at 
http://www.scubadiving.com/feature/safetysurvey/ .

Have you been to ZuluSports.com at http://www.zulusports.com/ yet?  
ZuluSports is the world's only comprehensive online resource for outdoor and 
adventure sports enthusiasts. It has up-to-the-minute information on 15 
sports (including Scuba) and provides coverage for over 350 destinations 
around the world. Check it out. When not underwater, PADI divers can often be 
found mountain biking, kayaking or enjoying their favorite land or air based 
adventure sport, although you won't catch me jumping out of any airplanes 
anytime soon! And before you write me about that comment, it's not a put down 
of another sport, it's just a fact!

I've been really impressed with the number of e-mails I got from you telling 
me how many of you have taken the advanced course or at least a few 
specialties headed in that direction.  We've just released the new CD-ROM 
version of The Adventures in Diving Program 
(http://www.padi.com/products/catalog/aow.stm ), so if you're been thinking 
about getting becoming an Adventure Diver or Advanced Open Water Diver, 
there's never been a better time. The flexibility of the program, which 
supports home study, makes it easy for you to progress at your pace while 
getting the most out of your experience.  Sign up at your local PADI dive 
center and resort.

Saturday, September 16th is International Beach Clean-up Day 
(http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/environmental/090800_splash/ 
). The Project AWARE Foundation is helping coordinate thousands of divers and 
non-divers clean up beaches all over the world.  What are you doing on the 
16th of September?  Check with your local PADI dive center to see how you and 
your family can join in the fun for a good cause.  But what about me, you 
ask?  I'm doing my fair share.  On September 23, I'll be participating in a 
beach clean-up dive in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, with the Minister of 
Tourism.  I'll tell you all about it next Fellow Diver Newsletter.

Until next month,

Brian Cronin
Senior Vice President,
Business Development and International Business
