I have set up a tentative conference call with the city of Palo Alto to meet 
regarding our Management Services Agreement and their comments.  They intend 
to have both their City Attorney and outside council at this meeting.  If 
this conflicts with your schedule, please let me know.  As soon as Palo Alto 
confirms this time, I will let you know.

Thanks,

Kim
