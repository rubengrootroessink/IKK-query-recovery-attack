We don't have a system workaround that allows a customer to transact  on a 
Product that's not covered by a Master Agreement and NOT choose a GTC.

So, having to choose a GCT for a transaction that would not be Confirmed is a 
Mark Taylor issue.

Carlos, do you know Mark's position on this? If not, please follow-up with 
Mark.

The product description specifically designates a GTC -if we are not 
confirming the transactions should we make this reference?  Other than that, 
it seems ok.  For those that have not been involved in the discussions, this 
type of transaction will not bridge automatically from EOL to Sitara.  It 
will have to be monitored and entered manually.  Since this will be a 
capacity release deal, the pipeline contract number that we a releasing will 
be a crucial piece of information when entering the transport capacity deal.
