Dwight:

Here are the contracts as submitted yesterday with the pricing change to the
Level 3 Capacity in ash handling as mentioned earlier today.  I have
forwarded a copy of the contracts to your attorney for his review as well as
a set to ReUse's attorney.  I will contact you this afternoon to make sure
you received the contracts, have any questions and see what the next steps
involve.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Kris Johnson
