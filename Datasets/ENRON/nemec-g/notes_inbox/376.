As a matter of fact, we received a fax copy of the gty in favor of Resources 
Corp.  Now  all of the credit issues are taken care of and we can proceed 
with the legal assignment issues.  Also, we have already communicated to the 
EOL team to have their status changed to reflect the assignment/new entity.

Give me a call if I could be of any further help.

Veronica,

I believe I spoke with you a few weeks ago about a credit check for the 
assignment of a gas transportation contract from Entex Gas Marketing Company 
to Entex Gas Resources Corp.  Could I have an update on the situation?

Thanks,

Mr. Reves,

I have not received a response in regards to the assignment of the Entex 
contracts (as discussed below) from a credit standpoint.  We would like to 
make the assignment as soon as possible so long as credit does not have an 
issue with the new Entex entity.  

Thanks,

Mr. Reeves,

Entex Gas Marketing intends to assign certain interruptible gas 
transportation agreements to a new company of theirs which is:

 Entex Gas Resources Corp.  (it is a TX Corp.)
 P.O. Box 200905
 Houston, TX 77216

Would you please run a credit check on this new entity.

Thanks,
