Gerald,

We have taken a first pass look through all the old San Arroyo files we
received from Enogex.  There seems to be very little information on the gas
gathering agreement.  There is a file on the gas gathering agreement, but it
is very incomplete and does not go back past Enogex's ownership.

I will fax you a letter from Lone Mountain to KN Energy dated 1998
concerning pressures on the Gathering system in the area, including some of
our non-op wells.  There is some old well by well data from 1994 that shows
well flowing tubing pressures at San Arroyo in the 80-90 psig range.
Gathering system pressures would need to be below those.  Some of the data
is before the execution of the gathering contract 1994 amendment. I can copy
those and send them to you if you so desire.

Ken Krisa

Ken,  Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure
data on
Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the
Gathering
Agreement?  I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any such data.
Thanks.
