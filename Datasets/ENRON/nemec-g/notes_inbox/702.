Dear U2 Fan,


As previously promised,  U2.com visitors can listen to clips from two more
songs from the new album All That You Can't Leave Behind.

Kite and Stuck In A Moment are the two tracks we're revealing on Friday 22nd
- at 11.30am and 7.30pm. You'll also find Edge discussing material from the
bands first new album in three years.

We'll be hosting new tracks from the album every week at U2.com - as well as
bringing you the latest news in the countdown to worldwide release of
Beautiful Day.

You can view the Jonas Akerlund directed video for the new single right now
- and there will be more exclusive U2 video in the next week.

It's starting to get exciting......we'll keep you posted !


Best wishes
