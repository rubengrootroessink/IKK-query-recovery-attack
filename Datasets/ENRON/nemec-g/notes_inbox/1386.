Got me.  Don't get old Gerald, the old rumor about the first thing to go is 
false.

I''ll visit with the Avista-Steag people.  I had told them early in the 
negotiations that I would request a Corporate guarantee.  And now is the time.

Thanks for the heads up.  I too want assurance about payment.
