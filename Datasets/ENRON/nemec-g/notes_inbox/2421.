Hi Kristi,

Hope 2001 is treating you well so far.  We might be interested in the
Flower Garden trip.  What is the price for these trips?

Hi guys,

HAPPY 2001!   We're off to a big start   - we're now on line! Check  us
out at www.scubadoobydoo.com.

As a "heads" up, we have two trips scheduled to the Flower  Gardens trips
in Marchfor the Hammerhead shark  migration! We still have spots
available ? hint, hint. We'll also  have more trips scheduled as soon as
we get back from DEMA at the end of this  month. (We're going through
Cozumel  withdrawal!)

I'll be offering Advanced training, Nitrox, Photography,  Fish ID and other
specialties in conjunction with the Flower Gardens trips. Class dates are
posted on our website.

I'm also offering a new class for 2001 -- Scuba Sign  Language Specialty.
The first class  starts in March.

Best wishes and lots of fishes,

Kristi and Greg Foster
