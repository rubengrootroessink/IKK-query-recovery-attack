I am sending you the Capacity Allocation Agreement Summary.  For a summary, 
it is still four pages, but let me know if this is the sort of thing you were 
looking for.  I tried to shorten certain things, but I inserted some of the 
definitions for clarification of what certain terms in the contract meant.  I 
have finished the "Operating Agreement" also, but I have to look over it 
before I send it.

I will be by to find out what changes you want me to make either this 
afternoon or on Tuesday if that is better for you.
