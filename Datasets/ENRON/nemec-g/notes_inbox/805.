My furniture has been abused and is frightened.  I am going to liberate it 
from the fear of a topless G$ sleeping on it with a Whataburger set 
precariously upon his chest.  Hell, that would scare the heck out of any 
one/thing.

I advise you not to use Hendon as your counselor.

How dare you take such a tone with my counsellor.  You're just bitter that 
you have squandered all rights to your furniture.  Face it, your furniture 
likes me better anyway now.

Hendon,

I don't know what to say.  You sounded so official with that email.  How long 
did it take you to write it?

I'd like to make an announcement.  Hendon has become funny in my absence.  
Funny ha-ha.

I hope you got a good deal on my wine table.

I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever
floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in
the confines of your own mind  : )

Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had
squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney,
remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue
013 from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes
all possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and
Yankees have no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas."

Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at
the game.

Brian
