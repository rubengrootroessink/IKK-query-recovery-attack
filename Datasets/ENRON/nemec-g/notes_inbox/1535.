I have checked into this matter, and have found out that the below referenced 
invoice has been sent for payment.  Currently, it has been entered into the 
system and is in line for payment.  We expect the check to be sent out in 
approximately one week from today.  If you should need further assistance, 
please feel free to contact me.  Thank you.

Steve, could you check on the status of our invoice #21074601dated 2/19 for  
$  2613.61.  We received payment for our March invoice yesterday (thank you)  
and I wanted to make sure February didn' t fall between the cracks.  I am 
copying Gerald since I can't recall whether this particular bill went to you
