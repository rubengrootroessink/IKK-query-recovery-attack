 <<Gas Transaction Collateral Agreement(4-13-01)ENA.doc>>

Here is the latest draft.  I draw your particular attention to the
following:

1.  We have been told by El Paso that the contract assignment has been
approved and is being implemented and presumably will be done by Tuesday.
We have drafted the contract to be solely with ET Gas.  Lisa, you will not
need to reflect any additional parties in the Master Netting Agreement
amendement you are preparing.  Steve, the notice that you are drafting will
only apply to ET Gas.  Please e-mail those documents to everyone on the PG&E
team listed above.

2.  The text of Section 2 (c) is new, but it is intended to capture your
agreement that we will get $30 million in cash back and additional trading
margin when the capacity release is done, subject to current market
positions.

3.  Section 5 now punts the value calculation to an Exhibit.  We have
Barry's e-mail and are reviewing.

 I will be at home tomorrow for most of the day.  I can be reached at
301-320-2354.  I will also be checking voice mail.  I can receive e-mails at
lismeier@aol.com, but please also copy my work e-mail.

Thanks, Peter
