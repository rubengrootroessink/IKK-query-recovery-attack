     The days of the legal research cartel are waning as firms nationwide 
revisit the need for onerous ongoing annual contracts in favor of 
cherry-picking just the right tool for the job from an array of options 
spawned by the Internet.

     For years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous 
annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you 
can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it. Choosing the 
right tool for the job is easy once you know your options.

--THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE

     Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, high 
falutin' icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be very 
useful or very confusing and unnecessary. Its a fact that all of these 
enhancements have caused many attorneys to shun computer research.

     TheLaw.net, by contrast, is very easy to use and understand and it is 
affordable to all. Best of all, we provide a national scope the turns a blind 
eye to state lines and practice area boundaries.

     Our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for 
generations and accordingly, you may well always have a relationship with 
them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or otherwise. Certainly, 
factors such as practice-area, jurisdiction, organization size and culture 
all contribute to assembling what is, for you, the optimum matrix of tools.

     Experience teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world:

----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold
----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter
----you may discover that it makes sense to use these services only on a 
transaction basis when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, 
faster, for less money

     We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a 
business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of 
your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating 
unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning 
experiences.
See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate 
go-to resource. Specialists sometimes choose to cling to their elegant 
practice or jurisdiction specific slice of WestLaw, for example, adding us on 
as "meter insurance" for those occasions when The Plan doesn't cut the 
mustard.

     All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed developed the 
definitive best practices software solution for getting around online; a 
solution that allows anyone to instantly begin leveraging tens of thousands 
of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of their online 
enterprise.
