Hey there!  How are you feeling?

I was looking on the Northwest Airlines website for flights to China.  I am
thinking that we need to act on this pretty soon in order to get a good rate.
 So far I have found the flights that Cathy was talking about.  They are
approx. $795.00.  She had stated that she heard that the price was going to
go up to $1,400 after the first of the month.

Anyway, what do you think we should do?  Can you maybe talk with Eric today
or we can wait and talk to them this evening and try and figure things out!
