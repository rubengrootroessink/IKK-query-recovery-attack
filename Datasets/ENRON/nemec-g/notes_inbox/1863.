Hey there!

Sounds like someone decided to remain in bed for a little longer this
morning?  I was actually running really late myself.  I didn't get in until
close to 9:00.  Not what I was planning on doing this morning.

I have been working on a daily revenue report all morning trying to make sure
that it goes out with the correct information.  Don't want to have another
day like yesterday!

So, sounds like you a crazy day has already started for you.  Good luck.
Hope you don't have to work too late tonight.  By the way, what time are you
coming over tonight?  Thought I would be the one to ask! Ha!

Have a good morning....just tell all those clients that you'll get the stuff
to them on your own time and they can just sir back and relax!
