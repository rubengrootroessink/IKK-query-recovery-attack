Dear U2 Fan,

We hope you're enjoying checking in with U2.COM as it develops. In the run
up to Christmas we're introducing some new features which we wanted to let
you know about.

Following our competition  offering tickets to this week's New York U2 show,
we now have one offering a signed set of every U2 album on vinyl. So you
think you're a fan ? Test your knowledge on some tricky U2  questions!

We've also just put up our first poll of U2.COMmers - to find the fans
favourite track on the Boy album. Every two weeks we're selecting a new
album and, in the Spring, we'll have created an unofficial fans' collection
of the best songs on the first nine U2 studio albums.

Vote today and see what other fans favourite Boy tracks are.

Shortly, The Oracle is born.  Dubbed the 'surreal thing', you
can ask The Oracle anything at all about U2 and you will get an immediate
answer. Of sorts!

We'll keep you posted

Best wishes
