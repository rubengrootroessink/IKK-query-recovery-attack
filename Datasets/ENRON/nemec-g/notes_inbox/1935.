Listen-up Miss Hot Commodity!!

I think you are grossly mischaracterizing how you "asked us to consider" you 
for the band as the lead singer.  I believe you stated, "I AM THE LEAD 
SINGER!"...end of discussion boys.    And now you are making delusional 
threats that  past "has-been" bands (i.e. one Quiet RIOT) and some current, 
hip and notable bands (but for some reason they must remain anonymous) are 
all clamouring for your "services".  

Show business is tough enough without all of your diva bullsh@t 
attitude.....however we are willing to see past this and possibly hire you as 
a fly-girl dancer for our rap oriented shows due to certain physical 
attributes you possess....

Well, as I recall from the other night...I asked you all to consider me for
the band one more time and there seemed to be a bunch of hem and hawing.  In
my negotiations with Quiet Riot, I have discovered that I am a hot commodity
and many bands will be seeking me for their lead singer position.  I have
even heard that more recent bands (I cannot give out those names at this
time) have even considered asking their current lead singers to step down to
a back up singer position.

I am sorry that our relationship has deteriorated over this one incident.  I
tried to be fair from the beginning...but you all wanted to make sure that
you created an all boys band.  However, I am still hoping that we can resolve
this issue.  I cannot say that my asking price will be the same, given my
recent brush with fame.  Sometimes in life we make the wrong decision and I
am hoping that Monkey Pump will not make a mistake here.  However, if Monkey
Pump decides not to give me the chance to increase their potential of
success, I promise to still appear on VH1 and I promise to not say anything
about the band.
