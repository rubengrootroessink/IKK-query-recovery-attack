The information was sent to the FPSC staff on Tuesday, March 27, 2000.  Tom
did review the document prior to it being sent to the FPSC.  Gulf added a
small paragraph regarding the outages experienced on our 230kV system.  We
do not have access to AEC's information.  Thus, far we have seen no filings
from AEC or WFEC.

Russell,  I reviewed this with our business guys and they were fine with
what you represent here.  We did not check this with Tom Balcerowiz and he
needs to take a look at it.  Have your technical people gotten with Tom yet
on any of these issues?  If not then we can run it down on this end.

Our only concern was that reliability between Gulf's 230 kv system and
AEC's 115 kv system was not addressed.  It was our understanding that this
was a question of the PSC staff.  Are there plans to provide any
information concerning this item, or is no information available from AEC
for such assessment?

Any word concerning WFEC's response to our petition or any filings they
have made with the PSC?

Please review the attached document. Mr.  Bryant and possibly Tom on your
end may want to see this before it goes. I  hope to transmit this to PSC
Staff Thursday March 21, 2001.   Thanks
Russell
