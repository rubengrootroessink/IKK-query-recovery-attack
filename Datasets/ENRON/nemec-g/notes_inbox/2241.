Chris

Please find attached the CA for the intrastate pipeline opportunity that we
discussed. Please execute a copy and fax it back to my attention at
216-443-2993.

The Board meeting went well on Friday and the shareholders have decided to
sell all or a part of the intrastate pipeline system. As we have discussed
this pipeline has direct access to Chicago and Dawn and is the cheapest
transportation path into the heavily industrialized areas of northeast Ohio.
In addition, it is the logical source of supply for several gas fired
generating facilities being developed in northwestern Ohio. With McDonalds
assistance the Company is planning to put together an informational
memorandum and go to the marketplace in the next two weeks. Looking forward
to speaking with you further about this opportunity.

Sincerely

Andrew Redinger
