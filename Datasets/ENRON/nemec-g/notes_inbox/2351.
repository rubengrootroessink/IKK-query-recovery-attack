Gerald/Mark - I dropped off the Huber contracts as follows:

Trailblazer Assignment and Assumption Agreement - dropped off one original 
for execution.  The VP was not there to sign.  We should receive the executed 
original back from Huber this week.  Thereafter, all three originals go to 
Trailblazer for signature.

Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement - gave original to 
Brian Stone.

Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement #2 - Brian stated that he mailed 
the two "Huber" executed originals to Mark Whitt on 12/21/00.  I left the two 
(replacement) unexecuted agreements with him in the event Mark cannot locate 
those mailed in December.  Mark - do you have these?  Let me know ASAP.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase / Sale Agreement - dropped off two originals for 
execution (to replace the fax'd version).  Should get back this week.

Original Transaction Agreement - Brian only has a fax'd copy.  He wants to 
know if there is an original that exists.  Let me know if we have any 
originals or whether the deal was originally done over the fax.
