Gerald,

The dust is finally starting to settle here at work and at Laura's, allow
me to address a couple of topics:

     1)  I plan to be fully moved out this weekend except that I'd like to
leave me entertainment rack in your garage for a week or two while I try to
sell it if that's OK with you.
     2)  I put in a forward for my mail but is doesn't seem to be in
effect.  I called in a complaint yesterday but until then you may continue
to receive some.  I'll just have to check every couple of days.
     3)  I still haven't caught up with Eric at all, do you have his new
work number and email?
     4)  I don't know if you're getting any calls for me but in case you
don't have it, my new number at Laura's is 527-9460.
     5)  Lastly, we need to knock back some tonsil paint this weekend
sometime.  That will give me a chance to turn my key back over to you as
well and you can go back to walking around the house naked.

That's about it.  Talk to ya later,
Ryan
