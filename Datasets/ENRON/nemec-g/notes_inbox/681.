Gerald:

Generally, I agree with the comments in your memo.  As it emphasizes, the
factors that will ultimately shape this dispute and its outcome are the
facts.  What we really need now is to get a better handle on what effects
moving the Entrada/Dakota production to Badger Wash will have on Wildhorse,
and what Wildhorse  will say in response to Crescendo's proposal.
