Joan,

I am assuming that you will be forwarding a January Wildhorse letter.

I have a call into Gerald; I need one question answered on the agency
agreement.

I would like to discuss the swaption with you this afternoon.  I will be a
conference call at 2:30 to ??  I should be available after 3:30pm.  Let's
get that rolling as well.

Talk to you soon.

Ken Krisa
