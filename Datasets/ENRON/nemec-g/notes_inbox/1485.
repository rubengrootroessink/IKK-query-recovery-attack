Dear U2.COM Member,


A quick reminder that we are regularly enhancing U2.COM with new features
and stories:


* To mark the launch of the Elevation 2001 Tour in the US, we  have launched
a dedicated tour area updated daily with news of the latest shows, set lists
and live shots. http://www.u2.com/lite/index_tour.html


We also have live video footage from the opening shows and the unique Willie
Diary, our behind the scenes guide to life on tour with U2.
http://www.u2.com/lite/index_exclusive.html


* For tour dates and ticket availability, we have the very latest
information with online links to relevant venues.


* Our latest U2.COM poll aims to establish the most popular track from the
album POP. You can vote now, and, once we have a winner, you'll be able to
download all nine winning tracks from our polls of nine studio albums - your
own 'U2 best of' on your hard drive. http://www.u2.com/lite/index_poll.html


* The next five hundred customers at the U2 Shop get a free Anton Corbijn
print of the band, while we also have exclusive video  at the moment -
Larry and Bono disagreeing about Passengers as well as  belly dancing from
Achtung Baby. http://shop.u2.com/


For those you online via telephone connections, U2.COM is now offering a
HTML version with far quicker loading times and significantly more
convenient navigation  of the site. http://www.u2.com/lite/



Best wishes
