Barbara,
I wanted to thank you again for your assistance and insight in the Crescendo 
matters.  I particularly appreciate your effort to set up the meeting with 
Stan Horton.  The meeting was helpful and it was the right decision to go 
forward with the meeting.  By the way, I believe that Gerald is doing a great 
job.
Thanks again,
Scott
