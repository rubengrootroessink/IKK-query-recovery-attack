Thanks very much for the information on the PGE trading contracts.

Outside counsel is developing a form of "matrix" that they would like us to 
complete on each of the contracts.  I expect that you will have already done 
most of the work to complete that matrix with respect to your contracts, but 
we will need your help in completing the matrix and possibly digging up some 
additional information.  I will forward the matrix to you when I receive it.

I know how busy everyone is, and really appreciate your prompt response in 
this matter.  As you know, the situation in California is critical, and 
completion of this due diligence effort is key to our ability  to respond to 
the situation.
