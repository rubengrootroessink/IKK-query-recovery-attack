'Twas?a morning during the holidays and all over town, 
The screens were still blank, the PC's shut down. 
Other investors were all snuggled deep in their beds, 
While visions of stock quotes danced in their heads. 

My wife and I, without making a peep, 
Had just awakened from a decent night's sleep. 
When from my computer there came such a clatter, 
I jumped from my bed to see what was the matter. 

When what on the color screen did I view, 
But my Streamerc?service with 10 quotes that were new, 
Seeing all the new changes, I knew in a flash 
That I should buy and sell now to manage my cash. 

With a passioned frenzy I began to trade, 
Anticipating the outcome of the decisions I'd made. 
As quick as a flash, my results came into view 
Because of the speedy routing that Datek can do. 

Then with a twinkle I saw all I'd done, 
I updated my portfolio in less than 60 seconds. 
I sighed contentedly and stood up with a smile 
And realized all I'd done in such a short while. 

I slipped back into bed with only one thing to say. 
Happy trading to all, and to all a good holiday!
