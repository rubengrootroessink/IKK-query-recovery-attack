I'd like to hold off sending this to EECC until we have the PPA issues 
completely addressed.

Subject: Mooring Construction

Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating 
the changes we discussed.  I have not changed either the liquidated damages 
or force majeure provisions at this point.  Ron, you indicated in your voice 
mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect 
to those provisions.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the 
uncertainty on the two provisions.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks
