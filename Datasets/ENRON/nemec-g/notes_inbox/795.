Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what can be done to make it better.  That's why Enron wants to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's "Excellence 
Through Communication" employee survey to The Pulse.  This new name more 
accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis helps us 
correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Starting Monday, October 16, you will be asked to provide input into Enron 
and your work environment.  We would like to have 100% participation across 
Enron, because the only way to make things better is to know where we need to 
make improvements.


Will be available:  Monday, October 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Will be located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things you should remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desk via the intranet at survey.enron.com.  If you prefer, special 
computer kiosks will be available in some of our larger offices and group 
computer terminals will be available in smaller field offices.  We want to 
provide you with the most comfortable environment possible, as your 
participation is of vital importance to Enron.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey -- your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.

In last year's survey, employees identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:

* Educational/informational meetings, like Brown Bag Lunches and Executive 
Floor Meetings
* Flex schedules
* Improved PRC process
* Various employee newsletters, like Enside and eBiz

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you.
