Eric, Carolyn, and Yvette:
I will sent to you via interoffice mail, a copy (Carolyn you will get the 
original transmittal) of a confirmation of assignment of the referenced 
Interconnect Agreement.  The assignment was specified in the Interconnect 
Agreement as permitted at the counterparty's option, and as per my e-mail 
dated April 18th, Constellation has requested that the assignment be made.  
The document that I am forwarding is confirmation of the assignment of the 
Interconnect Agreement by Constellation Power Source Holdings (Rio Nogales 
Power Project) to Pinnacle Natural Gas (PNG Utility Company) so that our file 
is complete.  The Agreement to Interconnect and Operate Natural Gas PIpeline 
Facilities between HPL and Rio Nogales Power Project was executed April 17, 
2001.

Questions?: 713-571-3170
