The Exhibit B which he has suggested needs to be in sync with our gas quality 
specifications, a copy of which you can get from Shawna.  Once you have made 
this change, Jim Haden needs to review Exhibit B in total.  The other changes 
thay have requested are fine by me.  Please send me redrafts when you are 
completed.

I like the Interconnect Agreement that you sent.  I have just a few 
modifications.  I also included a mesurement and quality Exhibit B which I 
think we should incorporate.  You may have some suggested changes in regard 
to Exhibit B.

On another matter, I need a good faith cost estimate from Enron for 
constructing the Tap Facilities.  I need this in order to issue a purchase 
order.

Please review and get back with me, Thanks!
