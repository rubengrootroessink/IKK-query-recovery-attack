I've given the revision for the TSA to Lynn Dahlberg.? She is totally in 
agreement in the language and has even directed our Tariff department to 
revise the language.

Thanks for the quick turnaround. Didn't we have some TSA revisions as well?

Subject:? Precedent Agreement 



Stephanie, attached is the revised Precedent Agreement with the changes we 
discussed this morning.? Please note that the "board out" paragraph is now 
1.5 (previously 1.3).? I did this because it seemed more logical to insert 
this language after 1.4, if you look at the chronological order of the 
timelines.? Please let me know if you can live with this version of the 
Agreement.
