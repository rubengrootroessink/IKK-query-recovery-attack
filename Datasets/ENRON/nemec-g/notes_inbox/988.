Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.
