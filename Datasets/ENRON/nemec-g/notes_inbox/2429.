It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,
-Kevin

Hey Kevin,  How is it going cousin?  Found the napkin that you left your
email address on at Kenneally's.  Man, I really was loaded by the time I
left that place.  I went down to CC the next day and told my parents we had
met.  They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before
Christmas.  Small world!

How's Houston treating you?  Been back to Kenneally's since?  Drop me a
line when you get a chance.

Gerald,
