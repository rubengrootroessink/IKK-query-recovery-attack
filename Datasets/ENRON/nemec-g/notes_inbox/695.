To be so smart, but yet forget how to use a phone book or dial 1411 (HA
HA)!!!! FYI 713-645-4973.Try not to lose my number again or next time you
may not be so lucky!

On another note, "how about those horns"--I can't believe they lost. I
watched the game until halftime. I wanted to give you a hard time, but I was
afraid to. Are you going to the game this weekend? Are you nervous, UofH may
be pretty tough! I am headed to Arkansas for the Alabama game. Some friends
are picking me up in Little Rock and we are driving to Fayetteville. I can't
wait, it will be so much fun. Considering my flight leaves at 12:15 I AM OUT
OF TIME. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND AND IF YOU DON'T LOSE MY NUMBER, GIVE ME A
CALL NEXT WEEK--Emmye

Emmye,  I seem to have misplaced your work #.    Drop me a note when you
get a chance with your #.
