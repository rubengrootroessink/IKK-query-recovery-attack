Attached is the report.
The well kicked off and died a few times today.  Then we got the swab stuck
in the hole.  Should come out easily in hte morning.  Looks like most if not
all the production is coming from the middle and the upper.  Hopefully will
know more today.  The pressures are still coming down on the system.  Dale,
Wildhorse foreman, is going to start the compressor on the SA #19 tomorrow.
The plan is to start the compressor on the #3 the next day.  Esimated
production is 2,500 mcf.
I will talk to you later.
