Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just 
work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I 
may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.  Don't ask me how 
I pulled that off.

Are you ready to go back and use your time share?  


Good to hear from you.  Tell Shannon hello.  Take care.
