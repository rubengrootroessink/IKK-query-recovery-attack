Chris,  My comments are as follows:

 1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
of the current definitive term?

 2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
accomplished.

 3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".  Does this day match the gas day for 
the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 

 4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?
