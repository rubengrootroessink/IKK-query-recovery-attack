Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town 
for awhile.  

Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we 
get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.  

I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado 
in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I 
spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool.  
The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think 
it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley 
Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the 
inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception 
though.  

I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days 
down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and 
dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about 
being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying 
till 4 am and sleeping til noon.  

Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the 
pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter.  
Can't wait .

I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses 
that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I 
probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so 
much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get 
through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought 
you were going to graduate in December.  

It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when 
you get a chance.

Gerald
