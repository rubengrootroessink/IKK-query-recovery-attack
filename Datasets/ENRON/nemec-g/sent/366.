Randy,

I'd like to speak with you this morning.  I'm having Gerald research Texas 
law on: (i) failure of conditions precedent resulting in failure to form a 
contract  and (ii) breach of contract sufficient to afford termination as a 
remedy for breach.  Any help you can offer today in your shop on these 2 
issues would be appreciated.  Our guys want to issue a termination notice as 
soon as possible.  I want to know what common law of contract says before we 
do.  

Call me when you get a chance.

Steve
