Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
understand this after things have happened.

I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely 
work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You 
are my one true love.
