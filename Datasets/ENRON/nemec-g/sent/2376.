Steve,  Just talked with Barry.  He said based on last night's curve, the 
valuation formula would result in a value of $250 mil.  A detailed calc for 
this value will have to wait til Monday.

We will review this in the morning.  In the meantime, it would be extremely
helpful to know what the practical effect of your calculation would be.  In
other words, using this method, what is the valuation of each of the
packages as of today?  Please e-mail your calculation to each of us on the
PG&E team.  Thanks, Peter
