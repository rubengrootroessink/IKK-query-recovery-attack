    Second sentence  Upon cessation of deliveries of gas through the

MY COMMENTS
Interconnect 4th sen        Do we really want to change a definition?  Or did 
we accidentally define this twice?

Operations  second sen    NO-  It is HPLC that will be nominating the gas, so 
why would we try to balance with a nom that they are not making as the 
PURCHASER.  The buy/sell agreement should handle the volume in the attachment 
of a confirm that will go out as the deals are negotiated over a short term 
basis.

Item iv  instead of inserting continuous, we should say "analyzed monthly"  
because we will already have a proportional to flow sampler on it.

Finally, I am not happy with the language on the term.....I do not think that 
we should now name a term, otherwise, termination whould go with the new 
contract sent out.


Well, call if you get a chance to conference!  713-851-3815  cell
