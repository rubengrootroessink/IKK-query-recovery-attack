We have made contact in the East.  Looks like you had better start developing 
a taste for seafood.

Hey kids:

Greetings from Wuxi. The wedding preparations continue as planned. Just got 
back from another planning mission to Qingdao last weekend. We put deposits 
down on hotel rooms, restaurant and finalized the plans with the local 
Christian church. We were lucky to obtain the services of a very courteous, 
English speaking pastor named Mr. Dong. Mr. Dong will translate the ceremony 
into our native tongue for all big noses present.

I'm writing to you now to get your hotel reservations for your stay in 
Qingdao. We've put down a 2000 yuan deposit, but we must now secure exact 
lodging dates. Would you all please respond asap with the dates that you'll 
be staying in Qingdao? Everyone will stay at the Qingdao Dong Hai "East 
Ocean" Hotel. Most of you will probably be arriving in Qingdao on June 7th. 
The wedding is on the morning of the 9th. Do people want to stay an extra day 
after the wedding, or do they want to leave on the 10th after the wedding? 
Give me your plans and I'll fax them to the hotel management this week.

The big banquet dinner will not be immediately after the wedding ceremony. We 
couldn't find a suitable restaurant that wasn't already booked. We've moved 
the big wedding feast from noon to the evening of the wedding day. It will be 
at a famous Shandong style seafood restaurant. This restaurant has 
everything: snakes, frogs, scorpions, caterpillars, exotic marine birds, 
about 15 kinds of shellfish, and just about everything else you could imagine 
putting in your mouth that comes from the ocean, plus some things that you 
wouldn't normally imagine putting in your mouth from the ocean. It's kind of 
like going to Sea World and then pointing to a fish in the tank and telling 
someone how you'd like it cooked, except you'll be surrounded by a billion 
drunken Chinese tourists who will all be swilling ridiculous amounts of rice 
liquor and screaming, "Down with American Imperialism!" and "The East is Red- 
Long Live Chairman Mao!" Sounds great, eh?

So- please, tell me your planned arrival and departure dates to and from 
Qingdao so we can finish this monkey business with the hotel folks. Hope all 
is swell with everyone. I'll be in touch again soon. Adios.

Cheers,

Jon Gillaspie

Notes:

Ma & Pa- please get this info from the Staters and the Aines.

Eric- pass this on to Jennifer so we can get this info from Dan and Gail Junk.
