As per our conversation yesterday, I have a heightened concern about the CPS 
Interconnect Agreement as drafted, as it implies that HPL can perform at 
certain levels based on the facilities being installed.  This is incorrect in 
probably all cases, and I need your assistance in drafting a cover letter to 
help clarify HPL's position to CPS as to our ability to perform, and more so, 
our contractual obligation to perform relative to this proposed contract 
draft.  All this contract does is agree that HPL will allow the facilities 
they are requesting to be installed, subject to Tejas Gas' approval (JV 
responsibility), at their cost.  There is no commitment to flow any volume of 
gas on any basis under this agreement.  Any such obligation would have to be 
negotiated and agreed to in writing separately.  Please provide draft 
response.  If you have any questions, please call.
