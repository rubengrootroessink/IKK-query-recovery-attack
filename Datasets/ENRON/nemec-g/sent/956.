Hey Melissa,

I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow.  
We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review 
about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I 
guess I'll get through them.

Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at 
the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my 
tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.

We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next 
Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you 
told me at lunch!

Take care,  

Gerald
