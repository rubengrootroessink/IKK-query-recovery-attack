Mark,  Please review the attached letter and provide the missing date.  If 
everything looks good, I will prepare an original for your signature.  

Also,  do you have any resolution on the TW transport issue?  Is it 
acceptable for ECT to take title at the West Texas Pool and ECS still operate 
the transport agreement as its agent?
