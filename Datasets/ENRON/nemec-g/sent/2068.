Yes,  I was under the weather for a rough 4 or 5 days, but I am pretty much 
over it now.  I think I partied too hard in New Orleans over New Years!  
Impressive, on George Dubbya's invite list.  You must know some people in 
high places.  Have fun and give me a shout when you get back and we'll do 
something.  Later.

Hi.  I heard you were sick.  Are you back on the mend?  (Just spoke with 
Bruce -- he told me).  I'm leaving tomorrow to go to the Inauguration in DC, 
but when I get back we'll have to plan on dinner or a movie or something 
fun.  It's been a while.  Maybe those married friends of yours will make us 
dinner???
