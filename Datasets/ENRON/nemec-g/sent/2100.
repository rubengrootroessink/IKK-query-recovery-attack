Attached please find the execution copies of both O&M Agreements.  The only 
change I have made is the one we discussed at the end of Section 8.4.  Please 
let me know if you wish to discuss.

Jay, unfortunately, I would just print out these documents in lieu of the 
hard copies I previously gave you. However, keep and use the budget schedules 
I gave you.

Best regards.
