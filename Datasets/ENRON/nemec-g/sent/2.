Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?  If so did they recommend this 
specific language?

Subject: Sofregaz Agreement




Please find attached the latest draft of the proposed Capital Construction 
Term Rate Agreement with Sofregaz US.  I have not yet sent these changes back 
to Sofregaz yet.  Our (EECC) legal department approves these changes, but I 
wanted to make sure Gerald and Enron Storage Co. approved these changes.  The 
only changes made were to Section 19, General Indemnity.  This is a 
comparison copy showing the changes from our standard Capital Construction 
Agreement.

Gerald, the contract is with EECC, but Enron Storage Co. could use an 
Affiliate Work Offer.  I just realized that there is no Exhibit showing the 
Work Offer form, so I will correct that and make the work offers Exhibit F. I 
will attach a copy of our affiliate work offer for your review.

Please get back to me with any comments.  I will then reply back to Sofregaz.

Thanks.
Renee
