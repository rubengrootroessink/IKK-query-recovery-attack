Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted 
projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement



Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.



Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information 
available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as 
you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  
If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be 
used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would 
need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide 
these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are 
fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic 
idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal 
support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.
