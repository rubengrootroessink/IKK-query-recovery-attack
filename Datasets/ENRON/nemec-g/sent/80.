This is incredible.  The kid was a life long Aggie Fan, makes one trip to 
Austin and commits to UT.  I think we have finally found the guy to win it 
all for us (MB).   Also now Chance is saying he will actively recruit for 
us.  He wants this years class to be better than last years class.  I think a 
few phone calls to Roy Williams and BJ Johnson.  I can't wait til August.  

When are you coming back guy.  Are you ready for some football?

G$,

How goes it?  So how about Mack Brown?  He still amazes me with recruiting 
prowess.  Under Mackovic, getting Mock would have been an accident, but I am 
beginning to expect these recruits to start coming to Texas now.  Help me 
keep my expectations low!
