Gerald,

Following is one of the memos detailing some of the concerns about pressure 
differentials between HPL & MidCon.

Johnnie, 
I have a attend the A/A mentoring program this morning and won't be back till 
11am. 
if you need me, page me, 800-608-9432.
I am forwarding you this email I got from Brad last night.

I have run a flow study on the east side of HPL's Houston Loop to determine 
whether HPL can deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon during winter peak hour 
conditions.  The interconnect pressure will be around 600 psig, which will 
allow HPL to deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon with an 8" AAT-90 turbine meter.  
This is the full capacity of this particular 8" turbine meter.  The following 
assumptions were made in the preparation of this flow study:

1) The available gas pressure at Bammel is 900 psig.
2)  The Hardy Toll road mainline regulator is fully open, not taking any 
pressure cut.
3)  Entex being delivered gas at a peak hour rate, which is defined as HPL's 
historical peak Entex day plus 30%.
4)  The deliveries being made to both the Destec and Lyondell Channelview 
plants total no more than 60 MMCFD.

If capacity gets tight at Flagstaff, Gas Control can shut in the regulator 
from the Enerfin system to the 12" (3018) line to boost pressures.  Gas 
Control could also raise the pressure at Bammel to more closely track the 
MAOP of 936 psig on the east side of the Bammel loop.

Please note that if Bammel pressures are lower than 900 psig due to low 
inventory at Bammel, and Entex is on a peak hour delivery rate, then HPL will 
have difficulty making a 100 MMCFD delivery to MidCon Texas at Flagstaff.  
Increasing the turbine meter size to a 12" AAT-140 would solve this problem, 
but this would result in a greatly oversized measurement facility during 
normal operating periods.  A better solution would be to shut in the Enerfin 
and Maxey Road regulators to boost pressures on the east side and to attempt 
to limit Lyondell and Destec deliveries.
