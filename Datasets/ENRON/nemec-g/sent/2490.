We have two Summer Clerks coming in this summer which we have hired through 
the Houston Bar Association Minority Recruitment Program.   Majed Nachawati 
will be starting Monday May 21st.  He will be here 6 weeks and Alisha Mahibar 
will start on July 2 and be here the final 6 weeks.  

Enron Corp. also has hired two law summer clerks from UT .  These clerks will 
be doing 4 week rotations throughout Enron and we will have them each for a 
four week  period.  Dates are still being finalized.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the 
Global Market group this summer.

I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge 
of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan 
is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the 
groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would 
be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I 
will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.  Thanks for 
all your help.
