Rae,  Please print the cover letter on ENA letterhead and attached a hardcopy 
of the response.  I need to fill in Bridgeline's complete address on the 
cover letter.  Please check with Keagan to see if she has the address.

Brian,  Attached is our response to Bridgeline's issue list (revised based on 
our meeting) with a short cover letter.  I addressed the cover letter from 
you to Robert Morgan.  If that is not correct let me know.  I am sending a 
hard copy of these docs for your signature.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.
