I'll be there at 7:00.  Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be 
late.  Around 8:00.  She likely just meet us for drinks.  Is that a problem?

I made reservations at the Red Cat Jazz Cafe, 924 Congress between Main and
Travis for 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.  One catch...if everyone is not there
by 7:15 p.m. then they will yank our reservation because they have live
music and need the tables or something sketchy like that.  Anyway, see you
tomorrow...oh I included a reservation for Barbara so let me know if she
can't make it.
