Looks like we got another one.  Sounds like we duplicate the agreement we 
create for Ginger and use for this interconnect.  Let's discuss when we get a 
chance.

Hello!  I have been told that you are the interconnect guru.  I think I 
called you a couple of weeks ago with a warning on this one.  What 
information do you need from me to get started on an interconnect agreement 
with Tejas?  The purpose of this interconnect is to deliver 2-3 days of gas 
while we lower the line that feeds the city of Kingsville.  In addition, we 
will keep the interconnect in place as back-up to the city.  Please read the 
attached memo for additional details.  Please note that we would like to have 
this project completed within 3 weeks.

Per Billy Sheilds at Tejas, the cost for a 3" meter and tap is $ 27,000. The 
estimate does not
include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting 
HPL to provide.
To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a 
contract needs
to be entered into for all gas delivered from Tejas to HPL at this point. All 
cost incurred for
 the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas.
