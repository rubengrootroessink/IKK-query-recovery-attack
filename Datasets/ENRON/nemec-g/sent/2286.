Clement,  The form of Kern River guaranty is attached at the end of this 
email.    This is the form we would use for both the ENA bid and the 5 other 
third parties who have submitted bid on behalf of ENA.   Please review.

Clement,

Per my voicemail, attached below is the Gty format for Kern River.  The info 
is as follows:

Entities: ENA and Kern River Gas Transmission Company
Amount: $1.2MM
Expiration: 6/30/2003
Address: Kern River Gas Transmission Company
Attention: Paula Lauritzen
2800 Post Oak Blvd.
Houston, TX  77056

Again, it is extremely important that this gty is issued prior to March 26th 
(next Monday), as that is the absolute deadline that Kern River is giving 
ENA.  Give me a call if you need any other info.

Thanks again,
Veronica
