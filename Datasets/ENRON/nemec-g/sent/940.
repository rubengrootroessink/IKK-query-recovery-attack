Mark,  Attached are clean versions of the set of documents to be executed by 
Huber.





The following are redlines copies of the documents that were changed from our 
prior versions.






Mark,  A couple of notes:

1.  In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 
2.1 correct?  Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel?
2.  In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC 
Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs 
later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to 
Huber which we will effectuate soon.  Is this correct?
