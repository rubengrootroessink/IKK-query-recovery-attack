What do you need from me?  It is not clear from your note.

Subject: CCGM, L.P.

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above 
referenced counterparty.  The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation 
Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were 
forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999,  
Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and 
informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..  Further, she 
informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is 
free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because 
the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is 
subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another 
would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of 
Section 7.

Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions. 



Thanks.

Marlene D. Hilliard
