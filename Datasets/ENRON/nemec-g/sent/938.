Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.  
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to 
law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of 
glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken 
down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed 
on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

hi gn. so funny...terry and david are in my group. i don't know david as
well really, but terry is a good friend and is a total riot! i don't know
how well you got to know him, but he really is just great. anyway, i have
really been working with enron south america on the cuiaba project
exclusively for the past year and a half. the enron attorneys are randy
young and john novak. prior to that i did a few structured deals --
christina mordaunt was the atty.

yes, annie wu (we just call her "the wu") is a stitch! remind me to tell you
the story about when she came to visit me in london...and a few other
stories. she is a trip! truly a sweet person and a good friend too. i heard
you know my friend walter daniel, too. he was in my law school class and is
also a good friend.

whenever/wherever on the 14th is fine. do you like sushi? we could go to
miyako...or zydeco or becks? those are the places where i usually meet enron
folks since they are in between... let me know! mb

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they
keep you busy at V&E.

Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas
and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on
a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and
David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at
Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group.

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big
place, but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to
location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!
