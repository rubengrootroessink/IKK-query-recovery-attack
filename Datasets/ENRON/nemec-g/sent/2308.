Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation 
agreement.  We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not 
subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the 
Company's execution of the transportation agreements.

Please  review and let me know if you have questions.
