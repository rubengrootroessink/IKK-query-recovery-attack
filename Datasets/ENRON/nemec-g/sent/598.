Greg,  Attached is the document we discussed.  Please review.  Mariner is a 
party to this agreement since Mariner is performing all operations and 
maintence functions for the MEGS assets and this is consistent with the 
Operation and Maintance Agreement between Mariner and MEGS.  Please call me 
at (713) 853-3512 with questions.
