Gerald,

Let's meet tomorrow to discuss these contracts.  We need to put this issue to 
bed fairly soon.  Are you available at 1:00?

Regards,

Heather

Heather,  I did receive the Ash Handling Agreement from Bill White and I am 
reviewing and should have comments shortly.  I  have not received the Coal 
Handling Agreement yet from Kris' attorney.

Gerald,

Please give me an update on the redrafting of the ReUse agreements.  I 
thought you told me that their attorneys were drafting, but from this e-mail 
I don't think Kris Johnson is aware of that.  Please follow up with their 
attorneys and let me know when to expect a new draft.

Regards,

Heather Kroll

Heather:

Please give me a quick update on the status of the Lumberton and
Elizabethtown coal and ash contracts from Enron's perspective.  Are we still
shooting for a March 15th closing date.  As of now I will out of town on the
15th, but reachable.

Thanks, hope all is going well.
