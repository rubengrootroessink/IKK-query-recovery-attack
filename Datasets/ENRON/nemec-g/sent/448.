Gerald and Eric,
Attached is a redline of the Interconnect Agreement.  I have also included a 
letter that I want to send with the revised contract.  I have committed to 
respond early in the week of March 20th.  I will be out, but if you have any 
questions, please contact Ned Higgins.

Thanks, 
Greg Brazaitis
