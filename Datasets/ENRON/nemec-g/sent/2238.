Brant,  Attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised Credit Services 
Agreement with Bridgeline.  I made significant revisions to this document.  
In general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide 
a more detailed deal arrangement.  Please review  and if credit is OK, I am 
fine to send this to Bridgeline.  

Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.  The 
agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the 
services.  Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform 
the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee?  
Need to establish this before we send out to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.
