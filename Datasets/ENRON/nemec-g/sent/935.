Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would 
spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, 
then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob 
Vila's "This Old House".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you 
"commoners" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will 
recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside 
of 2 days.

Matt,  If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and 
Jen.

Eric and I can type up a couple of possible itineraries this weekend, based
upon some initial research. It'll include potential routes and possible
sights to see along the way. I think we can basically decide as we go. We
are also having dinner with someone Eric works with this Friday who has
been to Spain recently with his family. They went down to the Andulusian
White Hill towns near Seville. As you know, Eric and I were only in and
around Madrid, so we'll pick this guy's brain. I agree about packing light.
It sounds like we'll need a few sweaters though. I think it'll be between
50-60 during the day. I don't know if they have heat in Spain yet, so we
may get cold at night. I'm pretty confident we could find a laundry mat if
necessary. I don't want you to stink either, especially if you blow your
butt out like in Minneapolis! Nasty!!! Please bring your adapter. I blow
dry my hair in the mornings. Gerald will need to borrow it too in order to
dry his pomp. Eric and I felt that it would be easier to make our hotel
reservations once we get there. On day one, we arrive in the morning. Thus,
we'll have plenty of time to check out a couple of pre-determined hotel
options, especially since we're not in high season. We can discuss this
weekend.

Chao!

Peeps-

Is there anything that we need to do to prepare for the Crutial Clutch
Cargo
Gig that's about to occur?  FYI - I have an electricity adapter already, so
you won't need one if you don't already have one.  Jen, do you have any
idea
what laundry facilities will be like?  I'd like to take the least amount of
clothing as possible to avoid having much luggage . . . but, I don't want
to
stink for a week either.
