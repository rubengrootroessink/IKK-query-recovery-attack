Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the 
discussion we had yesterday.  I left the reimbursement provision open with 
only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the 
interconnect in some form.  I made some assumptions about equipment that 
either party would install, however this can easily be changed.

I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.  I think this would be 
best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if 
they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront 
payment before we buy or build anything.  Take a look at the draft and let me 
know if you have any questions.
