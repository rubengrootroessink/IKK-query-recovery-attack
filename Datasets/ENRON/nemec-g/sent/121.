Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard 
for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current 
situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break 
down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me 
through those times.

I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, 
helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each 
other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I 
don't have to think about all the pain.

We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just 
letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we 
can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either.  
However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your 
eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), 
but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, 
whatever happens in the near future.

I felt I just to had to write this email.

Gerald
