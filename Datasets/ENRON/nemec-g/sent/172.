I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment 
would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and 
ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any 
questions, please contact me a x33512.

Attached are some letters that Cheryl King from HPL has prepared. I think it 
would be more appropriate for you ( or someone from your group) to OK these 
as from reading the email, I gather that you do the legal work for HPL. 

Can I leave it with you to get with Cheryl King? 

Many thanks, 

Shari

I am forwarding this information to you because I do not know if Legal has 
reviewed her letters prior to sending them.

Here they are.  I will probably hear from Kathy later today as to whether or 
not they need any changes.



Since HPL Resources & Houston Pipe Line have several RRC System Numbers, the 
2nd attachment is the exhibit that goes with the 1st letter.  But, ECT only 
has one RRC System Number since they don't own any pipe, so that letter 
doesn't need an attachment.

Can you please send me a copy of the letters you sent to the RRC?

Connie,

I just wanted to let you know that since I was already working with the 
Railroad Commission (RRC) to get HPL Resources Company automatically replaced 
with Houston Pipe Line Company as purchaser on the P-4's, I went ahead & 
drafted a letter to do the same for the change from ECT to Enron North 
America Corp.  I faxed both letters to Kathy Way at the RRC, who is 
responsible for all automatic P-4 changes.  She will let me know if the 
letters look okay.  If so, I will need to get the appropriate officers to 
sign them & send them to her at the RRC.  Since she only does this at the 
beginning of the month & doesn't backdate the effective date, the change will 
be effective 10/1/99, assuming we have a P-5 in place for Enron North America 
Corp. before then.

The current P-5's are filed thru Gerald Nemec's office.  Will they be filing 
for this new one?  If not, do you want me to pursue this?  Please let me know 
so that we can get this completed in a timely manner.

Thanks.
