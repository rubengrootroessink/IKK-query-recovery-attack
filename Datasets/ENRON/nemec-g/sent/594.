GT,

Congratulations on the engagement!  Hate to see a good man go down, but it 
happens to the best of us.  Sounds like things are going really well for 
you.  When is the wedding?  Sounds like there are a lot of wedding bells in 
the Townsend family these days.

With respect to the weekend; change of plans.  I will be staying in Houston 
this weekend.  However, the following weekend myself and the red-faced Eric 
and possibly his wife want to come to Austin to hang out.  Are you around 
that weekend and could you handle 3 people crashing at your place.  If its a 
problem let me know.

G,

I will be in town this weekend but my sister is getting married Saturday so
I will be tied up until late Saturday night. Does that fit your schedule.

Also, I am now an engaged man. Heather and I are super happy but don't
worry, that does not change things buddy. I am going to need all the male
bonding I can get. Heather is going to Spring on Sunday so I have Sunday and
Monday totally free.

Let me know
GT
