The change order #4 for the compression was Fedexed to Ralph Townsend today.  
I am holding Change Order #5 the Dew Point Plant until we have the 
specifications.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald,
Where are we with this and the plant doc.  I know we are still working on the 
plant spec and scope, but I thought we were ready to go with the compressor 
change order.

Attached is a draft Change Order for the Electric Drive Compressor Station.   
Please review. Specifically note the Compressor Contract Price Sheet and how 
Merrick Modified the Target Price definition.  Also I envision using this 
same format for the Dew Point Plant Change Order

.
