Texas Utilities Fuel (k#012-88968-02-001) is trying to hold HPL responsible 
for imbalances incurred after October 1998, but according to the contract 
brief Texas Utilities Fuel  was assigned to ENA.  No one in contracts can 
find the assignment paperwork.  They don't know if it was misplaced or never 
done, and the counterparty was not informed of the assignment.  For our 
records and Texas Utilities' would you or, since your busy with Triple Lux, 
whomever in legal type up the paperwork.  Let me know what you need from me, 
and I will be more than happy to get it for you.  Thanks.
