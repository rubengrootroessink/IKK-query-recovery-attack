How are things going?  Haven't talked to you in a while.  As for me, I am 
fine.  Work is pretty busy right now.  We are at the end of the quarter and 
have to get certain deals closed before March 31, so it can get hectic.

My roommate will be leaving shortly.  He got a job opportunity with his 
family in North Carolina, so he will be moving.  Didn't last very long, but I 
knew that was a possibility when he moved in.  

Are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with Sharon.  It 
should really be a beautiful wedding up in Estes Park.  Very nice mountain 
scenery.  

Take care and I will talk with you later.

Gerald.
