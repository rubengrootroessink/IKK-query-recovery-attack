Paul, Attached are the documents for Greeley which are:

Master Firm Enfolio
Confirmation to Enfolio
Letter Agreement governing the Transport and Storage Arrangements

Please review specifically the Confirm and Letter Agreement.  I will give 
these a once more over and we should be able to send to Greeley tomorrow.
