Gerald,

Dude, what are you thinking about? Just kidding. I hope we kick their ass.
Listen.. send me the tickets overnight to 10300 hwy 290 east. Manor I.S.D.
annex office George Townsend Manor TX 78653. My bro will pay you 50 for each
again. Sorry you can't make it.

We are getting a chartered bus for the Big XII Championship so get tickets
and come to Austin. Have you been chasing any women lately? Pick a good
weekend and I'll come to Houston to watch or video.

Hook em
