Hello fellow Rice Alums (and other generous benefactors)!

It's that time again.....Rice 1999 Homecoming.  And we all know what that
means, don't we?.....

That's right, the complete and utter chaos at the

Tenth Annual

Bump, Stan, Kirk, Tim, Hugh, Mark2 and Jim??Rice Homecoming Tailgate Party?=
?The day:  Saturday, November 13, 1999??The time:  10:00 am till the beer's=
 gone (plan on using your headlights?when?you leave)??Where:  Rice Stadium =
Parking Lot--Entrance 12 off of Rice Boulevard??The game:  Uh, I think we'r=
e playing tackle football in that big stadium?thingie at 1 pm, but I haven'=
t bothered to find out against who yet (or for?the last nine years either).=
??But, as you all know, we do this without the help of the University (well=
,?okay, this year they're supplying Veldtman).  So why are you getting this=
?message??.....?.....?.....?We need you!??As we move from renegade tailgate=
rs to officially recognized renegade?tailgaters, we find ourselves with the=
 peculiar circumstance of having to?pre-fund the party, leaving behind the =
treasured Rice tradition of begging?money from the party participants at th=
e party itself.??We hate this. I mean, we really, really hate this.??Instea=
d of waiting until everybody's drunk and generous, we have to hope?that you=
're sitting here reading this, half-schnookered on cheap mescal,?too?drunk =
to find the bathroom in time, but still coherent enough to work a pen?and w=
rite a check.??You know the score -- parties happen because people make the=
m happen. In?years past, we've managed to find enough Jagermeister-blasted =
friends to?agree to sponsor a keg. This year will be no different -- we wil=
l find?enough sponsors, but only if you cooperate by getting yourselves dru=
nk for?us...??One bonus of sponsoring a keg -- you will be officially recog=
nized at the?party, and you will receive a commemorative certificate, suita=
ble for?framing. We are also accepting ideas for other expressions of our?g=
ratitude...??Since the alumni office has been perceptive enough to notice t=
hat everybody?goes to this party, they've decided to list us on their broch=
ure, and we?thought we'd take a page from their book and institute differen=
t levels of?giving to this oh-so-worthy cause.??As a result, we have develo=
ped the following levels which correspond?roughly?to the Alumni Office's le=
vels:???$15?Fajita Fund: Members of this society contribute to enable Chef =
Gustas to once ?again delight the party goers with his culinary expertise.?=
?$30?Beer Fund: Since each keg costs sixty dollars, many of our recent alum=
ni ?choose to sponsor half a keg, and they share credit on the keg itself w=
ith ?another Beer Funder.??$60?Sponsor's Fund: Sponsors are the backbone of=
 the annual giving for the ?Tailgate Party. Each Sponsor has undertaken the=
 responsibility of sponsoring ?an entire keg for the party. Without the Spo=
nsors, the Homecoming Tailgate ?Party tradition would not be able to contin=
ue as it has.??$????Founders' Society: This society is sort of like a cult.=
...Nobody is really ?sure how they got there, and no one seems to know how =
or why they stay. But ?in truth, each Founder agrees to contribute his port=
ion of whatever expenses ?remain after all other Funds gifts have been spen=
t. These Members are not ?independently wealthy, however, which is why all =
of the Funds and their ?contributors are so important to the ultimate succe=
ss of the Tailgate Party.??We are really late getting this message out this=
 year, but we promise that ?this year will be even bigger and better than l=
ast year's blowout.  And as ?such, please get those checks in now!  And if =
you're gonna contribute,?please e-mail Tim Graves to let him know (he's the=
 budget guy) at ?ttgraves@msn.com?so that we can tell the beer guys.??Send =
your much needed support to:??Tim Harvey?Computer Science Department?Rice U=
niversity--MS 132?6100 S. Main St.?Houston, Texas 77005??(Please make check=
s payable to Tim Harvey.)??(Also, if you include your email address on your=
 check, Tim will send you?confirmation of receipt of said funds!)??Or, if y=
ou would like to find out more, please call or email Hugh Kress at?(713-771=
-7671) or hkress@awd.com or Tim Graves at (713-668-2630) or?ttgraves@mns.co=
m or Kirk Oden at (210)-829-5126 or skoden@aol.com??We'll keep track of eve=
ryone who gives to the cause and let everyone at the?party know how much we=
 love you.??See you there!!!??Bump, Stan, Kirk, Tim, Hugh, Mark and Jim??P.=
