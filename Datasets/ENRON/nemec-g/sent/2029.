Nope.  Didn't piss me off.  I know how to interpret Mandy talk.   I just have 
been extremely busy.  Most of the other attorneys are gone and I am catching 
all their overflow.  

The days off were mellow.  Went to Corpus Christi to see the family.  Usually 
holiday cheer.  How about you?

Hey -
Good to actually see you.
I thought maybe you were on vacation or something.  You never emailed me
back - or did I piss you off?
I wasn't trying to be rude if so.  Just being good ole sarcastic me.

How were your holidays?
