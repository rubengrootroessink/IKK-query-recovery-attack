The letter looks fine.  I want to make sure that we don't record anything 
stating the ROW price.  If we need to put it in Exhibit B or something else 
which is not recorded, let's do so.  Thanks.

Gerald:

Paragraph 9 would be deleted for the Lonnie Claytor and Jennifer McIntosh
easements, only.  I changed the letter to reflect that.  Please also note that
I added a fifth item.

Thanks:

Joe
