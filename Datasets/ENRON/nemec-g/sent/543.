Lost my number eh?   A likely story.  Just kidding.  Sounds like you were 
pretty busy with family.  I had a pretty good Easter as well.  Mostly just 
hung out with friends and enjoyed the weather.  Of course I worked in a 
little jam session with my friends.  

The week is going pretty well.  Been in a lot of meetings and those just suck 
up the time.  I am leaving today at lunch to go to Enron Field.  The Cubs are 
in town and it is an afternoon game.  Should be fun.  The Astros really stink 
this year but the field is pretty awesome.  I am not a huge baseball fan and 
but outdoor baseball in Houston is pretty cool.

Good luck on the remainder of your schoolwork.  My numbers are:

(713) 942-8066 Home
(713) 853-3512 Work
(281) 772-9250 Cell

Take care,
Gerald

How wierd!
 I just logged on and was about to e-mail you.  We must be on the same
wave length or something.
 Yes, I survived.  I have a take home final due next Tues. and a 1 page
abstract due tomorrow, but that is it!
 I went home this weekend for Easter and was going to call you to see
how you were doing.  I could not find your # though anywhere.  I know
you gave it to me once, but I don't know what I did with it.  What is
your #?  Did you have a good Easter.  It ends up that I wouldn't have
been able to see you.  I came in late Fri. night, spent all day Sat.
doing yard work, went out with my dad and sisters Sat. night, and spent
time with the family on Sun.  Just wanted to let you know that I am not
trying to avoid you.
 How is your week going?  My dad asked about you this weekend.  I told
him we were still e-mailing each other.  He seems to like you.

Have a good day,
Katie
