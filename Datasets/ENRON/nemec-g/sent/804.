Eva,  All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior 
to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to 
closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

Since theTerm Conversion won't occur prior to closing, will you be deleting 
the references to it on  3.1(d), 3.1(k), 3.1(n), 3.1(q), and 4.5?  Thanks.  
Eva.
