Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a little early, 
so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a good time on 
Friday night?  How is everything going?

It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights last week 
to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of the new car 
with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points on Friday 
and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of him 
since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

 Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his are
flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians (sp?), a
place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get there at
about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head to the
downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends of mine
from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as well.  Are
you game?

 Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell: 281-687-6893.
I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

 later,
 E

 Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting
into
 Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281)
772-9250.
 If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't
you just
 call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll
ride
 over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing
with me.
 My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
wedding is
 at 7.

 Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

 G

Hotel Room Confirmation








 Gerald,

 Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129
rate.
 Below
 you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
matters
 which
 one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
They're both
 on
 my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

 I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from
SA.  I
 estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
right?)
 We'll
 actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family
from the
 Valley will be there as well.

 If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at
the
 hotel
 sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding
together
 from
 there.

 In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got
him a
 gift
 yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.
