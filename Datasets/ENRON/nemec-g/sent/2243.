I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to 
join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump.  
First of all,  you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the 
chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the 
market) and now you already discussing new ventures.  Secondly, Monkey Pump 
is not a stepping stone.  We are big time and those has beens "Quiet Riot" 
will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.  

I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the 
Music: Monkey Pump episode.  

"Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first 
album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really 
sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on 
reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago.  When we return on behind the 
music............"
