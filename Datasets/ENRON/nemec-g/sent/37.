Mark,  Please review the attached form of amendments.  I have also prepared 
the form of amendment for the O&M Agreements, but will hold until you get 
further information on the fee arrangements.

After you review these forms, lets discuss and review where we are at in this 
whole process.  We will need to get TW, Accounting, and Investor review of 
these as soon as possible.
