Yes, I did receive it.  I have been out of the office on a due diligence the 
last couple of days.  I will review and get back to you tommorrow.  Thanks.

Mr. Nemec,

Did you receive the latest WIC supplement dated 10/12/99 ??
I read it and didn't have any problems with it. It gives us VOLUMETRIC firm 
rights at 80% of the max. recourse rate on the excess ramp up volumes.

The supplement letter agreement has Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corp. 
which can be crossed out and changed - I talked to WIC about this already.
The FTSA has Enron North America Corp.

Let me know.

Mike
