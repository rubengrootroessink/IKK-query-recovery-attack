Wanted to make sure you had the latest docs.  I discussed with Barry and the 
MDDQ section was not changed since this version.

Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed 
today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity 
of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility 
this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss.
