Bruce,  Attached is an article I found in the Houston Chronicle business 
section yesterday.  Has a negative outlook, but mostly related to product 
supply B2Bs.    You probably are familiar with most of the B2Bs they 
mention.  Thought might be useful to you.  Good talking to you yesterday.  
The check better arrive this week or I start breaking your stuff one piece at 
a time.
