Did you ever receive these documents?  If so, I need the originals.

Chris,
Huber has executed the following documents today:

1. Trailblazer Assignment and Assumption Agreement signed add'l
original

2.  Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement #2

3.  Enfolio Master Firm Purchase / Sale Agreement replacing a
previously executed "fax" version.

I will overnight the documents to you.  Please have them executed and
return one of each for my files.

Thanks for your help, and best of luck in your new venture at Enron.
Brian Stone.
