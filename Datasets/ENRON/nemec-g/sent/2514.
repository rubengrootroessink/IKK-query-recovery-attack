Greetings!  Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe.  Sitting at my desk trying
to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs.
Ruppert is kind of freaky too.  I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which
I've
become accustomed to in the last couple weeks.

Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing!  Everything I could have wanted
and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time.  The trip there was

quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all.  we got settled into

Athens around 4 p.m. Monday.  Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful

view of the Acropolis.  Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are
kind
of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling

me, I mean its a big city.  We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I

try to avoid large groups of formal tours).  We took a ferry to Santorini
and stayed there for 3 days.  Loved it!  We ate some faboulous restaurants
on cliffs overlooking the water.  Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables,
bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove

all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to
absorb the rays.  Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we
didn't bring swimsuits.  As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of
the
culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs.  Ryan surprisingly left
his
shorts on this time???  Loved the black beaches!  We tried to find a more
private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our
attempt.  We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing.
We
drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed
in rock with a few tavernas.  so we had dinner there and watched the
sunset.
  The most amazing seafood!  They took us in their kitchen to show us what
they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's
request being a geologist and all.  We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and
then
of course back down.  We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so
hot, I did not venture in the water.  After the ride we had to get all the
way back to the top so we took donkeys of course.  Quite an adventure as we

were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff!  Luckily
mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought).

We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so

we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great
people which we later went out with that night.  You all should have seen
Ryan at the discos!

Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini.
Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and
slept.  Loved this island a lot.  Not as touristy and the greeks were very
pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer.

All in all the wedding was fabulous.  I was very happy with the wedding
festivities too.  And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast.

The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the

night before.  I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal!
The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about
everything!  Its just so overwhelming.  One of the best parts was sitting
on
the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and
people's faces lighting up.  Knowing that all those people were there to
share in our special moment was just so wonderful.  Of course I wish I
could
have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you.  We were
so
honored you all traveled so far for us!

I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest
I've ever been!  Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.  I hope
you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves.  Everyone was
surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed
in
you gals!  Except for Falb she always pulls through with something!
Anyway,
love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well!

Forever Gams!
