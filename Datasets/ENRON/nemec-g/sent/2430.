Ann,  Sorry for not getting back to you on this.  I have some answers on the 
issues that were on my to do list.  It might make the most sense for me to 
comment in response to your memo dated March 8, and forward to you.  I know 
there were several items that you were checking with your people and I would 
note those.  Let me know what you think.

Hello Gerald,

I just wanted to drop you a line to apologize for not getting the letter
response out to you.

Do you know if Russell contacted the Canadian office about issuing the
Canadian draft agreements for review and finalization with the U.S.
contracts?  I thought that was his intent, but we have received nothing as
yet.

Have a wonderful Easter holiday!

I will try to address first thing next week.

Talk to you then.

Tx.

Ann
