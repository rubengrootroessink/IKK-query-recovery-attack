On the Sofregaz Agreement, I changed the Excess Umbrella Liability Insurance 
coverage to a $10,000,000 amount.  This was noted in a letter to Normand 
Grenier, Sofregaz's Attorney, and they had no objections to this.  I forgot 
to change this amount on the contract I sent for internal review, but it was 
changed on the contract that I sent to Sofregaz for execution.  Please find 
attached a copy of the final document I sent for execution showing the 
$10,000,000 excess liability amount.
