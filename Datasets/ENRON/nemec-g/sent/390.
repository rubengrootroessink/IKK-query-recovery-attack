Nice job on the photos.   Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain 
times.  The good thing is that the "Dude" I met in Joe's and I are now pen 
pals and he will be coming to Houston to visit very soon.  Maybe he was my 
long lost brother.  I am making a phone call to my Mom right now too see if 
she has anything she wants to explain to me.
