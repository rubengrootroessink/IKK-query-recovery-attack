Gerald,

Sorry for the call in the middle of the night.  My well is drilling and I
asked them to call me if they got an oil show.  The well should reach total
depth on Sunday so you might want to turn your ringer off in the bedroom
until then.

-Ryan

Ps.  Are you in for the Christmas Carol at the Alley tomorrow?  I need to get
rid of the tickets.
