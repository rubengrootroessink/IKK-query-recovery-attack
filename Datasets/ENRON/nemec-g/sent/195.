Gerald -

Here is a copy of the scoping document that I passed along to Glenn Gregory.

Thanks,

Glenn,

Mary Jo Johnson is working on a facilities agreement with Mobil to 
interconnect the Spanish Camp 6-inch line to the Mobil 14-inch Vanderbuilt 
pipeline.  HPL will be responsible for setting a 6"x6" tee, riser, and 
above-ground valve on the Spanish Camp lateral.  I suggest the 6x6 because 
the gas sales contract that will go along with the facilities agreement 
should specify an HPL scheduled delivery rate from 0 to 20,000 MMBtu/d.  The 
6-inch will minimize pressure losses off of the Spanish Camp line and will 
maximize our ability to expand this point in the future, if necessary.  
Assume that we will need to acquire a small section of surface easement for 
the above-ground valve.

Looking at our as-built drawings (HC-1025-09-H) it appears that the Mobil 
line crosses the Spanish Camp 6-inch at Station Plus 77+40 in the middle of a 
pasture.  I spoke with Lonnie earlier today, who said that he would be in 
that area on Wednesday and can verify that I have correctly located the 
line.  The crossing pipeline is incorrectly identified as a 16-inch Natural 
Gas line on the as-built.

Mary Jo has asked for some agressive timing on setting the tee, in that she 
would like to have it set for an 1 October, 1999 completion date.  In that 
light, would you please approach this from the perspective of preparing a 
work-order rather than a preliminary cost estimate.

If any of these specifications change, I will let you know immediately.

Thanks,
