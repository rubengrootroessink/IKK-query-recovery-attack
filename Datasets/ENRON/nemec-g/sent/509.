Since our last email described the closing of La Joie du Vin, we have been
asked a number of times about the existence of any other, similar groups
dedicated to enjoying and learning about wine.  The Wine Society of Texas is
just such a group.  They have extended an invitation to our members and
friends to learn about their organization and participate, either as guests
at events or in an organizational capacity.  We encourage you to take a
moment to read to following introduction and consider supporting and
participating in The Wine Society of Texas.  Their mission and goals are
admirable and we all, as wine lovers, will benefit as those goals are
realized.

Sincerely,

Greg Giordano



From  Dr. R.D. Kane, Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President, Wine Society
of Texas

Greg,

Per our telephone conversation today, I would like to forward this
 message to you and the members in your organization. As we
 discussed, the Wine Society of Texas is a statewide 501(c)3
 educational organization with approximately 350 members in Texas
 and about 120 in Houston. We also have chapters in Austin, San
 Antonio and two in the DFW area. Our mission statement
 (paraphrased and shortened) is to help develop a wine educated
 consummer base in Texas and to support charitable organizations
 and responsible consumption. Unfortunately, some people confuse
 this message with only working with or interest in Texas wines. But,
 this is far from the truth.

 The WST has been working to provide education on wine tasting,
 wine making and grape growing in a pleasant social setting. The link
 to the local wine industry has been a great asset that has helped
 provide first hand experiences in grape growing and wine making.
 Personally, I have picked and crushed and this has given me have a
 much better appreciation for this part of the process everytime I
 down a glass of wine. However, we have also been trying develop an
 awareness in Texas regarding the benchmarks in fine wines, so that
 consummers increase their knowledge of fine wines from around the
 world.

 This latter point is one that is illustrated in our upcoming event,
 Springfest 2000, on March 24-26. The festival event will be held in
 Old Town Spring Texas and the premium events (Vintner Dinner and
 Grand Tasting) will be held at the Hotel Sofitel near Bush IAH.  We
 will have specialists in grape growing and wine making talking about
 new varietals in Texas, some of which have their "roots" in other
 similar regions of the world such as those from Rhone, Spain and
 Italy. We also the Art Institute Culinary School their to give wine and
 food preparation demos. Our Vintner Dinner (Fri. 3/24) will feature a
 special pairing of wines from Texas and France featuring
 Chardonnay and Rhone Blends.  At the Grand Tasting and Media
 Choice Awards Presentations, (Sat. 3/25) the attendees will be
 tasting the best of the wine submitted for judging and vote for their
 favorites. Springfest is a charity event that is raising funds for the
 American Heart Assocition, the Old Town Spring Preservation
 League and the Wine Society of Texas Scholarship Fund. More
 details are available at:

I welcome you and your members to
 check out the WST and Springest 2000. If you have any questions,
or would like more information, please contact me.

Regards,

Dr. R.D. Kane
Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President
Wine Society of Texas
