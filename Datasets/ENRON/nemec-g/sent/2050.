GT,  Hey Bud,  Yea that Holiday Bowl was heartbreaking.  Never seen three TD 
passes dropped.

Unfortunately, I don't have Ernie's number.  He called me one time at about 
11 pm on a Saturday from someone's cell phone he had borrowed and left no 
number.  Typical Ernie. 

How are the wedding plans going?

G,

How's it going?  The horns had a decent season I guess.

Hey, do you know how I can get a hold of Ernie?

Let me know.

GT
