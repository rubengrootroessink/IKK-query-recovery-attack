G-

This looks fine to me.

One follow-up question re: Kennedy North Kitty:

As part of the original Kennedy deal, we purchased some gathering lines from 
Kennedy that he had constructed from the wellhead to a pod.  However, we 
never executed the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Should I (Mike or Ken) 
pursue getting this document in place with Kennedy ASAP?

Thanks.

Dan
