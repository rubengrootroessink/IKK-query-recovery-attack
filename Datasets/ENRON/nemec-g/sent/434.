GT,  Sounds like things are going well.  Can't wait to check out the house 
and Heather.  As for myself, I have been hanging out with Cynthia.  Met her 
through a friend.  I guess we are dating.  Not to anxious to stay with one 
girl at this point.  

I'll let you know more early next week about the road trip.  Take care.  

 You wouldn't happen to know someone who could get us cheap South by 
Southwest passes.  We think we will need those passes to see Tenacious D.

G$

Gerald,

How are you buddy? Good to here from you. I will have room for you on the
18th but my nephew will be staying at my house and maybe my mom and neice
too so Eric really needs to get a hotel room. The couch is waiting for you
dude. I only have dinner plans for the 18th. There is a Mardi Gras party to
go to on the 17th thrown by the No Le Hace bunch. Let me know if you are
coming into town.

Are you dating anyone? I am dating a young thing named Heather. She is
really cool.

The house is looking good. They are doing brick work on the front as we
speak.

Hope to here from you.

GT
