Heinifer,

A few corrections:  Jeff and Cathy call each other "boo" not "pooh".  
Secondly, with your threats of my arse being kicked, I must say that violence 
solves nothing, but if you wanna dance tonight, bring it on.  Third, it is 
not a "supposed" conference call just because you didn't plan it or have the 
idea, IT IS A GO!  Fourthly, & oh yes Fourthly is a word, anyone who wants to 
can "present"  their ideas & suggestions  (or demands if your a Nazi) on the 
conference call.

Lastly, 
I can't wait to get drunk in a foreign country with all of you.

It's all fun and games until someone gets their butt kicked. I think you
are mistaken me for Cathy. She's the only one I know with the name pooh
bear.

By the way, on this supposed conference call, who all is presenting
information?

It'll be too cold and I'll complain about being cold the whole time. Plus,
it's not as interesting as Spain. Matt, you could wear cute little
bullfighter pants, with knee-high white socks and a sexy beret atop your
noggin. The hot-blooded, salsa-dancin', dark skinned, beautiful spanish
maidens will be falling all over you. You don't want frompy, belching,
stinky armpit German women chasing you around, do you? Or, do you?

Eric, to your little Illinois/Nazis comment below that you didn't copy me
on, well...You suck! And you'll pay later for that, dear.

What's the problem with Germans?  I tend to like them . . . very strong
and verile people.  A handsome people.  Plus, they love to drink beer.
AND, I would like to wear some of those little shorts that have
suspenders attached with cute little buttons and dance a little jig with
a big stein in my hand.  What is wrong with that?
