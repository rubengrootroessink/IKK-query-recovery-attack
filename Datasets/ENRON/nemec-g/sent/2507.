Dear Customer,

Thanks for your inquiry regarding NewPower's 500 home technology pilot in 
Houston, Texas.  Please note you do not need to be a NewPower electricity 
customer to participate in this pilot.  The technology pilot is a separate 
program.  If you have already signed up for this pilot through some other 
means (such as in the lobby of the Enron building or via fax) please 
disregard this message.  Sears will contact you to schedule you installation 
within a couple of weeks.

Below you will find the electronic version of the NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution brochure and application (NewPower trifold.pdf).  
To participate in the pilot, simply:

1)  Launch the PDF File (NewPower trifold.pdf) Note:  You will need Adobe 
Acrobat Reader 4.0

2)  Scroll down to the second page of the brochure where the application is 
located

3)  Print out the brochure/application

4)  Fill it out and fax it back to us at 914-697-2482 (to the attention of 
NewPower Connections)

 or

5)  Mail the completed application to us at: The New Power Company
      One Manhattanville Road
      3rd Floor
      Purchase, NY  10577-2100
      attn:  NewPower Connections


Sears will call you in two to four weeks to schedule the installation.  
Remember, the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot 
program is completely FREE to the first 500 participants.  Free hardware, 
free installation, free service calls, and no monthly service fees or hidden 
charges.  At the conclusion of the pilot, those first 500 pilot participants 
will be "Grandfathered" so Remote Energy Management will remain free to them 
should the service be continued as a real mass market product.  



Remember, to participate in the pilot, you must meet the following 
qualifications:

1)  You must reside in the Greater Houston Area.  The outer limits or our 
service area generally will include Kingwood, The Woodlands, Tomball, Katy, 
Sugarland, Pearland, League City, and Baytown.  Reliant Energy / HL&P should 
be your current service provider.

2)  You must own and live full time in a single family home (No Apartments 
Please).

3)  You must have internet access either at work or at home.

4)  You must NOT have any other Powerline Carrier Devices currently installed 
in the home (Such as X10 Devices).

5)  Your home must have central heating and air conditioning.


Please let us know on the application if you have a Dial-up or Broadband 
Internet connection at home.  If you do have broadband, please advise if it 
is DSL or Cable and who the service provider is (i.e. PDQ.net, SBC, 
Earthlink, etc.).  Just write it anywhere.















If you like our NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution, feel 
free to forward this brochure and application to your friends and family.  



Thank you,
The New Power Company
