Hi Katie,
 How is my favorite Aggie?   Its been a hectic week so far.  This deal is 
scheduled to close Thursday morning and then a I catch a flight to Denver 
Thursday afternoon.  I have been putting the guys off in our Denver office 
for some time so I will be busy with them all day Friday and then a flight 
back to Houston on Saturday.  Denver is a cool town, so it should be fun on 
Friday night.

How is the research project going?  Any major breakthroughs in the health 
area.  Remember me when you win the Nobel Prize!

Gerald
