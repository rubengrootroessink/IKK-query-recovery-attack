Tracy,  

Thanks for the pictures.  Cute kid.  Frank does look like you.  I need to 
come by and see Frank in person.  Sorry that I have been out of the loop for 
some time but sometimes life is weird.  

I am sure Tom told you that Lisa and I are getting divorced.  It is still 
hard for me to comprehend this, but all I can do is continue to move forward 
with my life.  Anyway, hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending 
pictures.   

Gerald
