Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an 
Associate here at Enron.  I had worked with the Associate before but don't 
know his friend.  I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring 
needs, but that I would pass the resume along.  Barbara indicated you were 
our recruiting coordinator.  So here it is.
