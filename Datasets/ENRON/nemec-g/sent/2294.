Heather,  Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the 
Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.  I made a few further changes to the 
Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.  Please review and let me 
know if you have any questions.  Both docs do have a few questions inserted 
where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.  Sorry for 
the delay.
