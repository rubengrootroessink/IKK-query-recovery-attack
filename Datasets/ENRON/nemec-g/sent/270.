Subject: Transportation Gathering Contract for HPL transporting on HPL

Gerald,

Due to some changes in our business, we are needing to amend the current 
transportation contracts for HPL transporting on HPL.  We will need to amend 
the current 012-41500-02-003 contract, covering the transportation cost from 
a particular wellhead all the way to Houston Ship Channel, to become two 
contracts, one we call the "gathering agreement" (covering transportation 
cost from the wellhead to a competitive supply curve like Thompsonville zone 
or Agua Dulce zone) and then another agreement we call "marketing 
transportatin agreement" (covering transportation cost from the competitive 
supply curve to Houston Ship Channel).

We need these amendments to be effective as soon as possible since we are 
targeting making the administrative changes effective during November 
production month.  I tried to call you but was not able to be connected to 
your voice mail.

I would like to sit down with you in the next couple of days to discuss this 
change and what we need to do to have the agreements changed and the new 
gathering agreement put into place.  Please respond via email or call at 
3-1836 to discuss this issue further.  Thanks!


Heidi Withers
