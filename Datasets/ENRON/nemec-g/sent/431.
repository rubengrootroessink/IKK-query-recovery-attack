Attached is the EnergyShare 2000 Agreement with my revisions included.  
Included is both a clean and redlined version.  I did not review in detail 
the payment calculation methodology.  I will leave this to Mark Courtney and 
John Scarborough for their review.  Please feel free to call me at (713) 
853-3512 if you have any questions or wish to discuss my revisions.
