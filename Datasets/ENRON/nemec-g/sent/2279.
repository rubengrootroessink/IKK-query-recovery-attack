Some thoughts that might help from time to time.  This was forwarded to me, 
and I found it very compelling.

Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one 
so 
that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful 
for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often 
times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has 

been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a 
porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it 
was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what 

we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've 

been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an 
assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait 

for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in 
yours. 
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, 
and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't 
go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. 
Go 
for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark 

day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. There are moments 

in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from 
your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where 
you 
want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one 
chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to 

make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you 
human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. 
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The 
happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just 
make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for 
those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have 
tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have 
touched 
their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a 
tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you 
can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and 
heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was 
smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling 
and everyone around you is crying. Please send this message to those people 
who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or 

another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that 
make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those 
who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship. And if 
you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss 
out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message.
