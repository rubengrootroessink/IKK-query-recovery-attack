I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie
Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to
send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal.

Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey
and Gerald.
Thx

Ken Krisa
