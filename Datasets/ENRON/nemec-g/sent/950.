We have scheduled a Project HIWAY demo for Tuesday, November 14, starting 
with lunch at 11:30.  The demo will be held in room 49C3.  At this time we 
will bring everyone up to date regarding the web site project of allowing 
shippers and operators of HPL the ability to access their respective contract 
and meter  information in a secured internet environment.  We will also 
discuss plans to allow shipper nominations and operator confirmations over 
the net.  

If you have any questions, please call.
