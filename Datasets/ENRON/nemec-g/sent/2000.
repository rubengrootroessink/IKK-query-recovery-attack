Can't I say Hello to Mandy without a specific reason for doing so?  Actually, 
you copied me on a joke email earlier in the week.  Just thought I would see 
if you would talk to me.

still no word on the Hawaii job yet --
Just got word that I'm number one pick for the Pennzoil job, but that they
wouldn't be ready to do anything until after the first of the year, which
is fine by me.
I'm going to London 1/10 through 1/16 - did I tell you that arleady?

so, you didn't answer my question:  what made you say hello all of a
sudden?  I thought you were gone for good.
