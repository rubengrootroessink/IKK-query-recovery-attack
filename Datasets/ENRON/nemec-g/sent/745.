Hi Emmye,  Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  It has been 
extremely busy here at work and I am leaving for Denver today at 5:30 so I am 
really having to hustle to get things done before I leave.  How was the 
wedding?  I know you really were just looking for any excuse to go to Tomball.

I too had fun on Thursday.  I will give you a call when I get back from 
Denver. I will be back on Sunday.  Take care and talk to you soon.

Gerald
