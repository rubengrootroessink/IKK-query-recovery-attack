Andrew, Gerald

Attached is the meeting notes from a 1 hour meeting we had with Cantera
Resources and Tom Brown on April 24.  We will be meeting with them again on
Monday, May 7 in Dallas.  This meeting will involve the president and
operations manager of Cantera as well.  While the last meeting was more of
introductions and high level "where we are"  and "what are the issues"
discusssion, this meeting will be more definitive where we plan to discuss
the pressure and curtailment issues in more detail, and we will be
discussing moving the Entrada from San Arroyo to our plant.  I am sure they
will also want to discuss some sort of agreement for us to move foreward
together on the low-Btu project.   Tom Brown representatives will be
involved via phone - as they must until the deal closes.  We told Cantera it
may be a very short meeting as there are certain things we won't talk about
in front of Tom Brown.

In our meeting on Monday - which will start at noon with lunch, I want to be
able to show them a couple of things.  I want to show them Graphs 2-2.1-A
and 2-2.1-B and Figure 2-2.2 out of section 3 of the Contract Issues book I
gave you.  I want to also show them Graphs 3-2.1-A and 3-2.1-B and Figures
3-1 out of section 4 of the book.   I was not planning on discussing the
monitary value associated with these graphs (the sum of these issues totals
just under $1MM economic harm to Crescendo as I calculated from June through
December 2000.)

Andrew, I will call you in the morning to discuss in more detail what we
should and should not show them or discuss concerning the issues.  I will be
on my cell phone at 915-349-8223 all morning.

Thanks,

Ken Krisa
