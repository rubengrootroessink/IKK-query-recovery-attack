Greg,  I thought that was for the Rio Nogales project.  The Brazos Valley 
interconnect has no specific provisions for assignment to Pinnacle.

Gerald,
We have an executed Corporate Guarantee from Constellation for the work to be 
done at the Interconnect.  We estimate the cost to install at $100K.  The 
guarantee is for $300K.  Constellation will be responsible for the costs even 
if the Interconnect is assigned, as is permitted by the Interconnect 
Agreement, to Pinnacle (PNG Utility).

Greg
