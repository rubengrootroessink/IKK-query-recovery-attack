Hi Katie,  So far so good.  Busy but moving forward.  It will be interesting 
to see if I catch my flight or if I have to delay it some.  Denver should be 
nice.  I was watching the weather channel and it appears that it will be 
pretty cold up there.  I saw something about lows in the 10-20s.  Yikes!  
You're right though. I enjoy traveling every once in a while for a change of 
pace.  The guys I work with up there are fun, so that makes the work go alot 
easier.  

Take care and talk to you later.
Gerald

Hey Gerald!
 I'm doing O.K.  How are you?  Mon. and Tues. were busy, but the rest of
the week shouldn't be too bad.  The research project is going well,
except that a lot of the articles we need have to be ordered because our
libraries do not carry the journals.  That's probably typical though.
Tomorrow we have a big meeting with my prof to come up with an outline
for the project, so things should really start falling into place pretty
soon. Starting next Mon. I will be volunteering for the Health-for-all
clinics Health Educator (we have to volunteer for one of my classes).  I
will be helping diabetics and people with high blood pressure plan their
diet and physical activity schedule.  I'm pretty excited, but still need
to read up on nutrition since I am a little rusty.
 Denver, huh?  It will be so beautiful.  I've only been to Colorado once
to ski.  I wasn't too big on the skiing thing, but I did enjoy the
scenery.  You will have a great time.  Do you like that you have to
travel every once in a while for your job?  I would think that it would
be nice to get out of Houston every once in a while.
 Did it rain in Houston last night?  THere was a huge thunderstorm here
around 4:30a.m.  It almost sounded like it was hailing for a minute, but
I don't think it did.  I heard Ft. Worth got it pretty badly.  Three
people were confirmed dead today.  On a lighter note, have fun on your
trip!

 I'm not so sure about the Nobel Prize thing, but hey... it would be
nice.

Take care,
Katie
