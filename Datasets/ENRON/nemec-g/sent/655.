Bob,  Attached is the form of Agreement we need to use for ForeRunner.  It is 
the same form we used for High Mountain.  We need to make sure it reflects 
design and engineering services provided.  We will also need a Tasking 
Letter.  Ken Choyce should be able to provide a contract at ForeRunner as 
well as scope of work.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
