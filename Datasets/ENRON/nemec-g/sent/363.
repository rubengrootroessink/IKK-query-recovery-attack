It worked,  You guys are officially online now.  Everything here is fine.  

I will likely have a roommate in the next couple of weeks.  A friend of mine 
who also works at Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland.  This will 
work out great and also help me with the mortgage payments.  

Take care and talk to you later.

Gerald
