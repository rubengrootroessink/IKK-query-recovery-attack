Mark,  As far as I know, this hasn't been delivered to TW yet.  If you could 
print this on paper with an Enron Logo only.   I already have the ECS header 
on the document.  Steve Harris would be the right party.

Gerald,
Do you know if this document has been delivered to TW?
My guess is that it has not.  I will review, print, sign and have
Melissa deliver to TW unless I hear differently from you.

Who should this be delivered to at TW?
Steve Harris?

Attached is a letter to TW notifying them of the CDEC rate increase and 
requesting their election on the pricing adjustment.  Please review.  We need 
to get this to TW asap.
