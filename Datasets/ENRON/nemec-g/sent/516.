Hi Wayne,  Thanks for the email.  Things are going fine here in Houston.  
Unfortunately this weekend is going to be a bad one for me.  I have to work 
Friday and have plans already for Saturday.  Some other time would probably 
work better.  Let me know what your schedule looks like and we can work 
something out.  Hope things are going well for you in Austin.  Drop me a line 
when you get a chance.

Gerald
