Mark,  I talked with Jeff Stone this morning concerning the petition.  The 
petition did not get filed on Friday as planned.  Jeff had left for 
Tallahassee prior to the FEDEX arriving on Friday morning.  They also wanted 
to have Katz-Kutter (our counsel in Fla.) sign the transmittal letter for the 
petition prior to sending.  This way the petition is sent by the customer and 
not the utility.  Bill Bryant at Katz-Kutter was unavailable Fri.  Jeff 
assured me that they will get this filed today.  I asked him to call me once 
filed.

We need to start thinking about the best way to approach WFEC after this 
petition is filed.  It sounds like Alabama Electric Cooperative is the way to 
approach this.  Do we know someone in our power trading group who works with 
AEC?   Might be useful to approach it through that relationship.
