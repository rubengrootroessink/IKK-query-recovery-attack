Dave,  Per Barry's request, attached is our firm GTC and confirm for gas 
purchase/sale.  The GTC is typically only for deal which are 6 months or 
less.  Credit also need to review the counterparty.  Depending on the 
circumstances, a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement may need to be put into 
place.  Let me know if you would like a copy of the master.
