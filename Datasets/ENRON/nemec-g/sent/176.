Dear Gerald,

In response to the recent business reorganization, we are working to=20
streamline Enron=01,s Global Internet addressing structure.  As a result, t=
he=20
messaging group has been working to ensure a timely conversion from our=20
current addressing scheme of "@ect.enron.com" and "@enron.co.uk" to a unifi=
ed=20
"@enron.com" address. =20

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate addresses across Enron's Global Messaging Enterprise. Some of you=
=20
may find that your original  Internet "short name" was changed as a result =
of=20
your short name being the same as someone else's at Enron.   In addition to=
=20
changing to a standard "@enron.com" we have made a global change to allow=
=20
users to receive email  by short name and long name (see below).

This consolidation will become effective for all former ECT users, beginnin=
g=20
Monday, September 6, 1999. =20

 Internet short name:  gnemec@enron.com

 Internet long name:  Gerald.Nemec@enron.com

Please note middle initials may be used to uniquely identify individuals wi=
th=20
the same name and differentiate them as unique, all names do not have middl=
e=20
initials.
i.e. John.A.Doe@enron.com

Your old "@ect.enron.com" and "@enron.co.uk" addresses will continue to be=
=20
supported until November 1st.
When ordering your new business cards, we are recommending that users begin=
=20
printing their long name address instead of short names.
In order to minimize the impact on your business please begin advising your=
=20
outside contacts of your new address and effective date of Monday, Septembe=
r=20
6th as soon as possible.
If you have additional questions regarding your new address, please contact=
=20
your local help desk.

Thank You for your support in this global messaging endeavor.
