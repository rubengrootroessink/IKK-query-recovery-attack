Ryan,  If you keep sending emails to her every 30 minutes, she will 
eventually respond.  I am on to your twisted little games.

Eric,

Kristi needs your email address.  I don't know if you wanted to give here
your home or work so I'll leave it up to you to do (see note below).

Gerald,

I guess it looks like Kristi likes me best, but we knew that now didn't we.

Hi Ryan,

I'm at DEMA right now setting up all of this year's dive trips!  I got a
message from my office mates saying they had to box me up and move me to a
temporary office in the Woodlands.  We have to make room for the HR people,
but there isn't any room for us downtown yet.

The three of you guys can just show up at the HammerHeads meeting.  There
should be a reserved section somewhere.  We normally have a few beers and
talk about dive stuff.  There will probably be lots of pictures from the
small group trip to Belize in October.  Also, Kennie and I will be going over
this year's events and trips.

Can you forward Eric's email to me?  Whatever I have written down is
incorrect.

See you soon,
Kristi
