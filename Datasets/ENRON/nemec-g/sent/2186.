Andrew,  Attached is the CSA.  I added some language in the HP-hour Charge 
section concerning the minimums.  I wasn't able to download the spreadsheet 
into the doc.  I think it needs to be formatted into word and my assistant is 
not here today.  We can just print out the excel file and attach for now.  
Let me know if you have any questions.
