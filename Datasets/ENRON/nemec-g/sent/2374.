Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter 
amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those 
obligations and liabilities.

I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side 
agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to 
our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the 
pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward 
immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that 
Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.
