G,

I am coming into town tonight. Do you have big plans? I thought we could
hook up for some beers or something and I could crash at your casa.

I need help putting some furniture into  a U Haul tomorrow at Heather's
house in Spring so maybe you could help me and I will by you lunch. I
understand if you are busy. Ernie lives in Tomball. Maybe we can get a hold
of him too.

Let me know dude.

GT
