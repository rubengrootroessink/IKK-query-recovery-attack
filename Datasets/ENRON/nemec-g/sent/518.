>
> Gentlemen:
> Normally I am against chain letters but this is in a good cause.....
>
> This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to tired and
> discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost
> anything.
> Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally
> tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send
> her to the man whose name appears at the top of the list, and add your
> name to the bottom of the list.   When your turn comes, you will receive
> 15,625 women.
> One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the
> writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, 4
> of whom were worth keeping. REMEMBER this chain brings luck. One man's pit
> bull died, and the next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model.
> An unmarried Jewish man living with his widowed mother was able to choose
> between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood supermodel.  You can be lucky
> too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN! One man broke the chain, and got his own
> wife back again.
