Subject: ENA Phase V Agreements

Gerald --   To address your concerns raised in the proposed rider to 
Paragraph 11.2, we would suggest the following language be inserted as the 
last paragraph in Article XI:

11. __  Shipper retains its rights to raise objections of undue 
discrimination with regard to rates and/or terms and conditions applicable to 
Phase V service on grounds of undue discrimination; provided however, in the 
event Shipper has such objections, Shipper will provide Transporter with ten 
(10) days written notice prior to filing any such objections with FERC.
