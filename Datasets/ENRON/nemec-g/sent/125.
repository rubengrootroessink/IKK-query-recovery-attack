G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to?

As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing 
real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't 
think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.

I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be 
long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good 
in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty 
good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.  

Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same 
place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State 
game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be 
glad to contribute to the cause.    

Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in.
