I'll be in town.  Let me know the details.  Eric may have trouble.  After the 
stunt he pulled Tuesday, the Warden's angry.

Gerald,

I don't know if Eric has mentioned it to you or not, but I've been tossing
around the idea of having a couple of the boys over on Saturday evening for a
grill/booze binge.  Are you going to the 'Horns game?  Let me know your
availability.

Submergibly yours,
Ryan
