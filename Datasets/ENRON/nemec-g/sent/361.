GT,   That sounds great on the house. What are you remodeling?  The carpet 
and kitchen?  

I have been out chasing some myself.   It is amazing how may screwed women 
there are out there.  Some good looking ones though.

I am out of town the next couple of weekends, but some time after that would 
be good.  Early February around the 12th or any time thereafter.  Sounds like 
you are going to be busy moving in the house during that time also.  Let me 
know.

Hey G,

Good to here from you. I have been busy having the house remodeled. I am
moving in on the 29th. I started school Tuesday. I didn't realize how many
women are in the college mode. My neck hurt boy.

I have been chasing a little tail here and there. Nothing to right home
about.

I am ready to come to Houston. When is a good weekend?

How are you doing? I hope you are getting laid. You deserve it.

Talk to you later
GT
