I had actually called you before I had seen this email.  I wasn't involved in 
the NOx emissions deal.  I don't think legal was involved at all, at least 
from a Compression Services perspective.  Mark Courtney was the deal maker 
for Compression Services and I believe that John Scarborough, an analyst was 
also involved.  

Let me know if you can do lunch tommorrow and I can tell you exactly how 
exciting my weekend was.  See ya.

Hi.  How was your weekend?  Did anything wild happen while I was away?  On 
another note....are you familiar with a NOx emissions deal between 
Compression Services and our emissions trading desk that was originated last 
year?  I need to talk with those who were involved so I'm nailing everybody.  
Let me know. thanks
