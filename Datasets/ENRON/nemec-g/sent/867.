GT,  How is it going?  Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took 
from OU.  Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.  

I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.  I might have my brother 
and another friend with me.  How are you set for space.  Those guys could 
crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.  If it is a problem, 
just let me know and we can make other arrangements.  

Talk at ya later
