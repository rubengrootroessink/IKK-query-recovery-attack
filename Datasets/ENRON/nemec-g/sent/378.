Has-Been College Football Dynasties.  Hmmm, lets see.  Who else would fit 
into that category?

I hope you guys caught the OU/Texas game on Big Monday last night - the
Sooners handed Texas their worst loss of the year.  In keeping with that
theme:

This is the transcript of a recent episode of Jeopardy!

COMMENTATOR: Welcome to Longhorn Jeopardy! And the host of Longhorn
Jeopardy, here's Alex Trebek.

(Applause).

ALEX: Thank you. And let's welcome our contestants, Connie, Tom and Gary.
You all know how the game's played.
So let's take a look at our Longhorn Jeopardy categories: Egyptian Art,
Has-Been College Football Dynasties, U.S. Foreign Policy, Famous Con Men,
Greek Mythology, Hilarious Sports Excuses, Recruiting Experts, and Diet
Fads.
Connie, you're our defending champion, so you control the board.

CONNIE: Alex, Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $200.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program hasn't won a national
championship in 30 years, and hasn't had a top 10 finish in 17 years, but
their fans think they're on par with Florida State and Penn State...Connie.

CONNIE: What is Oklahoma?

ALEX: No. Tom?

TOM: What is Texas?

ALEX: Correct. The Longhorns' last national title in the final AP poll was
in 1969, and last top 10 finish was in 1983. Tom, you control the board.

TOM: Let's stay with Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $600.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program bills itself as a national title
contender for the 2000 season, yet is coming off a three-game losing streak
and hasn't scored an offensive touchdown in its last 10 quarters...Gary.

GARY: What is Texas?

ALEX: Yes, Texas. I could see all of you buzzed in very quickly, but Gary
barely got in there first. Remember, the Longhorns offense didn't score a
touchdown in the last half of the A&M game, and all of the Nebraska and
Arkansas debacles. Gary, you control.

GARY: Alex, let's try Famous Con Men for $800.

ALEX: The answer is...This American made outlandish promises to his blind
followers, selling them a bill of goods and leading them to believe
prosperity
was around the corner...Gary?

GARY: Who was David Koresh?

ALEX: No...Connie?

CONNIE: Who was Jim Jones?

ALEX: No.

(Long pause). BOOP-BOOP!

ALEX: The answer is, Who was Mack Brown? Mack Brown, the Texas football
coach. I can tell the way you're hitting your hand on your head and nodding,
that's something you should have known. Just remember, contestants, it's
good advice to go with your first instinct. Gary, you still control.

GARY: Alex, Recruiting Experts for $400.

ALEX: The answer is...His football recruiting lists always excite fans in
the Hill Country, but the majority fail to live up to the hype...Gary?

GARY: Who is the Amazing Kreskin?

ALEX: No. Connie?

CONNIE: Who is Bobby Burton?

ALEX: Yes. Bobby Burton, the man who never met a UT commitment he couldn't
over-hype. Connie, you control.
CONNIE: Hilarious Sports Excuses for $600.

(WOO-WOO!)

ALEX: The Daily Double! Connie, you have $400. How much will you wager?

CONNIE: I'll risk all of it, Alex.

ALEX: All of it, OK. The answer is...Mack Brown blamed this on a College
Station hotel for UT's loss to Texas A&M.

CONNIE: What is no strawberry cream cheese for the breakfast bagels,
and...(dramatic pause) lukewarm orange juice?

ALEX: Correct! Both were blamed for the Longhorns' 20-16 loss. We'll be back
to meet the contestants right after this.
