Dick Danes met some time ago with Exxon field personnel concerning this 
well.  They have now indicated that they have a good well and would like to 
be in service by August 15.  I have spoken with the Exxon commercial contact, 
Bill Nicus, and he indicated that they would like to site the meter station 
at the commonpoint and lay a 4" to HPL.  Dick is picking up a plat @Robstown 
office today that reflects where Exxon would like to tie into HPL.  Can we 
let Exxon install meter to our specs and pipeline and let us operate but they 
own?  We can tap our line and install riser for line to tie in.  I can get 
thruput commitment to pay out our investment in tap/riser.  I would prefer to 
let them bear costs and ownership with HPL doing measurement.   We will 
retain ownership of the tap/riser.  

Steve Vanhooser is out but has assigned this project to Gerald Nemec.  By 
this memo I am requesting from Gerald a draft facility agreement and a 
amendment to the Interruptible Transportation Contract which is attached to 
the project agreement.
