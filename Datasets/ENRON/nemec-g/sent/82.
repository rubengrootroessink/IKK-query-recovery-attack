A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And
when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back
that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,
because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the
same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as slowest brain
cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but
naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way,
regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cell making the
brain a faster and more efficient machine.

And that's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.
