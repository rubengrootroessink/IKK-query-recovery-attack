Thanks for the note.  I am also glad we got to know each other this year.  We 
will have to make time to hang out next year, now that your LSAT is over.

Have fun in Denver and be careful of who you hang out with up there. 

Merry Christmas,
Gerald

Hi.  I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas and tell you that I'm really 
glad we got to know each other this year and could hang out over the summer.  
I know it's been a difficult year for you, but 2001 is in reach and I'm 
absolutely positive there are happy times and much fullfilment ahead of you.  
Enjoy the holidays, and I'll see you next year! 

xx
