That sounds fine.  

I haven't recieved any further mail for you from Shell.  I think you said 
there should be more coming.

Hi - Would you like to have dinner next week?  Maybe Thursday?  It's Chris' 
spring break and I told her I'd help her start packing since she moves out at 
the end of the month.  She'll be leaving Thursday afternoon to go to work so 
I won't be needing to help her Thursday night.  Just let me know if you are 
interested.

Lisa
