I would structure the agreement as an absolute obligation by ENA to pay the 
full amount, as that is what they have committed.  Our arrangement with Tejas 
is outside this agreement and should be handled separately.  Make that change 
and let's execute.  Call Janet Wallis to determine the ENA person to execute.

Please review the enclosed document.  I find it satisfactory, especially in 
light that it allows that "up to $44,780" will be reimbursed by ENA to HPL, 
since we're still awaiting word from Tejas as to whether or not they will 
participate.

If this looks fine to you, please advise and I will have two originals 
presented to you for your execution.  Who would you think would be the 
appropriate executor for ENA?

Thanks!

I will get something to you within the next couple of days.  Should be a 
straightforward letter agreement.  

Eric,  Let's discuss in the morning.

Please advise as to the status of the agreement I requested you draft for 
me.  Specifically, I seek a reimbursement agreement with HPL as payee and ENA 
as payor whereby HPL will be kept whole on its costs to install the Lockhart 
meter for Southern Union.  We are currently awaiting the final word from El 
Paso to determine if they elect to participate in this meter as is allowed 
them under the JV Agreement., so the reimbursement amount will either be 
HPL's full share of $44,000 or half of that amount, as you know from the 
Lockhart Agreement in which you participated.

Please let me know where you are on this.

Thanks, Gerald!

Candy
