FYI  Attached are the FERC materials we discussed earlier concerning third 
party ownership of compression in interstate pipes.

I will continue to research and see what might work.

Here are two FERC cases for your ECS files.  The certificates for Cotton 
Valley Compression are on tomorrow's FERC agenda.  The forthcoming orders may 
be relevant to future ECS projects.  With respect to Transwestern, the 
attached orders make it clear that the FERC knows how to order what it views 
as a jurisdictional entity to show cause regarding its status and, ultimately 
to file for a certificate.  This is consistent with our view  of the 
Transwestern order. - Randy
