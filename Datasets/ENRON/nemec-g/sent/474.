Susan, Attached is a description of the Gallup Facilities which should be 
attached as Exhibit A to the Gallup O&M Agreement.  This was prepared from 
information forwarded by Enron Engineering & Construction Company.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks very much for your help and short turnaround on the amendments Friday.
