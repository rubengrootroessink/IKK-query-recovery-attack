You are so cool.  I can't believe that the person in that picture with the 
biggest rock band of all time, was in my bed last night.  Wow!  Everyday I 
found something out that just makes me want you more and more!  Ha Ha Ha

How is Ms. Barbara doing today?  I am weary from the pile of other people's 
projects couched on top of my head but "I will survive, Hey Hey".  I've lost 
the edge Maverick,  I am holding on too tight!
