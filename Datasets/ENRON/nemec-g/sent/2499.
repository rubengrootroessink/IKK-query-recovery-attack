Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used 
for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement 
with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The 
rate sheet they provided would be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review.  I 
am ok to forward this to Power Engineers for their review.
