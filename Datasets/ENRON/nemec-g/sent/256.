Where were you guys?  I really need help.  In fact I need it so badly that I 
waited at Kenneally's until 2:00 am.

I think we need to do an intervention w/ Gerald; he went to Sam's Boat Last
night w/ his brother.  Well we need to at least get our SCUBA stuff out of his
car before he sells it for cocktail money.

OUT!
