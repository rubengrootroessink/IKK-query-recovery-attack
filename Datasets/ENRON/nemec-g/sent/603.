Lori,  Thanks for the diskettes.  The one disk did have the final version of 
the Agreements.  The other disk had earlier versions of the docs.   I will 
use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements.  
Should have drafts for BR's review later this week.  Do you want these 
diskettes returned?  

I talked to Shonnie about any amendments to the LLC and Capacity Allocation 
Agreements, and she wasn't aware of any.  I don't think those 2 agreements 
were revised unless you have other information.  Let me know.

Thanks, 
Gerald

Gerald:

I checked my computer and couldn't find any evidence of the files on my hard
drive; however, I did find two diskettes that, at first glance, appear to
contain the same documents, some of which look like they might be the
finals.  If you'll email your street address back to my assistant, April
Williams, at awilliams@br-inc.com, we can have the diskettes sent to you via
courier.  You can take a look at them and see if in fact they are identical
and have the information you need on them.  If you find them to be exactly
alike, just send one back to me for safekeeping here.

Thanks!
Lori
