Attached for your review are a draft of the gas Confirmation and associated 
GTC.  Also attached is a clean and redlined version of the Agency and 
Management Agreement.  A few minor tweaks were made.  We also added some 
information requirements concerning your gas supply deals.  Please review.  
Thanks for your help.
