Barry,  Attached is a draft of the confirm for the Sierra Deal.  This confirm 
reflect only the volumes related to Package Two.  The confirm for package one 
would be indentical to this one with term and volumes revised.  As we 
discussed this confirm, does not reflect the revisions needed to the existing 
master.  Please review and let's discuss.
