>>Yahoo! News
>>Aggies are  getting themselves into trouble again....
>>
>>  AP. A Texas A&M University student who claimed he had
>>been raped by a
>>dog
>>  was yesterday jailed for 12 months. Martin Hoyle, 20,
>>was arrested by
>>police
>>  after the
>>  passengers of a passing car witnessed a Bull Terrier,
>>called Badger,
>>having
>>  sex with Hoyle on the side of Highway 290, just north
>>of Hempstead.
>>  Assistent District attorney Ben Crossland said the
>>passengers of the
>>car, an
>>  unidentified couple from Houston, had stopped to help
>>because they
>>thought
>>  Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.  But when
>>they got closer they
>>saw
>>  that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down
>>on all fours, and
>>the
>>  dog was straddling him from behind.
>>
>>  "The defendant mumbled something about the dog having
>>taken a liking
>>to
>>  him," said Mr Crossland.  "The couple were extremely
>>offended and
>>sickened
>>  by what they saw." Another individual in a passing
>>car contacted
>>police on a
>>  cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked
>>with the dog on the
>>  feeder road. Hoyle, of College Station, told police
>>"I can't help it
>>if the
>>  dog took a liking to me.  He tried to rape me." He
>>repeated the rape
>>  allegation at the police station and added, "The dog
>>pulled my jeans
>>down."
>>
>>  Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on
>>alcohol-related charges,
>>was
>>  jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an
>>act that outraged
>>  public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory
>>of the incident
>>because
>>  of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful
>>and incredibly
>>  embarrassed. Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum
>>told Hoyle "Never
>>before
>>  in my time at the bar or on the bench have I ever had
>>to deal with
>>somebody
>>  who voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a
>>dog on the public
>>  highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our
>>comprehension. It is an
>>absolutely
>>  disgusting thing for members of the public to have to
>>witness."
