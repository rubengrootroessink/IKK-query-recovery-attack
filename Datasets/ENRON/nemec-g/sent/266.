I feel your pain brother.  I only about halfway through Section 1.   I 
haven't picked up the book in a while.  I will have to catch up on Sunday 
because I will be in Austin on Saturday watching the Horns crushed the angry 
red menace.  

Is there a cliff notes version of this book??

G,

What page are you on--and don't lie.  I thought this class was going be like
"just show up" and you pass--All this bookwork is BS!  All I need is a knife,
C4, waterproof fuse, and a wetsuit, baby.
