It would probably be easiest for me to mail them to you.  What is your 
address?

You are so sweet!  Only a truly nice person would subject themselves to
someone else's corporate Christmas party.  I promise to lose a few pounds
before then, so I can squeeze into this sexy little dress that I bought for
my Tahoe trip, so you won't be too embarassed to be seen with me.  David
has pre-approved it.  The party is at the Four Seasons Hotel on Lamar.

As for the UT tickets, the only night I'm in town before Friday is Wed
night.  Are you around that night?

Hey,

Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I
need to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you
are in town this week.

The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.
