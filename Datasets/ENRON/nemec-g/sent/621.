Got my car back.  $700 to fix.  Ouch!  I am really just glad it wasn't 
worse.  When I stopped my car it was really smoking and I was afraid I had 
burned my moter up.  Eric was providing my transportation during the absence 
of the car.  What a great guy.  Yes, we should try to hook up this weekend.  
The only thing I have going right now is a party that one of the attorneys in 
my group is throwing Saturday night.  Hopefully I will be able to get out of 
there fairly early.  Let's talk before the weekend to try and work something 
out.   I am interested in discussing the Anne situation with you also.  Talk 
to you later.

Your weekend sounds like a nightmare.  I guess now you have a great excuse to 
buy a new car.  What did the garage say about the problem(s)?  

My weekend was pretty fun.  I went to a happy hour Friday night with the 
power trading folks -- now that I'm gone, they're all friendly and talk to 
me.  My cleaning lady came on Saturday so I met two friends for brunch at 
Guggenheim's and we were their from 11:00 to 3:30!  Totally killed the day, 
but it was nice and relaxing.  I did manage to run some errands (something 
productive).  Anne (tall blonde that was at the happy hour) and I went to 
Liberty Noodles for dinner and then hit the downtown bar scene -- totally 
boring.  (Anne is single these days if you want me to hook you up).  Sunday, 
more brunching and then Anne and I went to see Mission Impossible 2...Tom 
Cruise is still totally hot and i didn't mind watching him for two hours.  
That was it.  Not very exciting.  

We should try and do something this weekend.  I have another happy hour 
Friday night but other than that no plans.  This week is pretty busy.  I'm 
starting to panic.  Gotta run.

By the way....how are you getting around these days?

How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although 
enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't 
able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when 
I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and 
everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see 
the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie 
Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had 
cancelled.  Great.  Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.  Cool.   
Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that 
my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.  I had to have the 
car towed back into downtown.  Anyway, it was an interesting trip.
