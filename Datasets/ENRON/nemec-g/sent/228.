Congratulations!!  

On behalf of all of the Asset Group I would like to extend our appreciation 
and congratulations for making Hanover Measurement Services (HMS) a reality.  
A year of creative effort and determination, has transformed the project from 
the sale/leaseback of HPL's metering equipment into a viable measurement 
services company.    HMS provides the opportunity to reduce HPL's operating 
costs and leverage Enron's technical expertise to provide measurement 
services to third party customers.   

This project is an example of how the Asset Group must leverage our resources 
and existing assets to create sustainable, recurring earnings in the years 
ahead.  Each of you contributed to this success and your efforts are greatly 
appreciated by HPL and senior Enron management.  Our task now is to expand  
HMS' customer base and position the company to take advantage of emerging 
measurement, communications and systems technology.

Again, congratulations on establishing and financing HMS, and please share 
our appreciation with team members who assisted you in this success.

Regards,
Brian
