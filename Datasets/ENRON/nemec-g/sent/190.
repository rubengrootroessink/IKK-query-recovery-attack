Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined version of the purchase and gathering 
agreement.  There is no language in these agreement about a right to match 
outside of the Reserve Committment Area.  I haven't had a chance to bounce a 
separate agreement off of Shonnie yet, but will let you know.  Call me if you 
have any questions.
