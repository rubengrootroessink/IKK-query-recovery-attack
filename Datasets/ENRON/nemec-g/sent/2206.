Hi Dena,  Hope you had a good weekend.  I went to Austin for my friends 
wedding.  Got to see a lot of old friends that I haven't seen in a while, so 
that was cool.  Sounds like your pretty busy these days.  I can understand 
that with the transition moving forward.  Lunch would be great.  I am open 
later this week or early next week.  Let me know what you schedule looks 
like.  

Gerald
