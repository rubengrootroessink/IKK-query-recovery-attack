Shonnie, I have extracted all the reps from the PSA which refer to the 
Gathering Companies and attached.  To summarize they are as follows:

1.  Compliance with Laws: Permits (In compliance with all Legal Requirements)
2.  Condition of Property
3.  Litigation
4.  Taxes
5.  Environmental Compliance. (In compliance with all Environmental Laws)

Let me know if we need to review these with Lost Creek and Fort Union counsel.
