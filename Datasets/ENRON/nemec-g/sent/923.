According to the latest changes, below is an example of how the Long & Short 
Prod. Description will appear on the website (for this specific example we 
will need to have the complete name of the Delivery Location "BGE" and have 
it on the Long Desc.)
Please let us know if it is Ok. or if you have any changes/comments
Thanks
Carlos
