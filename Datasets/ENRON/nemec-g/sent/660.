Heidi,  Attached is the modified confirm form.  Please note the following:

1.  This will only work with an Interruptible all points master contract
2.  This confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement.  We need to 
make sure that the master is still in its term.
3.  The counter -party should sign off for every transaction.  Via fax 
signature is acceptable.
4.  A single form per contract must be used.
5.  This form is set up for 1 month or less deals.

We need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global 
contract # for the master contract.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
