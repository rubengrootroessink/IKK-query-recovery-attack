Hi Dee,

I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with 
you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer 
for yall.

I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we 
closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become 
somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward 
those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo.

Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They 
won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I 
wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as 
much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they 
can lowball you on the cash.

Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take 
care and talk to you later.

Hi Gerald,

I am still here!  Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.....  My brother's 
baby passed away from SID's the week I got back from Cabo and so we have been 
dealing with the funeral and all of the emotions that go with losing 
someone.  I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby.... So 
needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so very 
much behind!

Good news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week!  
That way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep 
forgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to you 
by Tues.

How is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your 
social life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!!   
I am sure that one day you will balance everything out...

Well it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also 
Friday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in a 
couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...

Have a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!

Take Care,

Dee

Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from
you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down
to Cabo for good.
