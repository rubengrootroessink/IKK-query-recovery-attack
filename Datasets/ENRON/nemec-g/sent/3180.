Hello,  I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp.  I have recently been 
asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.  Monica Jordan previously 
had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority 
Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.  

I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it 
operates, when it meets. etc.  Any information you could supply would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Gerald Nemec
