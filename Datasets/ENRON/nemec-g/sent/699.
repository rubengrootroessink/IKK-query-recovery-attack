My thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out 
if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent 
Agreement.  Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue 
up.

gerald,what do you think "reasonable efforts to acquire" means?  do we have 
to elect to take transport....at what price........since producer must pay 
the price under the contract price formula....we may need to be willing to 
agree on a range of acceptable prices...........this would also help define 
reasonale efforts...........................your thoughts please   bng
