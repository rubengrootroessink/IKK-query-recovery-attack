Sounds good.  Pencil me in.  Of course this won't be as nice as going fishing 
to catch those small fish.

		 Subject: Interested in Golf?


We're putting together a golf tournament for Friday morning, August 18 at
Estes Park Golf Club.  I've already talked to the pro and I told him I could
give him a head count within the next few days.  For now, he's got us
penciled in for about 10 tee times beginning at 8:32 a.m.  (I'll be playing
in that first foursome since it's most important that I get to the church
before any of you knuckleheads).  The cost will be $44.00 (green fee and 1/2
cart).  Please let me know as soon as possible, via return email, whether
you want to play.
