Hi Melissa,  What up? Just stuck here working late on a project and thought I 
would drop you a line to see if you were still alive.  Hope you had a great 
Christmas and New Years and were able to enjoy some time off.  I spent most 
of it up here working.  The workload has been incredible.  

Take care,
Gerald
