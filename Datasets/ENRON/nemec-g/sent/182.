From the Oklahoma 100:

                                  

                 "Waylon Turdsby, star TE from the reigning 3-A champion 
Chickasha
                 Fighting Chick-Peas gave the Sooners a verbal commitment by 
letter
                 late Wednesday according to OK100 sources. This is a big 
boost to
                 the Sooners who were competing with Tulsa, Anadarko Junior 
College
                 and out of state powerhouse Kansas for his services. Waylon, 
who is
                 6'2", 218lbs and runs a 4.75 40 chose OU because "They serve 
fried
                 pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet 
hairdos".
                 Waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the 
family
                 used car dealership. Waylon added "My daddy says he has done 
a lot
                 of business with Sooner coaches and boosters over the years 
and that
                 OU would be the best place to refine my used car selling 
skills." The
                 great traditions of OU were also a factor according to 
Waylon, "They
                 have this great tradition where they touch all the movie 
posters of OU
                 legend Brian Bosworth before running out onto the field. You 
just don't
                 get that kind of inspiration outside of OU."
