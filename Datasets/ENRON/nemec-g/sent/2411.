Tyrell,  I am assuming that Cannon has not signed the amendment to the letter 
agreement yet and we can just modify that letter.  Let me know and I will 
modify the amendment letter to reflect the new payment date.

Yes, we can make that payment for any date.  Let's raise a letter amending 
the payment from 30 days to whatever date he wants.
