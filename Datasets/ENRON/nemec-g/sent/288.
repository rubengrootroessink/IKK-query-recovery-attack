Neta,   I understand you currently have an agreement in place with Jomax 
Construction.  Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C. wants to do an affiliate work 
order under the existing agreement.  Can you email the details on the 
agreement and forward a copy of the agreement.  I will use the form of 
Affiliate Work Order you forwarded prior.  Thanks for your help.
