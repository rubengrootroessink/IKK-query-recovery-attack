Let me address your topics one by one:

 1. That is fine, except that no guaranties regarding the condition of your 
entertainment center can be made for the duration of your stay.  What day are 
you planning on moving?
 2.  I have only received one piece of mail within the last week, so I think 
it is mostly working.
 3.  Eric's local  - Egillaspie@coral-energy.com  (713) 230-3576
 4.  No calls
 5.  Sounds good.  Sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up, we both have 
been running somewhere when we ran into each other at the house.  Sat. nite I 
think the Gillaspie's wanted to go to Sambuca's downtown.  Thought I might 
join them.  Might want to check with Eric to see what's up.  

Peace,  G$

Gerald,

The dust is finally starting to settle here at work and at Laura's, allow
me to address a couple of topics:

     1)  I plan to be fully moved out this weekend except that I'd like to
leave me entertainment rack in your garage for a week or two while I try to
sell it if that's OK with you.
     2)  I put in a forward for my mail but is doesn't seem to be in
effect.  I called in a complaint yesterday but until then you may continue
to receive some.  I'll just have to check every couple of days.
     3)  I still haven't caught up with Eric at all, do you have his new
work number and email?
     4)  I don't know if you're getting any calls for me but in case you
don't have it, my new number at Laura's is 527-9460.
     5)  Lastly, we need to knock back some tonsil paint this weekend
sometime.  That will give me a chance to turn my key back over to you as
well and you can go back to walking around the house naked.

That's about it.  Talk to ya later,
Ryan
