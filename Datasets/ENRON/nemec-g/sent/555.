Are you moving floors or just moving around on 31?  I don't want a lump of 
coal from you at Christmas.

Well, it looks like I'm headed over to the coal group.  They called me up 
after lunch and it's all just a matter of time.  (I actually think the coal 
group cares more about emissions than power, so this might be better after 
all).  Anyway, it appears pretty close to being a done deal.  Barring any 
unforseen glitches, I should be up there in the next week or so.  

Have fun in Mexico!
