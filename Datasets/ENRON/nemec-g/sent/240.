 I called the travel agent . . . left a message for some goon
there to call me back.  As soon as he calls me back I will put down a
deposit for myself & Gerald (my new roommate) . . . tell me something
about this guy: J Arthur said he met him previously and was cool with
him.  'Sup?

 Hot Shirley Slack has had a death in the family and is out now
on an "extended" leave of absence.  FYI.
