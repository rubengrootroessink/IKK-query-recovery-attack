Sounds good.  I let Eric know.  He's not sure if he will make it, but oh 
well, I gave him the invite.  

Are you still cranking away at work?  Kicking butt and taking names.

Just to let you know...

The Happy Hour has been changed to Little Woodrows.  They think it might
rain.  Just wanted to let you know so that you could tell Eric.  Wouldn't
want them to be hanging out at the West Alabama Ice House and we never show
up!
