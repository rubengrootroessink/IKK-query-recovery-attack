That's a good one.  This is taking on much more meaning now that she possibly 
might be a US Senator.  Yikes.

               OVER THE HILLARY
                            * * *
submitted by The Captain

Hillary Clinton and her driver were cruising along a country road one
evening
when a cow ran in front of the car.

The driver tried to avoid it but couldn't - the cow was killed.

Hillary told her driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners
what happened.

About an hour later, the driver staggered back to the car with his clothes
in
disarray.  He was holding a bottle of wine in one hand, a cigar in the other

and smiling happily.

"What happened?" asked Hillary.

"Well," the driver replied, "the farmer gave me the wine, his wife gave me
the
cigar, and their beautiful daughter made mad passionate love to me."

"My God, what did you tell them?" asked Hillary.

The driver replied: "I'm Hillary Clinton's driver, and I just killed the
cow."
