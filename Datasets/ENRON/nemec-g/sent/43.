Paul,  I am still here.  Where the heck are you?  I guess you are back in the 
States by now.  What are you guy's up to?  How many kids do you have now?

As for Lisa and I, we are still DINKs (Double Income No Kids) in Houston.  I 
am officially an attorney now working in the corporate legal department of 
Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  I had to turn in my pocket protector when I 
left my engineering job.  Lisa actually just joined Enron, so now it is all 
in the family.  We are  doing good.  We bought a 50 yr old house near 
downtown about 1 year ago and have been restoring it ever since.  It really 
is amazing how all that Bob Villa watching is now paying dividends.  I am 
considering getting a tool belt with my name engraved on it.  We are both 
doing good.  Life for me is good, now that I don't have to go to school in 
the evening or study for the bar exam.  I am just enjoying my free time now.

I still keep up with George and Ernie occasionally.  George still lives in 
Austin and is single.  I visit him a couple of times a year.  You wouldn't 
believe it.  He still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in 
college.  Kind of like stepping into a time warp.  Ernie just finished 
getting his MBA at UT this spring.  He will be working in San Antonio for 
Frito Lay (no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it).  He 
now has a little girl with another kid on the way.  I think due sometime this 
summer.  He has really changed since undergrad.  A responsible young man now.

How are Mom and Pop Bieraugel doing? (Is the Big 10 going to take it in the 
shorts this year?)  Are they still in the Washington area?  Lisa had talked 
to your mom about a year ago when she was trying to track you down for my 
graduation party.  Sounded like all was well in the Bieraugel household.  I 
think she said John was in Alaska?

Anyway, drop me a note when you get a chance.  It is really great to hear 
from you again.  We need to keep in touch.

Gerald,
