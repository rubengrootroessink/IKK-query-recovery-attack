hi, gerald.

thank you for making comments on the proposed open access regulations that 
the mexican ferc has published.  peggy banczak will be faxing me a copy 
tomorrow.  i will be in the office on friday and would love to have the 
opportunity to talk with you about some of the more egregious concepts they 
have presented.  how does your calendar look?  please let me know if i can 
have 1/2 hour of your time.

thanks,

jamie ginsberg
