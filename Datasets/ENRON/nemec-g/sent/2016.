Attached for your review are drafts of the Capacity Assignment and Release 
Agreement and the Transaction No. 1 attached to the Master Firm Purchase Sale 
Enfolio.  

Peter,  any input you would have on Article 3 of the Assignment Agreement 
would be greatly appreciated.  Stephanie is trying to get these out as soon 
as possible tomorrow.
