Darren,  Since the Master is an old vintage, we are amending to reflect the 
current version and specifically any credit revisions that are necessary.  
The old master was only set up for 6 month or less term deals with volumes of 
15,000 MMBtu or less.

Gerald,
Russell informed me that we are amending the current Master Physical that we 
have with them. Since I am just being informed of any changes, I would like 
to know the purpose for the ammendment.

Darren,   Please prepare a credit ticket for Sierra Pacific Power Company.  
Per Russell Diamonds request, I am forwarding this to your attention. Let me 
know if you need anything else.
