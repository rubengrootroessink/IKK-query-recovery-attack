Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know 
if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this 
issue:

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.
