Hi Katie,

Phone numbers are:

(713) 942-8066 Home
(281) 772-9250 Cell Phone

Hope everything goes well with the move and UofH.  San Francisco is an 
awesome town.  Make sure you take some warm clothes as it does get chilly 
there year round.  I would live there in a heartbeat if it didn't cost a 
small fortune to do so.  I especially love going up to Napa.  Napa is so 
beautiful and relaxing and the free wine tastings make for a good time also.  

Have fun and talk to you later
Gerald

I'll be on this e-mail until Sat. morning.  That is when I am moving
back home.  The number there is 281-391-5524.  I won't get e-mail hooked
up there for a few weeks.  My # in the fall will be 979-847-0011 I
believe.  I've got to check on that one.

You are going to kill me, but I need your phone # again.  It's a long
story, but when my e-mail was full and I was going through deleting
stuff, I think I accidentally deleted your #.  Can I please have it
again?

Katie
