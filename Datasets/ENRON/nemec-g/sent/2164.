Ernie,  How is it going?  Did you have a good weekend?  I actually had to 
work for part of it, so my weekend wasn't all that great.

Were you able to book a room for me?  Wanted to be sure that was taken care 
of.

Mary,

Can I book one more room at this rate on this reservation (same card number),
for a total of two rooms?  The second will be a non-smaking king size as well.

Thank you,
Ernie
