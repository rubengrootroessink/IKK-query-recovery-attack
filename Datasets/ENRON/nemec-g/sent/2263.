1.  Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with 
producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.  Producers were required 
to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will 
assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit 
on the capacity.  Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA 
capacity stake on this expansion.  The basis is currently very profitable 
between Wyoming and California.  Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt

2.  Enron Compression Services - StageCoach  - Negotiating a deal to provide 
HP Compression Services to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in Pennsylvania.  
Drafts have been sent to Tennessee.  Also negotiating a power and gas deal 
with EES to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to 
EES which ECS receives from Tennessee.
