RFP,   I had a good time also.  The bands were interesting though.  I bet 
that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance.  

The date was actually  her call.  We are meeting some of her friends out for 
dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.  Seriously, this girl is 
cool and a lot of fun.  Should be a good time.  Of course I am assuming that 
the date is still on.  In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz 
(a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.   I really have no idea what I said 
to her.  She may not be speaking to me anymore.

What was with Willis last night?  No show!

Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston.

Gerry,

Thanks for coming out last night--funny how that sentence could be miss
interpreted.  Seriously though, folks, it was pretty fun even though the
bands were less that par.  We need to do more hanging out, especially now
that Eric won't let us have sex with his wife.  I'm looking forward to some
jams and a trip back down to the Gulf this weekend.  Good luck on the
date--what's the plans?
