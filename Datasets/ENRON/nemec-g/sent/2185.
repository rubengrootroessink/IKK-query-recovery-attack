That's fine.  Actually I really need to catch up on my sleep and my Napster 
downloading.  Have fun with your friends and I'll chill out at my crib.  
Yes,  my face has taken a beating in recent months.  Tell Casey I will live.

Hey there!

I just got a call from some friends that I have not seen in a while and they
wanted to meet for dinner.  However, it won't be until 8:00 or after.
So...would you be upset if I changed my plans for tonight (actually, the
plans are not 100%, however, I did not want to call you at the last minute).
Hopefully you will see this as an opportunity for you to get some sleep.  If
all works out, I should be home by about 10 and if you are interested in
coming over then...you are more than welcome to!  Or..we can let the
excitement of seeing each other build up and let you have sweet dreams about
the leather Rockies.  Just kidding.  Anyway, let me know your thoughts.

Also, Casey came by my office today and expressed her apologies about burning
your face and wanted me to tell you how sorry she was.  I told her that the
skin should grow back in a few weeks.
