D-Rock,  Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.  I have 
noted a couple of areas where I still have questions.

One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny 
us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.  We need to discuss this 
one tommorrow.  I will shout out at ya tommorrow.
