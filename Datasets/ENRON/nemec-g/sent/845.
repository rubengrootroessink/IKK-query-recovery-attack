I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our 
request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their 
obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period 
prior to the effect date of the agreement.  

Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your 
discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his 
notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.  

Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.

Did you see this Gerald.  They have taken out one of our compressors.  Should 
I call Kent Harris?

at San Arroyo....its ugly.

Also, I told Ken to (remember to) add you as his primary contact.

Gentlemen,

Please see the attached production report - note the comment under
"DOWNTIME" at the end of the report.  It indicates Wildhorse pulled out a
compressor last week at the San Arroyo Plant and our pressures have
increased.   We are trying to get more information and will pass it along
when we get it.

Ken Krisa

Attached is the production report.
We are still having high line pressures.
I will call you after I speak with Wildhorse this morning.
