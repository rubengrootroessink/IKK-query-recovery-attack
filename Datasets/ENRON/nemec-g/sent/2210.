How is your day going?  Generally manageable around here.  One of the 
assistants found out I used to be an Iron Maiden fan (technically, I still 
am)  and brought me an old Iron Maiden poster.  Boy is that going to look 
good in the house.  I know this is really impressing you.    

Talk at ya later,
