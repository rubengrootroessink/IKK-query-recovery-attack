Well 35 of 40 spots are confirmed for the party!

I was up all night on it and now working.....yikes!

Does your brother want to come? Or someone else you know?

Sat Oct 21 7-11 pm

It would be great if he did, I have the perfect role!

I'll need his mailing address and e-mail......

Thanks, Later buddy
