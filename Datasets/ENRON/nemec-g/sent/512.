Sounds like you are running and gunning.  I know how those times feel.  Seems 
like it is never going to end.   You have been through it enough times to 
know that it always does.  I don't think there is any feeling like turning in 
that last paper or walking out of that last final at the end of a semester.  
Feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  After that comes 
lifting the huge mug filled with beer.

Hang in there.
Gerald

Hey Gerald,
 Sorry I've taken a while to write back.  I've been really busy with my
research paper.  It's due on Tues. along with another paper.  I also
have a presentation on Thurs. and one on next Tues.  After that it's
take home final time and then I am done.  I can see the light at the end
of the road!  It feels like a long way until I get there though.
 So, you are learning guitar?  THat's pretty cool.  I used to play the
trumpet.  I miss it every once in a while.
 Well, I hope you have a good week.
Talk to you later,
Katie
