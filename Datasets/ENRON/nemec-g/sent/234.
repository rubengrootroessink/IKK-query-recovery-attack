Subject: NTSB Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged a highly secret
plan they had funded with the U.S. auto makers for the past five-years. The
NTSB covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing
black boxes in four wheel drive pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in
fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.

They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of
drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, "Oh, Sh*t!" Only the state of Texas 
was
different, where 89.3% of the final words were, "Hey Y'all, watch this!"
