Rude Dog,

Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the 
edge.

Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about 
Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the 
starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some 
pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we 
don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game.  
But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.

The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me 
comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. 
are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we 
come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending 
Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the 
fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good 
one.  

Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian 
women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.

Well, only 4 more days to go until kickoff.  What do you think about the 
game?  I saw that we are 9.5 point favorites.  I personally would love to win 
by that much.  NCSt.'s passing attack really scares me.  I guess I still 
don't have a lot of confidence in our CBs yet.  I think that Jammer and 
Jackson(from what I have read) are solid in the middle and our front 4 is 
just plain stout.  We have alot of depth at LB as well, so I guess we will 
need to get maximum pressure on  Barnette to help out JW, EH, AB, & RB.  
Offensively, from what I have been reading, it sounds like Applewhite has 
been very sharp and our RBs aren't going to be as weak as I first thought.  
Also, I understand the OL is coming along quite well.  

So, do we win?  How do you see the game unfolding?  I won't get it out here, 
but I will try to listen to it on the internet.  I can't wait to get back and 
watch these games!

Talk to me Goose.

Bruce
