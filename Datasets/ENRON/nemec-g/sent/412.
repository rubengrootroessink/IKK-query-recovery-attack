Gerald,

Please review the attached list below for an existing MSA contract.  Also, 
please establish an MSA contract with each contractor that does not already 
have one.  The list below does contain a contact number and name as well as 
the company's full name and address.

Thanks for your assistance!

Jeff Gilliam
