Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder 
River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I 
added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized 
at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the 
units contracted for during the initial 2 year period.
