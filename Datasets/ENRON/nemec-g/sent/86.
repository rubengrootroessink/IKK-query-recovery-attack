What's up rude-dog.  Haven't heard any new recruiting news.  I think it is 
going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.  

I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.  She said 
you have been exploring the Australian countryside.  Bet there is some 
amazing stuff down under.  Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its 
going.

I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?  We need 
to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.
