Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals 
docs, per your voicemail.

Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you 
earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now 
having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well. 

 Let me know if you need anything else.
