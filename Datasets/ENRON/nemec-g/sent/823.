No need to worry.  I won't send that picture to anyone.  Now the one with 
Eric and the smoke hanging out of his mouth will be distributed to ALL ENRON 
EMPLOYEES.

I probably don't need to mention this to you, but I'm trusting that you won't 
send "shot" picture to ANYONE.  I thought you might get a chuckle out of it, 
and it was fun that night, but I would die if some of the more straight-laced 
people around here caught a glimpse of it!
