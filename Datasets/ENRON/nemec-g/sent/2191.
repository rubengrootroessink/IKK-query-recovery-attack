David,  Could you please review the following agreement.  Specifically 
Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.  ReUse will be providing ash handling 
services under this agreement.  This same agreement will be used for both  
Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.  These are the power 
plants in the Alamac transaction.  We are looking at replacing the existing 
Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Mr. Nemec:

Attached is the draft proposed Ash Removal Agreement for Elizabethown.  The
insurance language has not yet been reviewed by my client's insurance
specialist, so that section may be subject to revision.

I am preparing the Coal Hauling contract now, and will forward it soon.
