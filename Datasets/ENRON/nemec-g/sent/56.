Elizabeth,  The Duns number for Enron Compression Services Company is 
072773547.   I will be completing the Agency Agreement this afternoon and 
will forward to you.  Also I faxed the corporate data sheet for the company 
to you yesterday.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks for your 
help.
