No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are 
still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described 
my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me 
(Antibiotics or similar).  

Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good 
opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a 
better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.  

I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know.

Gerald - I am sorry that I didn't call this weekend.  I know we have a lot to 
talk about, but I have been sick all weekend and honestly couldn't face the 
stuff we have to face on top of it all.  I am still feeling ill, but was 
going crazy at home.  I don't know what I have, but I hope you don't get it.  
I decided to take the methanol job and stay in Global Markets, so my days are 
going to be decidedly busier.  Maybe we can get together for lunch later in 
the week to discuss how to move forward.

I am sorry to do this over email, but as always it is difficult to talk at my 
desk.  Let me know what your schedule looks like this week and we'll work 
something out.

Miss you,
Lisa
