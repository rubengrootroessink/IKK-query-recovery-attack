Brian,  Do you know how quick D&B would have data entered into this system?  
We need to move this as fast as possible.

One of the contract administrators in my group was not able to find the DUNS 
number you provided in the D&B database online.  I am not sure how quickly 
updates are made to their database.  Are you aware when this number was 
issued?  I will put in a request to inquire again at the beginning of next 
week.  If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to give me 
a call.  Thanks.

Elizabeth,  The Duns number for Enron Compression Services Company is 
072773547.   I will be completing the Agency Agreement this afternoon and 
will forward to you.  Also I faxed the corporate data sheet for the company 
to you yesterday.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks for your 
help.
