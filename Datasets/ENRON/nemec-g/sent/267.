Attached are clean and redline versions of my revisions to the 
Confidentiality Agreement.

Please Note:

1.  I am not sure is the paragraph concerning US Technical Data is 
necessary.   If it is, what are we receiving and what type of obligations 
would we have?

2.  Need to get as specific as possible concerning the project in the first 
paragraph.

I will be in a due diligence this afternoon and most of tommorrow.  I will be 
checking voice mail.
