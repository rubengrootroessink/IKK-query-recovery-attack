Robin,  Attached is the revised letter.  I added that Enron North America 
Corp.  was performing these efforts.  (If an entity other than ENA has the 
contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the 
proper entity.  I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from 
Citgo.  Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and 
since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to 
demand cover.  I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy 
to Gordonsville.  I am going to be leaving, but you can call my cell phone if 
you have any questions.  (281) 772-9250.
