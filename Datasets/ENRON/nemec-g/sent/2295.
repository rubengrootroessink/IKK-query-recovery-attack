Thanks for the review.  A more formal response is not necessary at this 
time.

Gerry, I've looked over the agreement and still don't believe that it raises 
any PUC regulatory issues.  If you need more (or a more formal version of 
this e-mail) please contact me.

Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed
as this is no longer part of the deal.
