Here are the changes to the Enfolio that Michael and I came up with.  Please
review and let me know if you have any comments.
I spoke with Michael and the document that Reed of PGT mentioned was with
Michael is actually the surety bond that Michael has sent to the insurance
company for final execution.  If you have any credit questions, please call
Michael at 650-303-0274 (cell).
