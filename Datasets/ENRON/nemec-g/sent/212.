That is unbelievable.  Make you really stop and think and put things in 
perspective.

I am planning on coming in for the game.  Probably Friday night since the 
game is earlier than last time.  Let me know what you schedule looks like.  
Later.

Gerald,

I just wanted to say Hi and let you know about Clifton. Did you know him at
all? He has had cancer and has only a couple days to live. Can you believe
it?

I can't. Are you coming into town this weekend? Let me know.

GT
