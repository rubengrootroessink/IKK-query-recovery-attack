So in other words, a typical night in the Gillaspie household, except for the 
sex.

Dis is fargon war!!  I take it the SCUBA crack was intended for me, since I
seem
to be the only non-gunner in the group.  I'll tell you what I did last night;
 I
ate a whole pizza by myself, drank 5  40's of OE, had 17 camels, and then had
sex with my wife!!

There seems to be some confusion as to the status Kristi's star
self-contained-underwater-breathing-apparatus student (aka as SCUBA for some
of you who haven't opened the book).  So listen here:  last night I swam
8x800's at Balley's (all of which was done under water while holding my
breath) and then I practiced my float for 2.5 hours during which I quized
myself using flash cards which I had made while memorizing the text earlier
in the day.

Tonight I plan to hit Galveston bay for an open water-simulation swim and I
also intend to travel to SeaWorld in San Antonio this weekend to sneak into
their killer whale tank.

Oh, and did I mention the bitchin' new speedo I purchased?
