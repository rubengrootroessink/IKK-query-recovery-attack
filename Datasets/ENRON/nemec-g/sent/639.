I talked to Susan last Friday and she gave me her changes which I put into 
the doc.  So I am only waiting on Foti and Dushinske's changes.

Attached is the Vector term sheet.

gerald,

i have a couple of questions for you:

1)  susan scott told me that she would get back to you with some of the nits 
that she had on the hubbard document.  i am waiting for the final comments 
from dushinske, but they should come today.  i would like to get everything 
signed today because we want to make sure that we can book the gas at these 
high prices.

2)  vector term sheet.  i seem to have deleted my copy of the most recent 
draft we had circulating.  can you send me your most recent update, please?

if i hear anything from dushinske, i will let you know,

thanks,

jamie
