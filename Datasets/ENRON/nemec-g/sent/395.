Upon reading the e:mail message shown below, I immediatedly went to 
Start/Programs/Infobasis and I found no WINFASTER application.  The 
applications that were available were Croporate Workbook 3.0c & 4.1, 
Disclosure, Enron Corporate Datasheets, Gas and Power Daily Web Page and 
Phone Book.

Given that I requested and Joya Davis processed the request for the FASTR 
Database for me, Gerald Nemec and Shonnie Daniel in early January, it is 
really a shame that so many people's time has been wasted with this matter.  

Please figure out why the program is not showing up on my computer.  Is it 
showing up on Gerald's and Shonnie's?

Hello Felix,

Just following up regarding FASTR ,    I spoke with Kevin Hopper and he said 
that the WINFASTR is the application he is looking for.
it is under Start / Programs / Infobasis.   He is in the group.




Thanks !
