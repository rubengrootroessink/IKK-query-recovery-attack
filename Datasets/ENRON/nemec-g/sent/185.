The operations information you requested should now be directed to Robert 
Morgan in Facility Planning.  I forwarded the sheets you left in my office 
last week to Robert for his review.  I handled this request before when I was 
in Facility Planning, but Robert has now taken my place.  Shonnie Daniel will 
work with you from the Legal Group perspective to give you any help you need.
