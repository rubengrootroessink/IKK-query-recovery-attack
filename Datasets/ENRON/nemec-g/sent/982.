We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.

I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have 
been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it 
though.

Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 
am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in 
Mississippi.

I know we talked about it, but did I ever pay you for the UT/A&M tickets
Friday night?  If not, send me your address and I'll drop a check in the
mail to you since I'll be out of town much of the rest of the year.

Speaking of which, have you ever been to Acapulco?  Cyndi and I are going
there for Christmas.  If you've been, let me know if you have any
recommendations for things to do down there.

Thanks again for going the other night.  Hope I didn't make you too
uncomfortable at the end of the evening.  A little too much alcohol there
at the end of the evening.
