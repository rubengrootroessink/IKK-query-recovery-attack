Dan:

Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet? It would be
impossible. Anyway, here's a quick update from the battlefield. In regards
to flight plans, we had a minor setback today. We called our local Wuxi
travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix. I asked her

if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports. After
much heated debate she said no. However, we then called Shanghai Pudong
Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry. They demanded
that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports.
Therefore, I'll need for you to provide me with the full names (first,
middle, last) for everybody in your group. We'll then pass these on to the
Wuxi agent who has already lined up the Shanghai>Qingdao flight. We'll also
provide the full names to agents who'll be setting up the other flights.

Secondly, let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey.

After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing.

We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao, Zang Bao Guo, to line us
up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote. Jeff felt that the

$525/person fee was too much; he stated that he had retirement savings to
consider (ha!). We've spent the last couple days in negotiations with
another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the
same Beijing tour package at a more budget-minded price. Today she gave us a

rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package. The
estimated price would be about $520/couple for the same five day package in
Beijing. This is in comparison to your price quite of $525/person for a five

day package. We would downgrade from a 5 star hotel to a 4 star hotel (it's
new). Keep in mind that we're still hammering out the details, but the
alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the
wallet.

The crude itinerary would look something like this:

June 11- fly to Beijing in the morning; check into hotel; tour the Forbidden

City; see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening.

June 12- Great Wall; Ding Temple (tombs); Beijing roast duck dinner.

June 13- Temple of Heaven; Summer Palace; dinner at the Old Beijing Tea
House (singing and other entertainment provided).

June 14- Tiananmen Square; Beihai Park; lunch at Beihai King's Food
Restaurant (this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during

the Qing Dynasty); Yong He Gong (Tibetan temple); free evening.

June 15- Hutong alley tour; lunch at a Xinjiang (Chinese Muslim cuisine)
restaurant; Wangfujing Street (shopping at the trendy stores); Beijing opera

in the evening.

June 16- most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai.

We knocked out some destinations from the original plan. For example, the
dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang (antique shopping). Ai Ping

called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldn't be very
interesting: it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we
see on TV every night. The dance performance didn't include any minority
group dances or "traditional" village styles, so Ai Ping didn't think it
sounded very "Chinese." If the antique shopping is desired (it's an
on-the-street auction, with other stores selling original and
not-so-original "fake" items) we can slap it back on the itinerary. I don't
give a hoot either way. I aim to please and we are extremely flexible. Ai
Ping's hometown is six hours west of Beijing. She's been to Beijing a
billion times; she doesn't care where we go. Let me know what you think and
we'll do as instructed.

Thirdly, I don't think we'll be needing any deposit money. The airplane tix
will be reserved in your names. The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to
have your Shanghai>Qingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that
you could pay there. The Qingdao>Beijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon

arrival. The Beijing agent hasn't mentioned a  deposit for the tour package
yet. If she does, I'll put the money down- no problem.

So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do

the Shanghai tour package: your call. It looks like a good plan to me. If
you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it.
Let me know.

Hope this gives you an idea on where we're at. Please respond asap with
comments/questions. Hope all is swell in Tejas. Will write again soon.

My Regards,

Jon Gillaspie
