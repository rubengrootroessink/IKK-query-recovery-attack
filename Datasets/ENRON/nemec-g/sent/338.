You have probably done this already, but remove any reference to SCADA in the 
Alstom agreement.

The Alstom load is small.  It just peaks real fast and hard.  We don't need 
SCADA here.  With the loss of the Wyman Gordon load, we will be left with 
only the Cypress Fairbanks city gate and Alstom on the 12" (4007) line, so 
line pack will handle whatever instantaneous pull Alstom should develop.
