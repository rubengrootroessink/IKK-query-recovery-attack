		 Subject: Update on Gabrielle Grace


There have been many inquiries about Gabrielle, so I thought I would give 
everybody an update.  Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good.  She has had 
many complications since the surgery (chest fluid, blood clots, infections, 
and fluctuating blood pressure due to high blood acidity).  For the past 24 
hours, she has been relatively stable, but no improvements.  She is still in 
ICU and it could still go either way.  

When Jim's 2 1/2 year old son, Connor, visited Gabrielle on Monday, he looked 
at Jim and said "Gabrielle wants to go home."  Please keep her in your 
prayers.  

Thank you,
Dina
