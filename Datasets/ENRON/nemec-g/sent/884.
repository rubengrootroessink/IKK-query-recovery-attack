No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.  Fastball had the hit about 2 
years ago called The Way.  Toadies; they just rock.  We will probably dress 
as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys.

Sounds fun and musically fulfilling.  What sort of music do these bands 
play?  Is it all acid rock?  Are you and Eric dressing up as members of 
KISS?

Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is 
Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House 
prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice 
House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.

Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called 
Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other 
bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm.

Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are 
about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If 
you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let 
me know.

Hi.  I'm trying to be organized and thought I'd check in to see if you guys 
are around this weekend.  If you want to try and meet out, Anne and I are 
"lookin' for a good time".
