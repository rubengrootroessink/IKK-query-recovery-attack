Hi Mom,   Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I have just been 
pretty busy at work and on the weekends.  Seems like there is not enough 
hours in the day.  I did go down to Cabo for a week.  It was a blast.  We 
partied way too much.  Everything else is going fine.  My roommate moved in 
at the beginning of September.  So far so good.   

Hope everything is going well down in CC.  Love yall and talk to you later.

Gerald

How's it going? Fine I hope we are all o.k. It is finally cooling off a
little. It was awful this past week.
                   I heard you were in Cobo for the weekend. Did you have
fun. Paul called Monday and said you had gone.
                       So how are things going with you. I guess your busy.
What's new going on.
                   Talked to Sharon since they got back from their
honeymoon, they said they had a real good time the weather was wonderful.
                                                   Well all for now talk to
you soon..........Dad and I send our love


MOM
