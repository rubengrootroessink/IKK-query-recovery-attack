Jamie,
Thank you for coming by.  I actually had a conversation with JC this morning 
regarding electrical compression.  I have an idea I am working on and I was 
wondering if I gave you horsepower requirements and assumed  distances from 
high voltage power lines for 4 compression stations along a pipeline.  Would 
it be a big deal for you to get me some estimated rates?
Again,  this is only an idea right now so I don't want you spinning your 
wheels if it takes a lot of work.  But, I thought if you just had a couple of 
spreadsheets that you needed to fill in some blanks on, maybe you could do it?
Also, the total horsepower requirements are on the order of 13,755 hp in 4 
stations.  So if your minimum is 9,000 hp per station we can't hit that, but 
if it is a 9,000 hp min. on a project as a whole then it might amount to 
something.
Thanks,
Gaylen

Shelley,

Thank you for your time last week.  I enjoyed meeting with you and your
colleagues to discuss electric motor compression and its applications for
the Questar system.  As I was walking out of the building, JC and I had a
couple of minutes to chat and he told me that he would give me a call
sometime in the next couple of weeks to discuss some projects that Questar
may be considering in the near future.

I am looking forward to exploring opportunities with you.

If you have any questions, or need any further information from me, please
do not hesitate to call.

Best regards,
