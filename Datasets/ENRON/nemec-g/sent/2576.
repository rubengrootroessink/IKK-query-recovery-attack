OK Kids:

This will be one of your last major briefings before your Mars landing. Good

luck cosmonauts! Remember one thing: the Martians are a little weird from
our standpoint, but essentially they are harmless and good-natured bipeds
like us. Now, let's begin with the pre-landing meeting.


ERIC/DAN'S GROUP:

Shanghai hotel: Jin Chang Hotel.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan).

Heather's single room rate: $27 USD/night.

Tour package price: $34 USD total/person (280 yuan) this price is for June
5-8.

Meals: Meals not included in package. Your group will need to arrange and
pay for your own meals with the assistance of your guide/translator. Your
translator will accompany you to the restaurants if you wish. He/she can
help you order and suggest dishes which represent the local Shanghai
cuisine. Go ahead and pay for your guide's meal if you choose to bring them
along for dinner (it won't be very expensive). This option will give you
more freedom.

Admission tickets: Also not included in the tour package. You'll need to pay

for admission to the Yu Yuan Gardens, Yu Fo Si (Buddhist Temple), Shanghai
Art Museum, etc.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at Pudong Airport in

Shanghai. Ai Ping and I will accompany them and meet you. They'll also take
you and the rest of the group to the airport on June 8th for your flight to
Qingdao.

We got a special hotel rate for the group through one of Ai Ping's friends,
Lucy Hong. Her company, Rosemont Corp. (Dallas, TX), has a special
arrangement with the hotel. When you check in you should tell the clerks
that you're checkin in under the Rosemont Corp's name so as to receive the
special discount. Don't worry- we'll be there to assist you when you check
in.


MOM/DAD'S GROUP:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan), same as above.

Tour package price: $24 USD total/person, reduced price because one day less

in Shanghai.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at the airport and
take you to the airport for your Qingdao flight on June 8th.]

Note: you also need to check-in under the Rosemont Corp. name.


JEFF/CATHY:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: same as above.

No tour package.

Airport service: none. You'll need to take a taxi into Shanghai from Pudong
Airport. You could also take a bus, but I'm not sure which of the 4-5 buses
you would need to take. Jeff, I'll have Ai Ping try and send you the Hotel
name and address in Chinese so you can just show it to the taxi driver. I'm
not sure whether or not your computer will accept Chinese script, but we'll
give it a try. The Jin Chang Hotel is relatively new, so most of the taxi
drivers don't know where it is without a little assistance. Not to worry,
we'll figure something out to make sure you don't end up in Chengdu after
your trans-Pacific hop.

You'll join the rest of the group the following morning on the hotel bus to
the airport for your Qingdao flight.


THE FOLLOWING ARE THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS FOR THE VARIOUS HOTELS YOU'LL
BE STAYING IN:

SHANGHAI: Jin Chang Hotel
Telephone: 021-6298 8899

QINGDAO: Donghai Hotel
Telephone: 053-2388 7070

BEIJING: Beijing International Hotel
Telephone: 010-6512 6688

When you call these numbers you should say in perfect Mandarin, "Qian tai."
This means "front desk." Then start blabbing in your most unintelligible
English. The hotel staff will then understand that they've got a foreign
devil on the line making trouble, and they'll find someone who can speak
Chinglish with you.

Ai Ping and Jon Gillaspie's mobile phone number: 013033511842.
We got Ai Ping's cell phone hooked up again specifically to assist all
parties in their entrance to the middle kingdom. Do not hesitate to call us
any any time of the day if you need help. I'm serious!

Ai Ping's beeper number: 1922202866. You can use this number also.


BEIJING TOUR PACKAGE DETAILS:

Hotel name: Beijing International Hotel, 5 star hotel.

Hotel price: $70 USD/night (570 yuan).

Total package price: $550 USD/couple total.
This price does not include beverages (ie. in restaurants we buy the booze).

We'll also need to pay for the roast Beijing duck dinner, and the Xinjiang
restaurant dinner (Chinese Muslim cuisine).

Tour package itinerary: same as before with some minor changes; will inform
group of changes tomorrow.

That's all for now folks. I'm spent, and can no longer look at a computer
monitor without becoming cross-eyed. More info will be sent tomorrow. Any
questions: you know who to contact. Zaijian comrades, may the proletarian
revolution continue!

The East is Red,

Jon Gillaspie
