Gerald,

Please use hbinder instead of hbender in any e-mails you send to me.  
Concerning the PPA, I did receive it but there was a line missing in the 
middle of each page--looks like a copier problem.

Henry Binder

Subject:  Gallup Docs.

Attached for your review in the Gallup Transaction are the following 
documents:

     1.  Assignment and Contribution Agreement - Assignment operational
documents and rights in assets from ECS into the LLC

     2.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement -  Defines
relationship between ECS and Enron Engineering and Construction        Company
for installation of the motor driver at Gallup.  This document will be 
assigned
into the LLC except for that portion which relates to the electric power
transmission line.  The utility will take ownership of the transmission line 
per
the power purchase agreement.

Also forwarded via hard copy yesterday, was the executed Power Purchase
Agreement.  Please let me know if you have not received this yet.

I will shortly email the form of gas purchase agreement between the LLC and 
ECS.
This will merely be a new Confirm (Transaction Agreement "C") which will 
operate
under the existing Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS and the
LLC which was created for Kachina.

Construction1.doc)
