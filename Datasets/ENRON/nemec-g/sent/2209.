Nick,  Attached is the form of services agreement.  The form is a little 
different than Steve Van Hooser's original form.  This a form that we used in 
Wyoming which I modified to fit this context.  I will prepare the tasking 
letter based on your scope of work and forward shortly.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.
