Attached is a draft for your review.  Please review and lets discuss any 
comments.

  After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the 
amendments should work in their present form.  The 2,500 Western gas needs to 
be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.   Exception should 
read "Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area 
shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the 
agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.  Any 
decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 
2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production 
levels."



I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
