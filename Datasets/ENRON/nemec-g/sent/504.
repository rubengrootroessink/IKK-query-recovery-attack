What's going on Tree?  Bruce forwarded me your email address, probably 
against your wishes.  Just thought I'd drop a line and see if your up for 
beers sometime this weekend.  I know its tough to fit anytime in between 
those dates with the lovely fake breasted super models, but let's try and 
hook up sometime.
