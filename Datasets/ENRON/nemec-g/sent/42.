Subject: Project Rock: Service Agreements

Attached are the following documents for initial review.  The services 
agreement (rockmsa-mastermac.) is between HPLC and Meter Aquisition, and the 
services agreement (rockmsa-stone.) is between Meter Aquisition and Hanover 
Measurement Services Company (our Stone entity).   



Also attached is a revised distribution list.  Please call Pat Radford at 
853-9282 with additional addresses or phone numbers or corrections to the 
list.  

I will be out of the office from June 14 to July 4.  In my absence coordinate 
related matters with Barbara Gray and Lance Schuler.
