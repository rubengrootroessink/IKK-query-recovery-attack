Gerald:

Coleman is ready to sign an LOU and begin the contracting phase; I have had 
numerous discussions with Coleman the past five months and they have seen a 
few versions of the attached term sheet.  I cannot remember if Shonnie has 
reviewed any of the term sheets, so I would appreciate it if you could review 
the latest version of the term sheet and share your suggestions.  (The MDQ 
ratchet in the term sheet is admittedly somewhat confusing...but I'm trying 
to limit the amount of MDQ that ECT holds open for these small companies who 
are just now beginning to drill acreage in undeveloped areas.)  

Thanks.

Dan
