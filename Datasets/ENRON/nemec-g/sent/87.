Things are going good in legal.  I am getting to work on some interesting 
stuff.  I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.  It 
was an asset and finance deal.  I got to work with the finance commercial and 
legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.  It is hard to keep 
up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of 
knowledge at this point.  Tense but fun.  

I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.  I heard Babers and 
Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.  Sounds like they 
were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them 
down.  At least that most other peoples opinion.  Sounds like Kenny Hayter 
look pretty good.  Leading Texas rusher.  He sounds like a power runner not a 
real juker.  

I am really worried about the NC State game.  It would suck to lose the home 
opener, but I think that is a very real possibility.  Their quarterback 
sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA.  I still think 
we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case.  Your right though.   If we 
fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building.  
I just don't think that will happen.  Mack is too smart and can really get 
these kids to overchieve.  I think his players believe and are motivated to 
play hard.  Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like 
James Brown.  When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is 
really going to pay dividends in the long run.  Mack Brown and Greg Davis 
weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC.  But Mackovic 
had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg 
picked right up on.  Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson 
wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone.  I like it.  It is going 
to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting.

I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any 
areas to go.  I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and 
know he is looking work people.  I don't know if this was the same stuff you 
did in Denver or the same group.   Might be.  Those guys do work a lot of 
hours.  Almost as bad as attorneys.  I will give it some thought.

Well, all for now.  Keep in touch.  I am glad you are going to be back in 
Houston.  We will have some fun.  I want to hear all about how much you 
really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.
