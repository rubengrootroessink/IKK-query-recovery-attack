Brad,  Attached is your form of lease with my comments incorporated.  Please 
note that I have added Mariner Energy, Inc. as a Party to the agreement since 
Mariner is performing all operations and maintenance for the facilities owned 
by MEGS.  

Please note the Mariner also will need to review and comment on  this 
document and I am forwarding it to them concurrently.  

Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 with questions.
