Katie,  Glad I cheered you up.  Believe me, I can relate.  I could tell you 
horror stories about when I was studying for the bar exam.  I'll save those 
for some other time.  

Hope all is going well and moving forward.  What always kept me going was the 
idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and I wanted to be 
able to look back and feel that I had given the best effort I could.  That's 
all you can do.  It is typically more than enough to do very well in grades.  
I will quit preaching now and let you get back to work.  

No big plans for the Easter Weekend.  Will be here in Houston.  I actually 
have to work on Friday, but am thinking about taking a vacation day.  Sounds 
like you will probably be busy with school and family over your weekend in 
Katy, but give me a call if you feel like it.  Maybe we can do something fun.
