John,  Attached are the case historys for the two cases.  Note:

Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited
Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only 
(not really relevant)
Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found 
that the facts of the two cases were different.

Hope this helps.
