I'm sorry.  Eric and I aren't speaking at the moment due to creative 
differences.  I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and 
he wants only the brown ones removed.

The word on the street is that the Gillaspie Drum Fund is being converted
into the Gillaspie Home Improvement Fund.  THIS IS SERIOUS.  We all need to
do our part in brainwashing Eric into the "band is bigger than the house"
mentality.  Please do your part.

Thanks,
Ryan Ruppert
Rhythm Guitarist
The Band With No Name
