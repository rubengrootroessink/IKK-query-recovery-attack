Hi.  Will you send me "Movieline Dave's" email address?  I'm trying to put 
together a happy hour for next week and I want to include him so he and Lara 
can meet.  (Although I don't think the two of them are really going to dig 
each other very much).  Oh well, it's a good excuse to drink.  

thanks.
