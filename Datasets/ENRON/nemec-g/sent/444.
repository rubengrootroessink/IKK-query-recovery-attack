Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.  I 
would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation. 

Note:  We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement 
in place for assignment to the LLC.  ECS retains payment obligation under the 
construction agreement even after assignment into the LLC.  Thanks for your 
help.
