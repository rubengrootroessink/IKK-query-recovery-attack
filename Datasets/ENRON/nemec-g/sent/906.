A few interesting deals.  Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet 
trading site.  "www.enrononline.com"  The site was actually developed out of 
our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace.  
Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of 
projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days.  

Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of 
your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again.  

I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state 
was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive 
me for my mental lapses.

OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type 
substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not 
sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.

Take care,  
Gerald.

Dear Gerald,

I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to
sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good
to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had
a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an
unusual occurrence for me.
This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that
Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has
been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she
seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a
cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I
think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard
this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet.
Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and
yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should
have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy
(although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you
think? Hmm.
Anyway, better get on with some work,
have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals?
Sophie.
