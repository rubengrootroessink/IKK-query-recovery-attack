Gerald,

Could you please send or email me copies of:
  (i) the Guaranty, dated as of 12/17/98 by Enron Corp. in favor of Lost 
Creek, and
  (ii) the Guaranty, dated as of 12/17/98 by BR in favor of Lost Creek
so that I can prepare the Guaranty Terminations to be executed in connection 
with the conversion.  Thanks.

Please call me at (713) 220-4427 if you have any questions.

Sean
