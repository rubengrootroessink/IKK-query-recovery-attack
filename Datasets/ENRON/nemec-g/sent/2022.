Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Assignment and 
Release doc. for Calpine.  The redline has Calpine changes in light purple 
with Enron's changes is red.  Please review.

Stephanie, I did not resend the revised confirm which I sent earlier today.  
There were no changes to that doc. since the revised version I sent this 
morning.
