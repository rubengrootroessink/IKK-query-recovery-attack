Dutch,  Attached is a draft GTC for the storage product we discussed.  Please 
review.  There are a few areas in the doc. which I have highlighted for 
question.  The business terms probably need to be flushed out a little more.  
I would be happy to discuss this with the appropriate individuals at your 
convenience.  Sorry for the delay.
