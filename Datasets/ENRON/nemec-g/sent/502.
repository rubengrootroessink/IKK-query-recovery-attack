Hi Katie,
 That email was pretty true.  School can be extremely stressful in short 
periods (around finals) but overall compared to work it was really a pretty 
easy lifestyle.  How are thing's going for you with school?  Sounded like 
this month was going to be a busy one.  The good thing about school is that 
there is a definite ending point with a break between.  
 It has calmed down some around here.  Focusing on things that I had dropped 
during the end of quarter stretch.  I bought a new guitar yesterday.  My 
friend Eric and I had our eye on this black Fernandes model for some time and 
yesterday we decided to go for it.  I am still in the learning stages of 
playing but it won't be too long before fame and stardom are at my disposal.  
Well maybe a little longer than that.  Playing is really fun and a good 
stress reliever though. 

Hope everthing is going well for you. 

Take care,  
Gerald
