Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my 
revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded 
earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal 
Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.
