Jessica,  Attached are the Agreement for both Suzanne and Diane.  The form 
also refers to a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement that both 
Suzanne and Diane must execute.  I have a call in to Michelle about those 
forms.  I will forward as soon as I get them.  We can go ahead though and 
forward these agreements to MTM.
