I actually knew all of that information!  I was just checking your story to 
make sure it was consistent with what you told me that night.  Everything 
seems to be in order.  Good!

Okay, brief resume of my life to date if you like:

Born, grew up, (in England), am currently studying at Nottingham University
(E. Midlands of England) although that's not strictly true as I'm here in
Texas studying at UT Law School as part of an exchange scheme. I go back in
June or whenever and finish my degree so will finally graduate in June 2002.
(Fingers crossed). Other than that I don't do much else but eat, drink and
be merry. Actually I play the viola (and sing a bit) and that took over my
life back home but here I'm doing more of the drinking part of things - more
wine than beer though it has to be said - also better for you - well,
almost!
So there you go - does that bring back any memories?!
Hope you're having a fun week, happy halloween for yesterday - though I'm
not sure how fanatical people are about it in Houston - they certainly seem
to go all out for making a big deal of it here!
Sophie.
