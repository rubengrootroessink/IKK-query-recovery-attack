Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to 
match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we 
discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We 
can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review 
and lets discuss.
