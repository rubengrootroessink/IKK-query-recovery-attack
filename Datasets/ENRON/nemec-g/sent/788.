Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back 
without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality 
baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me. 

What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did 
your partners meet any new family members?

I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much 
more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when you 
get a chance and let me know how you are.

Take care,
Gerald.
