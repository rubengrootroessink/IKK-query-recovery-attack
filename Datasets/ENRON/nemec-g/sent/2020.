Brant,  The following are my responses;

1.  We don't have a problem removing fax notice as long as they are willing 
to leave the required termination notice at 5 days.  Since we can't fax 
notice, we will have to mail such notice which will take several days.

2.  We can remove affiliate assignment.  

Sorry about the delay.

Gerald,

Here is their response to our comments.  Not much but take a look:

Under term7:  Notices - unless we include language similiar to...'Fax is 
acceptable as long as the fax is followed by hardcopy documentation and 
effective upon such hardcopy reciept.'  Back to square one.  They don't like 
fax.
Under term 8:  they are objecting to affiliate assignment.  Successor is ok.  
Affiliate assignment is no good.  They would like to take out the term 
assigns.

that is it.
