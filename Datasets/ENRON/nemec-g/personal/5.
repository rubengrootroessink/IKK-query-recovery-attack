Hi Gerald,

I am still here!  Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.....  My brother's 
baby passed away from SID's the week I got back from Cabo and so we have been 
dealing with the funeral and all of the emotions that go with losing 
someone.  I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby.... So 
needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so very 
much behind!

Good news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week!  
That way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep 
forgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to you 
by Tues.

How is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your 
social life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!!   
I am sure that one day you will balance everything out...

Well it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also 
Friday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in a 
couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...

Have a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!

Take Care,

Dee

Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from
you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down
to Cabo for good.
