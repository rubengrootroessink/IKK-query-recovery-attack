So I'm here in my office compiling some production data off the shared
drive this morning and listening to a little of the Best of the D cd that
Eric was so kind to cut for me.  Of course due to the unruly nature of the
D I was using my headphones.  About 2 hours later I get a phone call and I
take off my headphones to answer it only to find that my computer speakers
were blasting the D and I couldn't tell because of the headphones.  Maybe
I'll be employing the message of the D sooner than I'd like.

Ps.  Welcome back.
