Have you heard anything about this one?  Amanda works in Heather's group, so I would expect her to contact some on the Origination side.

Do you know which attorney is working on this - it seems to be priority for this week?

Kortney-

Rhonda told me to contact you.  She submitted a request for a credit worksheet and draft EEI for New Smyrna Beach Utility.  I need to get back to him this week because I am going down there next week to discuss short and long term power contract opportunities.  If you have a moment, can you please check the status on that report.  I really would appreciate it.

Thank you very much,

Amanda Day
