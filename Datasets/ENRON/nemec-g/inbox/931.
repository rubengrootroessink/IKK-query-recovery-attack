I left you a voice mail earlier indicating I wanted to send you the attached
agreement.  The first one of these we did a long time ago was only a page
and a half.  Now we are up to 3 and a half.  Must be we have more to
protect.  Anyway, please review and if OK, make and sign two copies for our
execution.  This will help us get the right information to you.  Also
consider when it might be good to meet to discuss the project.
