Hi everybody,
 
Well, somethings didn't turn out as quite as  planned.  In case you didn't hear, our first offer on our house fell  through.  Fortunately, we already have another offer and the new closing  date is November 26.  All indications are that this one will go through so  here's the timeline...  We're leaving Houston on December 3.  We'll be  in our new house in Florida sometime between Dec 7 - 15th.  That gives us  just enough time to get settled in before the new semester starts on  January 7.
 
We've set up a hotmail account so we don't miss any  emails until our new Florida DSL account is ready to go.  You can start  using it immediately: scubadoobydoo_FL@hotmail.com     (Our panacea account will be valid through the end of  November.)  You can always use our website to get the active email  address.  Go to www.scubadoobydoo.com  and click on  "Contact Us".
 
We'll give everybody our change of address info as  soon as both home sales are officially done.  
 
Have a great Thanksgiving!
Kristi and Greg  Foster
