To all,
 
Unfortunately I will only be available in pockets of time today.  I am catching a flight back to Buffalo through Philly at 11:33 pm (ET).  I will be landing in Houston at 4:51 pm.  I would recommend that following steps be done in order to close the transaction today.
 
1.  Lisa, Please get Rick Buy's signature for the DASH  -- assuming that Reliant is the counterparty.
 
2.  Eva or Lisa - Please leave a draft version of the DASH with Tammi Schoppe, Louise Kitchen's assistant. (You might want to tentatively set up an appointment on her calendar.)
 
3. Gerald - Please check with Reliant's legal , Steve Williams (?), as well as Ken Bradlee and have them send back final  email versions of all appropriate documents.
 
4. When we have received the appropriate email from Reliant - get on Louise's calendar and have Gerald prepare executables.
 
5. When the DASH and the Board Resolution document have been signed by Louise and all other relevant individuals listed, send the executables to Reliant.
 
6. Please have Reliant wire the money after signing the contracts and get a confirmation number.
 
7. Upon receiving a confirmation number related to the wire transfer, please have Julie sign the returned executables from Reliant.
 
Then, have a glass of wine on me!  I will be calling during the day.  My cell is 713-302-4187.
 
Regards, Jean
