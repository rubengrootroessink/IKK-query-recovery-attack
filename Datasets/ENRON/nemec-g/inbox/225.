Gerald,

Our landlord here in Denver (Equity Office) is requesting a formal notice of "Enron North America, Corp."'s name change from "Enron Capital and Trade Resources".  Apparently, on our lease, it says "Enron Capital and Trade Resources", but in the 3rd Amendment, it reads "Enron North America, Corp".  Equity says they need a copy of what was sent in for the official name change.  I'm not sure if you have something we can give them???  Please let me know.

I appreciate your help,
Thank you,

Heidi DuBose
Enron North America
