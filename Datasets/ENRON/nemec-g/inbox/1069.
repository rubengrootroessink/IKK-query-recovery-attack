Hello All,

With my last day at Enron quickly approaching, I thought it would be a good idea to set everyone up with my new address and phone in Ann Arbor.  Here you go.

110 Depot Street
Ann Arbor, MI  48104

(H): 734-214-3815

My future email address will be:

brudy@umich.edu

This won't be active until September 5 though, so you can reach me between now and then at my internet email:

bruce_rudy@lycos.com

Hope all is well with everyone.

Take Care,

Bruce
