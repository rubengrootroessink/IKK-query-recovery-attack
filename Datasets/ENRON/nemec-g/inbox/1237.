 Dear Debra,

I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for lunch. I
feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was interviewing
for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town on Thursday
of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me know. I want
you to fill me in on how you have been.

Your law clerk,

Majed Nachawati
