Shane,
The redletter changes to sections 5 & 7 will have to be approved by the
legal department which will further delay the execution. Please let me know
whether you want to proceed with the changes.

Thanks,
Karen

     Karen:

    I have made our changes in red.   I have corrected our Duns number and
contact info.
   I am assuming that you will fill in the exhibits as applicable.

    Call me if you have any questions.
