	Gerald,

	I wanted to get you started on this ASAP as we discussed.  I don't expect a finished product but 
	preferr that you initiate the draft and I'll work with it as necessary in you absence.  Thanks for you
	cooperation.

	I have attached a summary of the Parking Provision and the CSA in addition to the Term Sheet
	that is dated but you get the idea.
