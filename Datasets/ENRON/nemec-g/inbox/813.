Gerald,

This is a follow-up to my earlier e-mail about the discovery request from John Haswell, 352-376-5226. Perhaps you have already spoken to him.

I'm traveling today and tomorrow. On vacation next week. I am in the office Friday and reachable much of the week (when not on an airplane). Call when you can.

Bill
