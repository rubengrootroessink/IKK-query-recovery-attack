Dear All,

I realize the final decision to move these deals have not been made. Judy Thorne is meeting with Hunter Shively in the morning, we might have some more information then.
Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to get together to discuss what needs to happen if/when the deals are moved before the fact rather then after.

Lets still meet tomorrow, then if nothing else we can come up with a list of contract and operational issues that we can present to the commercial heads....right?

Ellen

Sorry, I'm already booked with Volume Management at that time.  I've spoke with George to get the latest decisions on what's happening to the Appalachian deals.  There seems to be a few open items and the effective date for moving these deals is undetermined.  He feels, we should hold off on having this meeting till the actual effective date has been set?  He should be hearing something in the next week or two.
