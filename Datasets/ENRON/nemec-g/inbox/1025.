Be sure in paragraph 1 to identify how the person signing the affidavit is employed.

In the last paragraph, you state "Enron and El Paso each have a 50% share."  Which Enron are you talking about?  Enron North America Corp. or Enron Corp.  Just be precise.

Other than that it looks good to me, altough I will obviously defer to our Florida counsel re: the specifics needed to satisfy the other side.
