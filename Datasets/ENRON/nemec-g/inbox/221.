I am out on Monday, but can be reached at 713.826.4488 (cell). I thought everything looked good. FYI - Karen cannot find an accrued liability balance at 6/30/01 after all.  I want to make sure that this is a final adjustment, not subject to further audit whereby we would have to give it back. Exposure is the 100k we deducted from the Hanover realted amouints. But I don't want Northern to know - it seems to me they have already accepted it and we used the 100k to feel better about the issue we felt was in our favor contractually anyway.
