Hey Gerald,
Judy just came by and has added a few new contracts to the stack.  She has requested that you review and initial off on them before lunch so she can get the to Jean Mrha and submit them before the end of today (in order to meet the 10/01 deadline).  Let me know if I can do anything to help.
