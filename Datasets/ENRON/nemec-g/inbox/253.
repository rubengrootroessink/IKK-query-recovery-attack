Dear Carolyn:  Would you please be so kind as to see what information we have in our files regarding Enron Gas Processing and HPL, each of whom owned a plant and gathering system, respectively, which were sold to Encinal and Cerritos.  Do we have a copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 2/10/95?  I'm looking for this on behalf of Ann Elizabeth White, who went to AEP with HPL.  

Please advise, and thanks,
Mary
