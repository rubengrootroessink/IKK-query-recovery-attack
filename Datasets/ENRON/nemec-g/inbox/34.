JULIA and MARY, Carol just called to say she's in a meeting that won't be finished until around noon today.  Could one of you please have someone in your group work with Veronica Espinoza on this matter.  Would you please call me to advise me which person is working on handling this request so I may advise Carol; her Blackberry is not working right now.

Thanks,
Sandy Haldeman (Ext. 53879)

Carol,

Attached is the collateral Agreement that Duke Energy Trading & Marketing would like to have executed to cover the physical gas positions.  Please review the agreement and give any one of us a call here in credit if you have any questions.  

The attorney that will be working on the agreement at Duke is Joe Forbes and you can reach him at 713-627-6124.

Thanks,

Veronica
