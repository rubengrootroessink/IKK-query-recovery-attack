Scott,

I talked to Gerald after our telecon as you requested ----- here's the summ=
ary:

I repeated to Gerald my reply when you asked my opinion regarding the best =
way to approach Clark.  To reiterate for clarity, I suggest that Scott tell=
 Clark we are not satisfied with BCCK's management of activities related to=
 field construction and construction management activities.  If you (Scott)=
 feel it is appropriate or necessary to offer details, the general reasons =
are: (1) Poor communication leading to schedule delays and/or cost increase=
s; (2)  A very casual (and consequently unacceptable) approach to improving=
 the overall project schedule as necessary to achieve a 15 December 2001 in=
-service date; and, (3) Unilateral decision-making by BCCK without the cons=
ent of all Crescendo partners having the same effect as (1) above.  As a re=
sult, Scott and Ken mutually agree and have directed Dave to take a lead ro=
le in completing all construction, testing, commissioning, start-up and rel=
ated activities.  It is important to stress to Clark, that, while Dave and =
his delegates have primary authority and responsibility for completing thes=
e activities, it will not be done at the exclusion of BCCK.  To the contrar=
y, Crescendo requests and expects BCCK's full and open participation. =20

Though the contract does not explicitly address this action, Gerald agreed =
that since Enron wears the vast majority of all types of risk in this proje=
ct, it is reasonable for us (Enron) to take action in order to protect our =
interests.  In addition, Ken Krisa agrees with the need and reasons for mak=
ing this move, establishing strong support (though not, perhaps, unanimous)=
 at the Crescendo LLC level.  Because the contract does not provide specifi=
cally for this action, our options -- in increasing order of severity with =
regard to impact upon BCCK and the potential for unpleasant reactions by sa=
me -- are:

Most Productive, Least Destructive to Project and Relationships:

1.  Take the direct approach to Clark as I described above.

Plan B:

2.  Submit a change order under the appropriate section of the Contract cha=
nging BCCK's scope of work and informing them of the change in management p=
hilosophy and leadership.

Desperation Tactic:

3.  Declare the agreement in default due to non-performance and take over a=
ll activities contemplated by the agreement.

(Gerald --- How did I do???)
