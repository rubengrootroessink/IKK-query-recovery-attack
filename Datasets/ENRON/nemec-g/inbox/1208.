Gerald and Roger, please see attached.  The one change that jumps out at me is the period of non-usage from 365 days to two years.  Isn't there an industry standard we should hold to?  I don't know if it's one or two years.  Otherwise, I don't have any issues with their changes, but will yield to your judgement.  
Thanks.
Also, we need to draft an invoice for the R/W.  As calculated by Roger, it is 142.12 Rods.  At $200/rod, they owe us $28,424.  Roger is verifying the $200/rod.

Mr. Johnson,
 
Attached is the revised R/W for your review and approval. What does GNOEC stand for? (page 8, para 1)
 
Thanks,
