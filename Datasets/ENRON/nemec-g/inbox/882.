Gerald!

Oneok is okay with our form of guarantee, they do not want to make any changes to our form.  As a result they requested that we issue said guarantee, the relevant information is listed below.

Have we completed our review of their language?  I hope that we can coordinate the incoming and outgoing for the same time.

Thanks
Rudwell.
