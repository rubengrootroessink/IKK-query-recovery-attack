Jean wrote me a sarcastic/funny email that I'll tell you about.  I do finally have a phone though?

Beer/dinner sounds great for Sunday evening.  Let me know what time you'll be back in town and where you want to meet.

Hey Dude,  Do you have a phone yet?  Jean would have never let that happen.  I am actually going to Austin this weekend.  I should be back Sunday afternoon sometime.  We could grab a beer and some dinner Sunday evening. Let me know.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

JK
