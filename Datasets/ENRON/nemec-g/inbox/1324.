Mr. Nemec,

My name is Sherry Taylor, I am working with one of the largest national law
firms in recruiting an experienced energy associate. This opportunity is
based in the Houston office.  The focus of this opportunity is regulatory
matters, both upstream (FERC and transportation-related matters) and
downstream issues (production-side regulatory matters including exploration
issues and joint operating agreement issues).    I would like to give you
more specifics, I am unsure of the best way to contact you.   If you would
be open to discuss, just let me know the best time and contact number.
Sherry Taylor (817) 578-8633 or sherrytaylor7@earthlink.net.
Thanks,
Sherry
