Hi Pat,

Everything's fine thanks.  I moved into a new house the day of the flood.
I was very nervous, but survived without damage.  Gerald's been in China.
Gerald, are you back in town?  Give me a call.

How are you doing Pat?  What's the story with you and Mark buying a house
together?  Are you insane?

Dave and Gerald,

I just wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give you
any problems?  I hope all is well.



Thanks,
