Keith,

Patrick Johnson has been out on military leave the past 2 weeks.  I imagine he'll be anxious to get this the transaction with Sorrento finalized once he returns.  Gerald Nemec, a colleague in the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department, has agreed to review the draft Right of Way Agreement and call you to discuss the draft Agreement.  Gerald will be handling all legal work involved with EWS's efforts to sell the 400 acre Napoleonville Salt properties.

He should be contacting you later in the week.

Steve
