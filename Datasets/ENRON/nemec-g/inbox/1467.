Since I don't need to be in the loop, can you please let Janie and/or Randy know the volume each month.  You need to check with Gerald to make sure the paperwork has been done - 

Thanks

Stephanie

Importance:	High



I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities. 

Thanks
