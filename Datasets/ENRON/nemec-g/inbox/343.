Gerald,

I wanted to follow up on our on Monday regarding the GTC Point Specific confirmation for Torch Energy. Are you getting close to having something ready for us to send to them? We need to send them something to start reviewing today if at all possible.

If you could let me know as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Judy
