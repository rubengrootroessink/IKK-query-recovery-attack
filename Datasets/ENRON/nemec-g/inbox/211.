The application and draft order were hand delivered to the Louisiana
House and Senate Natural Resources Committee on Sept. 26.  By statute,
the committee has 15 days within which to consider the application and
make comments.  I would expect that the order be returned to DNR on Oct.
12, with the final order coming the following week.
