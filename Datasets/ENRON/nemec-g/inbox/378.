Hi Judy,

I just wanted to let you know that we have a few contracts that are close to completion.  Aquila has been sent for execution and MainLine should be sent over on Monday for us to execute.  Also, BP Energy, Sequent, and Conoco are closed.  If you need anything else let me know.

Thanks,

Alisha
