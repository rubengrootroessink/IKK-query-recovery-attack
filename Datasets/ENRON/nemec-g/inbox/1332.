Subject:	Malin Retructuring with CNR

 Here are the details of the CNR restructuring that is happening effective Dec 1/01.  This should reduce the amount of credit Enron has been asked to post with both PGT-NW and TCPL.

TAGG ET3738 - 15,000  mmbtu at Malin

ENA releases to CNR PGT capacity Kingsgate to Malin 15,000 mmbtu Dec01-Oct02 at full tolls
EC assigns to CNR TCPL-BC capacity ABC to Kingsgate 16,222 GJ Dec01-Oct02
EC assigns to CNR Nova ABC capacity 437.7 e3m3 Dec01-Oct02

EC purch from CNR of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct08: 
Del Pt changes from NIT to Malin
price changes so EC does not collect Nova, TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; EC still pays to CNR 25% of PGE-NW and TCPL-BC tolls
EC does not collect fuel. i.e. Fuel NIT goes to zero

EC sale to ENA of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01- Oct 08:
Del Pt changes from Kingsgate to Malin
price changes so ENA does not collect PGE-NW toll

EC and ENA own renewal rights. CNRL does not.

price changes so EC does not collect TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; still collect Nova toll

EC sale to ENA of 10,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct 03:

Howard Sangwine and Greg Johnson are preparing confirmation amendments that should reflect the above terms.

Any questions give me a call.
