Sorry, I'm already booked with Volume Management at that time.  I've spoke with George to get the latest decisions on what's happening to the Appalachian deals.  There seems to be a few open items and the effective date for moving these deals is undetermined.  He feels, we should hold off on having this meeting till the actual effective date has been set?  He should be hearing something in the next week or two.
