Steve, this was forwarded to me by Robert Rose.  Should we change the name to LRCI, Inc. and go with it?
We'll still need a legal description of the R/W itself.

Patrick,

While reviewing the proposed easement I found myself
making many changes to the easement.  It then occurred
to me that Ann Elizabeth has already prepared a standard
easement for situation where another company wishes
to construct a new pipeline across HPL owned property.

Perhaps you can use this standard easement agreement
(attached hereto) for the situation in Assumption Parish?

Let me know your thoughts on this agreement.  It's terms
and conditions are certainly more favorable to Enron's interests.
