	Enron's 3rd quarter blood drive will be held on Thursday, July 12, 2001, from 7am-4pm.  For your convenience, 
	two mobile coaches from the M. D. Anderson Blood Center will be parked outside the Enron Building on Andrews 
	Street.  Contact the Enron Health Center at Ext. 3-6100 or via email at: mailto:health.center@enron.com to 
	schedule an appointment.  Walk-ins are welcome.  

	Through our partnership with M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Enron employees assist not only the Houston 
	community but also our employees and their families.  Let's continue the spirit of giving.
