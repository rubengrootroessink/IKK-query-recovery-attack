	Brandi:

	Please see the list of requested documents and information
concerning the Louisiana Resources Company pipeline and terminal.  We have
also listed a number of questions concerning separate issues about the
facility and pipeline that we would like to discuss.  Some of the requests
are redundant to our previous discussions.  Thanks.

*	List (and copies) of all applicable state and federal agency permits
for ownership/operations of the pipeline, terminal, and pier/dock facilities
in state waters
*	Copies of all surface use agreements, right-of-ways, easements, and
leases for the combination of facilities and what ongoing costs are
associated with each
*	All other agreements that affect the operations and/or the ownership
of the rights of way and/or surface use, including, but not limited to
concurrent use agreements (i.e. where there are two pipelines within the
same right of way), Operating Agreements, Agreements with the Owner of the
Gas Plant at the beginning point of the pipeline system, marketing
agreements, etc., if any.
*	Copies of any environmental audits or reviews of the facilities
*	Historical operating statements for the facilities
*	Copies of all lease agreements for the use of the facilities
(Genesis and others)
*	Copies of any structural or integrity reviews or assessments of the
facilities
*	Please provide a description of all jurisdictional authority matters
that affect the ownership/operations of the facility
*	A list of any past violations, spills, or other accidents
*	Copy/list of all title documents to be conveyed in the sale,
including the ROW interests and leases
*	List of consents needed for transfer of the assets being purchased
*	Copies of any specific insurance requirements
*	Please explain the responsibilities for the
decommissioning/abandonment of the facility
*	Copies of construction permits from the federal, state, and parish
agencies that address natural and cultural resources along with any
compensatory mitigation agreements for resource damages
*	Regulatory compliance records, environmental and safety, for DOT or
Louisiana Office of Pipeline Safety as well as alignment sheets




*	What is the agreement/responsibility of the parties with respect to
the old Swift gas plant at the end of the pipeline?  Does LRC's
responsibility extend to the border of the site, or is the site under the
responsibility of LRC?  Who is the current owner of this site if not LRC?
Are there any agreements between the owner of this facility and LRC?
*	Are there any known non-compliance issues with respect to the
facility's operations or current design/layout?
*	Has there been any leaks within the system?
*	Does the Genesis contract require them to pig the line before their
lease expires?  We will most likely need to have the entire line pigged
prior to the transfer of ownership.
*	What is the selling entity for these assets?  If pre-existing
liabilities are discovered, what selling entity would be financially
responsible?
*	What will be the status of the tank inventory and linefill upon
closing the transaction?
