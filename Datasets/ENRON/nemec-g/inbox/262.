Gerald:

I am attaching the draft "Filing Form" of the Servitude Agreement with
my changes in red-line.

Because of some of the wording the Filing Form I had to make some
changes to the Servitude Agreement itself.  A red-lined draft of that
Agreement is also attached.

Please call with any questions.

Keith
