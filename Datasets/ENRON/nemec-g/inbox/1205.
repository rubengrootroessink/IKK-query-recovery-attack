Stacy,

I have three questions about the attached letter. 

1. Are we doing this transaction as ENA or ENA Upstream? 
2. Are the confirms in the name of ENA? The August - October deals were done between ENA Upstream and Linder.
3. Are the confirmations under GTC Spot? I thought they were going to be GTC FIRM.

If you could get back to me regarding these questions, I would appreciate it.

Judy
