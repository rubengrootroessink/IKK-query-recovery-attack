GN,

I am interested. Do you have a back up plan if I can't make it? It sounds
like fun. I hope UH doesn't kick our ass.

Can you believe we are ranked first in some polls? No pressure on Daddy's
Boy Simms.

Gt

Hey GT,  Wanted to see if you are interested in going to the UH-UT game
here in the Big H.  The game is Sat. September 22 at 8 pm.  Tix are $40.
I, along with Eric and another friend are planning on going.  I bought
an extra.  That it might give the wife a chance to visit her Mom while
we get drunk at the game.  Let me know if you are interested.
