Gerald:

    Attached is a revised draft of the letter which the Police Jury
requested prior to the sale.  I took out the reference to "presence of"
referring to hazardous waste.  Please transmute the letter to LRCI
stationery and have a corporated rep sign, and return to me for delivery
to the Police Jury.
