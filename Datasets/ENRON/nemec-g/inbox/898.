If these changes are acceptable to you, Greely would be willing to sign all the contracts.  You know for the deal we have been flowing gas on since April.  

Paul

PS  Only 7 more days!

Paul,
Sorry this has taken so long, but I finally got feedback from John on these
contract documents.   Here is the status of the following documents:

Release of Capacity and Agency Agreements - sending you this back with two
suggested changes in the first section (Scope of Agreement) and additional
language in sectin 5 (Agency).

Transaction Agreement - I am ready to sign off on this document and present
it to Gordon for his signature.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement - sending it up to Legal for
thier initials.  The Legal people sined off on the draft, so this should not
be a problem.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also, I have notified and
awarded the gas contracts  in Colorado covered under the last RFP Greeley
sent out.

Also, on another note.  Are you aware of the scheduled maintaince on CIG at
Ft. Lupton and Young Storage in August?  Greeley had a message from CIG
about some scheduled maintaince at Ft. Lupton that would prohibit storage
injections.  I believe that this was scheduled to last approximately two
weeks.  Please let me know if this is going to cause Enron any problems in
Filling the Young Storage.

Thanks....Robert
