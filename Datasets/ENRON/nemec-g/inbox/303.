Gerald,

John Grass would like to send the GTC Firm Point Specific contract to Torch Energy Marketing, Inc. for a 6 month term deal that will run October - March. Can you please provide the new contract template?

I will fill in the points once we have the template if that is ok with you.

Thanks,
Judy
