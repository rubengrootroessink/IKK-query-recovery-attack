John,

Sorry, during our telephone conference yesterday I should have been more precise about these documents. I have the technical specifications in fax form but I was not able to send them yesterday. I will have clear originals by FedEx today and will fax them this afternoon and send them by overnight for delivery in your office Friday.

About the GPC/ECS contract, we are trying to determine if GPC has a claim of confidentiality that they believe would prevent ECS from disclosing some or all of the contract without their approval. ECS has no objection to producing the contract and I hope that we can get this resolved quickly.


Enjoy your weekend.

Bill
