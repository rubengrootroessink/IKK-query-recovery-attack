Troy, can you call Jill Mearz with TIE and get the same contract information for Gerald. Please forward the information to Gerald as well. Jill (972) 455-2980

Gerald, we are bidding on gas for several IPP's with this company. They are wanting to get a copy of our contract ASAP to begin the initial review process. When Troy forwards you the contract information what would be the turn around for a hard copy and email I could send them.
