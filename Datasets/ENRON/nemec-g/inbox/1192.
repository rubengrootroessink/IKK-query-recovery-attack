Hi.  I was just given Ken Lay's tickets to the Tony Bennett Concert tonight at the Woodlands.  Apparently, they're good seats and we have up front parking.  There are 4 tix and I thought you and what's his name up there that you work with and his wife Jennifer would want to go???? It's not exactly the local acid band but it could be good.  Do you want to go?
