 Tuesday is fine with me, or in the alternative, Wed. is also fine. Just let
me know Gerald, since I know you might have lunch plans with one of your
girlfriends j/k.

Talk to you soon,

Majed

No problem.  I will just destroy the direct deposit slip.  Good luck
with
the write on competition.  Lunch sounds great.  This week is kind of
busy
but maybe next week.  Tuesday or Wednesday?  Yes, I guess we can allow
Debra to go with us.

   Gerald,

   I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding the
message
   you
   left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition for
law
   review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
deposit,
   so
   I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new clerk? I
   hope
   all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch so we
can
   all
   go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want to say
   that it
   was great working with you. Write back soon.

   Best Regards,

   Majed Nachawati
