The last pad gas payment was scheduled for 12/10 for November production and has not been paid to my knowledge.  I think the production period is what may be confusing the issue.

Let me know if you need something else.
Karen

Karen,

I thought the date that the last pad gas payment was due was 12/10.  Am I confusing this date with something else.  If the 10th is the date, are you certain?

Answers to some of your questions in the document.  The 4BCF Date is the date that is 114 days after the last Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment was scheduled to be made in November sometime I think.  However, we have not yet made this payment.
