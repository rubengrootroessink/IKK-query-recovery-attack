Gerald:  I meant to ask you if the slate we designated for LRCI, Inc. would alos work for the other LRC related entities.  Do you think they will?  Please advise and I'll tell Mary Heintiz.  Or naturally, you can discuss this matter with her directly as well.  -Mary O.

Thanks, and I listened to your voice mail about circulating my document as well.  Have you had a chance to ask Gerald about whether this slate of directors will work for the other LRC related entities?
