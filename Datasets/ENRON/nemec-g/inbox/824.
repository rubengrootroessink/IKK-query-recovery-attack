	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment
is necessary, and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The
Houston Bar Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite
1300.
	The HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new
Roster, so please take advantage of this opportunity.
