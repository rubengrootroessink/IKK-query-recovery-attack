Gerald,
In going through your binders, I find that there is much inconsistency in the way it is set up.  I realize you have been through a few assistants, and we all do it differently.  Do you think you would have a few minutes to chat with me about updating and developing a method to file items in the binders?  I am not sure what the retention period is for the agreements, but there are CAs that are a few years old.  Let me know what you would like to do about this.  Thanks!
