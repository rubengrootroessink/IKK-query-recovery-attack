We plan to provide natural gas to the SPV named below. As I understand, Enron Mexico will be have an equity interest. What credit covenants will we require in the Master Firm Agreement?

Stephanie,

Regarding the phone conversation we had earlier today, we already have the name of the SPV that will be transporting the gas.  It is called
Compa??a Energ?a de Baja s. de R.L. de C.V.

If the best option is to use the North Baja Pipeline, which is only 4 miles from the plant, we would need a gas price at the tie point of our pipeline (the SPV's) with North Baja's plus the 22 cents per MMBtu that will go to Enron's de Mexico Risk Management Group. 

Gas volumes have changed somewhat under the new scenario.  We are now modeling a bigger turbine that consumes 321 MMBtu's per day, which makes a daily total of 7,704 MMBtus per day.

Matt Duffy and I will call you tomorrow to discuss the next steps.
Saludos, 

Victor Gonzalez
