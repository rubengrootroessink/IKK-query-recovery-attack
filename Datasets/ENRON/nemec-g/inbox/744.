Please respond to offersDear Gerald R Nemec,
Good news! The credit line on your Capital One
 card has been 
increased to $15,000.00*. This additional credit is available for you to 
use right now! 
Take advantage of your credit line increase to purchase a new 
computer or to go on vacation. Or, consider the Capital One Smart 
Switch(SM) program, which lets you transfer balances from your 
higher-interest-rate credit and charge cards to your Capital One 
account at your current Fixed 9.9% APR! 
Check out our Balance Transfer Calculator  to see how much you 
can save! 
Why Smart Switch?
Smart Switch is a smart move because you could save hundreds of 
dollars in interest every year by transferring higher-interest-rate 
balances. Plus, it lets you write just one check at bill-paying time 
-- and there's no transfer fee! Why pay more interest than you have 
to? Make the switch by calling 1-800-955-7070 today! 
It's Our Way of Saying "Thanks"
We hope you enjoy the extra financial flexibility your new credit 
line provides. It's our way of saying thanks for being a Preferred 
Capital One cardholder. 
Sincerely, 
P. Schnall 
Senior Vice President, Capital One 
P.S. Now it's easier than ever to get the things you want or need. 
Take advantage of your increased line of credit today!
