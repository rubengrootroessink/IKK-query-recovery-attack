Volunteers Needed to Help With a New Project
Junior Judges

Junior Judges:  Helping Kids Make Smart Choicesis a public service project implemented through a curriculum and an accompanying video, hosted by two teenagers, that depicts elementary school aged students faced with challenging decisions.  The project includes seven units and addresses the subjects that affect the lives of the target audience, fourth grade students, including: cheating, destroying property, bullying, teasing, stealing, gangs/weapons, and drugs/alcohol.  Each unit in the curriculum is self-contained so that an educator may use one, all, or just a few of the units, depending on his or her preference and time.  Attorney involvement will include explaining the importance and necessity of laws and rules in society, and moderating the topic discussions following all or some of the video segments.  
Please contact Kent Altsuler at kaltsuler@jw.com if you are interested in volunteering.
 

Volunteers Needed to Help
ADOPT AN ANGEL

For over ten years, the Adopt-an-Angel Program has provided a healthy dose of holiday cheer to over 500 underprivileged students who attend Grimes Elementary School. Children who otherwise would probably not receive gifts during the holidays are presented with clothing and toys donated by Houston lawyers and their staffs. Adopt-an-Angel committee members spend countless hours during a busy time of the year coordinating this impressive endeavor.
Each year, committee members ask every student at Grimes to fill out a "wish list." Although toys are always a favorite, most of the children also list basic clothing items (like socks and underwear) and school supplies. As soon as the committee members receive the lists from the school, they distribute them to attorneys and their staffs who purchase the items and wrap them for delivery. A few days before the students begin their holiday break, the committee members, with the assistance of Santa Claus, deliver the gifts to the children. The children are always delighted by this annual visit. 
In recent years, the Adopt-an-Angel program has been so successful that resources have been used to provide holiday meals and extra clothing to families in particular need, to purchase school uniforms for almost 100 students, and to assist with gifts to a local foster care facility.
