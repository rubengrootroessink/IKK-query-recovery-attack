WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRINT MY OWN TICKETS?
Each ticket you print contains a unique bar code. Treat your
printed tickets just like regular tickets.  Bring your tickets
to the event, one per person, and present them at the entrance
or gate.  An attendant will scan the bar code on your ticket bar
code, and verify it.  You will then be admitted to your event.

Remember to present the entire 8 ? x 11 ticket document that you print.

WHAT IF SOMEONE MAKES A PHOTOCOPY OF MY TICKET?
ONLY ONE SCAN OF THE BAR CODE ON YOUR PRINTED TICKET IS ALLOWED.
Although you can make photocopies of your printed ticket, you run
the risk that someone else will use your copy, or your original.
 If their copy of the ticket is scanned before yours you will need
to present the credit card that was used to make the purchase and a
photo ID in order to verify that you are the original purchaser.

Handle your printed tickets as you would valuables or cash.
