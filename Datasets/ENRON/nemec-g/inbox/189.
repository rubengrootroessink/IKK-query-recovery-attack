STRAWBERRIES ROMANOFF 


1 1/2 pounds firm ripe strawberries, washed, dried, stemmed & quartered
lengthwise (reserve 6 berries with stems for garnish) 
1/4 cup Grand Marnier (can use Triple Sec or Cointreau) 
1/4 cup sugar 
Chantilly Romanoff
3 tbs chopped pistachio nuts (garnish) 

Combine berries and liqueur in large bowl and sprinkle with sugar.
Mix gently with spoon. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4
hours, spooning syrup over berries once or twice. One hour before
serving, divide berries and syrup among 6 sherbert or balloon wine
glasses. Refrigerate. Just before serving, spoon Chantilly Romanoff
over berries and garnish with reserved strawberries. Sprinkle each
serving with pistachio nuts.


CHANTILLY ROMANOFF

1 cup heavy whipping cream, well chilled 
2 tbs Grand Marnier 
1/2 tsp vanilla 
1/2 cup sour cream, chilled 

Beat cream in large mixing bowl until slightly thickened. Add
liqueur and vanilla and continue beating until soft peaks form.
Fold in sour cream, then beat until mixture is thick and holds its
shape. Refrigerate until ready to use.
