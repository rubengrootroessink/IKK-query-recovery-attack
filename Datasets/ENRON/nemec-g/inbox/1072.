Gerald,

I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding the message you
left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition for law
review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic deposit, so
I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new clerk? I hope
all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch so we can all
go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want to say that it
was great working with you. Write back soon.

Best Regards,

Majed Nachawati
