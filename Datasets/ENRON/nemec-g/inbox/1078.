Re:            Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC's 
Storage Well Conversion Application
            Napoleonville Storage No. 1, Serial No. 972568
            Application No. 20406
Our File:  7606-001354
 
Dear Joe:
 
As you know, Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC's application for a permit to convert Napoleonville Storage No. 1 to natural gas service is pending before the Injection and Mining Division.  At this point, Bridgeline Storage Company has responded to the Request for Additional Information from your office dated June 21, 2001 and we await your response to see if any further information is needed prior to setting this application for public hearing.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm our prior conversations concerning dewatering of Napoleonville Storage No. 1.  It is my understanding from our conversations and my review of pertinent regulations that Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC may begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 pursuant to the existing work permit to convert the well.  Unless I hear from you to the contrary, Bridgeline Storage Company will begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 on August 1, 2001.  Of course, Bridgeline Storage Company will not store natural gas in 
Napoleonville Storage No. 1 until an Order has been issued by the Commissioner of Conservation approving such storage.
Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Hand, Jr.
LJH,jr:gms
