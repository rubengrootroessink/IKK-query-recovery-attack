As there were No Comments in "Special Handling" in Sitara, for all deals except for deal # 939857, these deals have already auto-generated and Executed as you can see below.
What does anybody want us to do about that ? Theresa - as you are in town on Thursday, it might be a good idea for us all to get together to discuss procedures...

 Sitara # 939837

 Sitara # 1019836
 Sitara # 1019854
 Sitara # 1019874

Debra,
Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the "minus number" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
