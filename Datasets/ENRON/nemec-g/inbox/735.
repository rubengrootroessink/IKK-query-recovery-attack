Gerald,

Are you familiar with the above two projects?  Maricela Trevino (ext. 53681) and Gareth Bahlmann (37295) in Global Finance are trying to locate the attorney that worked on these two projects.  Last May I helped Roger Balog put together a crude confirmation for Lost Creek and that is the extent of my knowledge on that matter.  

Thanks.
Nony
