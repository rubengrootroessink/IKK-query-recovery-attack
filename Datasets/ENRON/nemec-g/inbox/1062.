Attached is my 1st draft of a Servitude agreement for the Sorrento
pipeline in Assumption, Louisiana.  I used Enron's base agreement and
made numerous changes to comply with Louisiana law, considerations not
addressed in the base agreement, clarity and good grammar.  I also
included some of the provisions of the Sorrento proposed draft. Please
call to discuss.
