Charlie Otto heard that you were the person looking reviewing and approving processing agreements since Dan Hvyl has departed.  Please let me know if this is incorrect.  Attached is an agreement that Charlie would like to have you review and approve before he sends to the customer.  Please contact him with any questions at x35518.
