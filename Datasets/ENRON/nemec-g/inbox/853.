Gerald!

We are trying to establish credit for future transactions with the listed counterparty.  I forward to them a format of our guaranty (Bridgeline Gas Marketing, LLC) and attached is their format.  The proposed reciprocal amount is $5.00MM.  Kindly review their form and provide any comments it any.

Thanks
Rudwell.
