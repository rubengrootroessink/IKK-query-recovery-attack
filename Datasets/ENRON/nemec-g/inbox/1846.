Chris,

Why are they removing language that let's us "..confer with Gulf's project =
management...and subcontractors..."?  What's to hide?  Remember, lack of su=
ch information is what led us to this 11th hour problem to begin with.....r=
eference the information I passed along yesterday.  These folks do not appe=
ar to be familiar with what it takes to manage a fast track project.  They =
don't monitor subcontractors performance on a real-time basis and/or in gre=
at enough detail to understand what is really going on and in order to AVOI=
D problems -- rather than find creative ways to manage them. It's a black b=
ox mentality to construction management, and it's risky.  As I recall, thei=
r attorney said something like "We mange things differently than you might,=
 and that's just the way it is.  Sorry if you (Enron) don't like our style.=
" While he was referring to right-of-way acquisition at that moment, I can =
assure you that their project managers (Howell, Sims, Powell) have the same=
 attitude.  We need to audit construction progress in detail, because they =
will not.

Why don't they want to show us expediting costs?  We're still liable for al=
l incremental costs if someone other than Gulf gets supply jurisdiction, ri=
ght.  Seems to me we're still protecting our interests, which haven't been =
protected very well to date.  (See above!)  How can we not be concerned wit=
h our exposure to (potential) incremental costs?  If we think it is highly =
unlikely that anyone other than Gulf will prevail in the jurisdictional dis=
pute, then maybe we could agree to this.  In any case, without detailed cos=
t tracking we are creating an "incremental cost time bomb".  The only quest=
ion is whether the regulatory / legal processes will set it off. (Pardon th=
e insensitive analogy.) =20

We need access to the information (as requested) in order to protected our =
interests, regardless of who is paying to get this project back on track.  =
If we can only get one of the items I listed, it needs to be direct access =
to the subcontractors.  We may not know the costs, but we will at least abl=
e to make sure construction progress is acceptable, and have a feel for con=
struction-related risks.  If we need to give up something to get the agreem=
ent signed, give up interaction with Gulf Power project team and/or all Gul=
f Power project reporting.  It is very difficult to get a meeting or confer=
ence with them anyway.  Their project tracking and reporting are practicall=
y non-existent, and have no substantial value -- otherwise we wouldn't be i=
n our current predicament. =20

Not sure if this constitutes comments or a short speech, but I hope it help=
s!
