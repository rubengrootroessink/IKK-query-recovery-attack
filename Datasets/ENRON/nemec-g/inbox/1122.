Dear Keith:  Thank you for calling yesterday to ascertain the deadline for information on Assumption Parish records re Enron Storage Company and their conveyance of certain land assets to LRCI, Inc.

If you are able to send somebody to Assumption Parish by the middle of next week to check the records, that will be fine.  We want the process to be cost effective, but please have some information to us by the end of next week.

Thank you,
