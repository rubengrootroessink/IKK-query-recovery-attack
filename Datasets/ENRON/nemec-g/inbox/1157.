Marcus,
Sorry for the delay . . . it's difficult to get folks moving during holiday weeks.  Anyhow, our legal group has indicated that they would like to have a Master Firm Agreement in place with CSU to which we can attach concise Transaction Agreement Exhibits detailing specific deals.  I have attached the Master Firm Agreement for your review and will follow shortly with the Transaction Agreement Exhibit for our swing deal.

 

Please let me know your thoughts on the Master Firm and don't hesitate to call with any questions, comments, and/or concerns.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison
