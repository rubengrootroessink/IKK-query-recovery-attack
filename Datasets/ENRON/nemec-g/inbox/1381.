1. CPS is being audited by the State of Texas and they do not have all required paperwork in place for our account  

2. KEY ISSUE: Will ENA be Sub-Contracting documents out to third parties? If not ENA will need to execute paperwork stating such.

3. Agreements not covered:
	a. Contract that expires Feb 2002 CPS estimated value $20,000,000.00
	b. Contract that expired Feb 2001 CPS estimated value     $900,000.00

4. Enabling Agreement sounds like a parent agreement of the gas purchase agreement they  currently have in place with ENA.

5. Enabling Agreement ENA currently has in place with CPS was signed by Dan Hyvel 

6. Agreements not covered:
	a. Contract that expires Feb 2002 CPS estimated value $20,000,000.00
