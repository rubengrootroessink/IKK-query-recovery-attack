Labor Day weekend . . .
I'm up for whatever you, Jenn, Jeff, Clarke . . . and Gerald, of course . .
.  want to do.  I'll go to bars, parks, concerts, rodeos, restaurants,
beaches, museums and/or just stay at your house.  Whatever.  I can't imagine
that anything you guys want to do would be something that I would be against
doing.  And, if it is then I'll just have something to give you shite about
for the rest of your life.

The Flight:
Northwest Airlines flight #0198 from Minneapolis . . . arrives Thurs Aug 30
@ 4:15 p.m.
Northwest Airlines flight #1277 departs Houston Mon Sept 3 @ 1:05 p.m.

I believe it is a Northwest flight -- not a Continental connection.  The
website and my e-ticket say nothing about Continental.

Again, if providing a ride from/to the airport at those times presents a
problem because of traffic and/or your jobs I don't mind taking a cab --
just let me know.  If no one is around on Friday because you're at work
that's no big deal either -- you don't need to make special arrangements for
me.

Continental Cozumel 2002 vacation pricing is supposed to available on the
web beginning Wednesday I think.  FYI.

I'll be leaving here early today as the Bud Tent awaits me at the Fair.  Oh,
my -- I'm thirsty & hungry.
