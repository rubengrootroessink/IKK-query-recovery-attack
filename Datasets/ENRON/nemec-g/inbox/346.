Uh, oh.  What do we do now?  I hate to send it to contract records undated, because I know that's the first thing they'll need to know for their database.  -Mary

Mary, I hope you are well.  I don't recall the date of that agreement, however Gerald might.  Sorry.  Shonnie

Dear Shonnie:  Do you recall when the Gas Gathering Agreement between ENA and the subject entity was signed in July?  The execution version is not dated, and I want to write the correct date in before I send it to the global database people for inclusion in the database.

Many thanks,
Mary
