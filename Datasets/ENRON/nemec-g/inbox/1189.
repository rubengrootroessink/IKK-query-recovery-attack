Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays - Looked
like you guys were having a good time!
I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No
worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your approach of
straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just have
lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

Jen

P.S.   Tell Mike "no worries"  as well!

Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
"Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"
We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.
;-)

Gerald
