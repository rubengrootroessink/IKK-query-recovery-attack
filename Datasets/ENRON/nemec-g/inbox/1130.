Just got back from Austin. I was at a convention. I was a delegate to the
K.J.Z.T. Insurance Convention at the Omni Hotel.I really enjoyed it learned
quiet a bit. Had dinner with Wayne Saturday nite. It was his birthday. Happy
Birthday Wayne!!!!! He's doing o.k.

passed away Saturday. The rosary is tonight and the funeral tomorrow. She
has been in a nursing home for a while now. She was 83 years old.
