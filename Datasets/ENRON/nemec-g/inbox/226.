No, we should not agree to this provision.

Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse that ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, officer, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whether the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This is the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxious to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasible.

Thanks,

Alisha
