Yes. These deals should have the same reciprocal keep whole language that Mariner and Forest uses. Gerald Nemec is working on finalizing this new language.

Thanks,

Judy,

I am sorry to be a pest, but may I ask you about the 5% special pending language for: 
Q-West Energy 1065012
Cohort Energy 1068138

What should I use here? Is this the keep whole language proposed for Mariner and Forest?


Also,
One other question,   Swift Energy 1049657 (oct 01),  This shows a customer PF trigger price of $2.12 is the $2.12 the net price or is the net price  $2.12 less  .155 =  1.965

Thanks so much, I hope you had a relaxing time off.
