Hi Gerald:  You have given me a letter agreement dated June 20, 2001 binding Enron Compression Services to an agreement between Ridge Energy Storage & Grid Services, L.P. and Operation Energy Corp. dated April 4, 2000. 

Do you have a copy of the April 4 agreement that you meant to send with the letter agreement?
