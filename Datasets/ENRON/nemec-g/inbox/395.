Gerald!

Kindly issue an amendment to our out-going guaranty for the benefit of Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc., executed in May 2000.  We are requesting an increase to $10.00MM.

The increase is to provide support to an existing deal and the counterparty would like to have this amendment as soon as possible.


Thank you for your cooperation.
