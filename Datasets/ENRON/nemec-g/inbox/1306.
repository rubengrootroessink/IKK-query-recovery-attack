Hi Gerald,

What do you suggest we do about this deal - shall I send out a GTC Confirmation ?

This is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.

Thanks
Paul

Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

Regards,
Ellen
