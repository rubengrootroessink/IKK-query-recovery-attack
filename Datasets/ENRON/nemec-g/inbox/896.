He killed everyone but me and now he's looking for me--get ready for
"Halloween 32", starring Ryan Ruppert as Ryan Ruppert and Gerald Nemec as
the guy that always gets killed 3 minutes into the movie.

  Rup,  Got a voicemail at the house from a Michael Moore (wasn't that the
guy in the Halloween movies who killed everybody) concerning a reunion for
the Class of '91.  His number is 641-357-6375.  You can go back and show
all those losers what a big important man you have become.

   G,

   I'm sure you guys rocked--so hard--on Saturday.  If I hadn't been on my
   deathbed I would have toughed it out.  I listened to you guys message as
   it
   came in, I know it you be you guys harassing me.  Laura heard it the
   next
   day and asked "you don't think JT was really over there......do you?"

   Anyway, I guess I owe somebody 16 bucks.   I also need to get your house
   key back to you.  Has any mail or magazines of mine randomly shown up at
   your place, lately?

   OUT!
