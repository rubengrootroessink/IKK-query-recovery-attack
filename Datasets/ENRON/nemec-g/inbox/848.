Hey, I may be in Houston after I get back from Alaska.  I'll let you know
and hope to be able to see you guys!

The rumor is that Mark is going to be moving back to Houston.  He is now
interviewing with companies out there! Lucky you! ;o)

Later, Patricia

  We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao
for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that
Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty
incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being
out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was
in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.
Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

Gerald

   Gerald, glad to hear that you had a wonderful time in China.  What
   cities
   did you visit?  If you have any pics on the web let me know.

   Austin still treating me well.  I could complain but it would not help.
   Work is keeping me busy and I am entering triathlon season, helping my
   brother run the restaurant and working on a new relationship.   A girl
   has
   to keep her plate full! ;o)
   What about you?  How is the law?  Dave told me about his new Colombian
   connection!

   Later, Patricia

   Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding
   occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in
   China
   and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin?

      Dave  and Gerald,

      I just  wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood
   give
      you any  problems?  I hope all is well.

      Thanks,
