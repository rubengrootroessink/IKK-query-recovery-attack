Dear Fellow Diver;

Ok, ok, I know I said I'd do better job of getting these out on time, but now you can stop sending me emails asking when the next newsletter is coming out!  Here's a quick update. We've added about 11,000 new fellow divers to this month's newsletter, which brings us up to about 260,000 PADI Divers worldwide, making this the most widely read newsletter in the industry!

From the entry-level certification numbers we're seeing, you're all doing your part by  bringing many new divers into our great sport.  Please keep up the good work.  However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.

About a month ago, the Regional Managers (that's our great team of sales/training people who visit retailers and resorts), for PADI Americas had a great sales meeting on Orcas Island in Washington.  We all worked hard and dived hard while we were there.  We stayed at the Rosario Resort (a really cool place by the way!)(http://www.rosarioresort.com)  and would like to thank Ron Kenny from Island Dive and Water Sport for showing us a great time and some fantastic diving. If you're in the area, or just want to dive with a giant octopus, give Ron a call.  Great customer service and good times are guaranteed. Check out Island Dive and Water Sport at www.divesanjuan.com. Be sure to tell Ron that I told you about his operation. I love it when PADI retail and resort operators call me to say someone mentioned the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter to them!

I'd also like to thank all of you who took the time to review the consultation document  (http://www.padi.com/news/archive/last/052901_wargraves/ ) online and responded in favor of allowing responsible wreck diving, while respecting our underwater cultural heritage.  PADI on behalf of the diving industry at large is making progress on this subject and will keep you informed.

What are you doing from 26-31 July? Well, if you happen to be in Australia, swing by the Sydney Boat Show and say hello to our team from the PADI Asia Pacific office and visit all of our hard working resort and retail members exhibiting there.  This is the largest boat show in the Southern Hemisphere and this year it has a Dive Expo area. Check it out at www.sydneyboatshow.com.au. and be sure to tell the PADI staff at the show that you read about it in this newsletter.
If you've recently checked the PADI homepage, you may have seen a very historic dive industry news item (http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/todaynews/062701_historique/). On 13 June 2001, PADI and the F?d?ration Fran?aise d'?tudes et de Sports Sous-Marin (FFESSM/French Federation) agreed to work together in developing France's dive industry. The historic accord represents the start of mutual cooperation for the benefit of France's dive industry and divers worldwide.   Jean-Claude Monachon, CEO PADI Europe, summed it up best by saying, "You can come to France and dive, that's important. Divers from Europe and around the world can come to this country and experience our fabulous diving. That benefits both France and diving."

A little over a month ago, the youth chamber of commerce (JCE) from Fr?jus / St. Rapha?l, France conducted a beach cleanup that attracted a lot of media attention.  All summer long in the port of St. Rapha?l on the Mediterranean, Project AWARE pamphlets are being passed out to divers and visitors alike.  Good job to everyone involved!
The Protect the Living Reef initiative is a big success with many Project AWARE Patrons (https://www.padimembers.com/Sforms/aware/default.htm) requesting brochures, stickers and lapel pins.  The new manual, A.W.A.R.E. Our World, Our Water (http://www.padi.com/aware/get_involved/LivingReef/news/022601_ourworld_ourwater/) is really taking off as well. If you haven't read it yet, go by your PADI Dive Center or Resort and get your copy today.  And, don't forget the deadline for the Project AWARE Photo Contest (http://www.padi.com/aware/photo_2001/ ) is July 31st.
Now, get your calendar out and circle September 15th. Then, visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort and find out how you can participate in this year's International Clean-Up Day.  It's not too early to begin working with your local dive facility or organizing your own cleanup.  For details on any of the global Project AWARE programs, visit http://www.padi.com/aware/.
I am buying drinks again this year at the PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion event in Grand Cayman 8-15 November (http://www.padi.com/ptn/weeklyspecial/).  I will be there for the first few days, so if you catch me there and tell me you're a Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter reader, I'll buy you a drink (underage readers get soda!) We've already got more people going than last year, so don't delay, book your trip now!  Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort, or contact PADI Travel Network for details.

Last but not least, for you last minute travelers, it's not too late to join Bob Coleman, Director of Marketing and Malene Thompson, Manager of Public Relations for PADI Americas during Cayman Country http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/travelnews/070201_cometocaymancountry/, August 1-5 and 8-12. Country music stars (and PADI divers) Travis Tritt, The Wilkinsons, Rascal Flats (winner of the Country Music Association's Best New Group) and SheDaisy are scheduled to perform, along with favorites the Kinleys and Chris Cagle.  Again, contact your PADI Dive Center or PADI Travel Network to make it happen. If you run into Bob, be sure to tell him you read the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter. He might just have something for you!

Are you going diving this weekend?  If not, please do me one more favor. Take this newsletter into your local PADI facility and tell them Brian said to stop by and ask what's new?  They will not only appreciate the visit, but while you're there you can begin planning your next dive adventure, check out the latest in dive equipment or move up the diving ladder by signing up for your next PADI course!

Now, get a friend and go diving!

Brian Cronin.
