Hey Geraldo,

It would be great to see Paul go far in his Navy career, the military can use
more guys of his caliber.........

I had not seen the writings on the bombs, that's great, I'm sure those guys are
motivated to do their jobs well............

Wow, that's great news about Sharon.  This is her first, right?

My sister is now engaged.  She and her fiance moved into an apartment off of
Memorial Drive.  He's an engineer (UT grad as well, civil engineering I think)
and works for Chicago Bridge & Iron.  So we are relieved she hooked up with a
good guy.  She's 27 going on 18, so yes, it's kind of wierd to see your little
sister growing up before your eyes.

We definitely need to get you out to the house.  We just had laminate wood and
tile flooring put in to part of the house, so it's a bit more presentable now.
The cheapo original carpet was getting pretty trashed.  My kids are getting big
fast, they're a lot of work but getting to be a lot of fun too.  All the talk
arouond the house is of Hallloween, they're looking forward to it.

OK bud, gotta get a presentation ready for a meeting this a.m.

Let's hook up soon,
EZ

Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons
Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an
engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.

Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on
the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!

Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is
an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the
luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a
little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister
starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.
Let me know when you get some time.

G

   Gerald,

   Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT,
   just
   lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

   The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to
   the
   Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season
   is
   shot.........

   Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will
   tell
   you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

   I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out
   here.
   Take care.  Paul.
