Gerald,

The name of the guy in Lafayette, LA who can do a title search for us if we need him to is Art LeBlanc, (337) 233-9099.  However you would like to handle it is fine with me. 

Like I mentioned on the phone, Roger Westbrook is the one helping with the ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting on the Crawfish land.  He indicated some time back that he had received some of the drawings from Bridgeline.  If needed, I can set up a meeting with Roger once we know the status of the documents.  

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help on either of these.

Thanks,

Rakhi
