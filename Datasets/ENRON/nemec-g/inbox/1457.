Attached is a cash use approval request for the cash distributon for 4th quarter to the investing partner of ECS, LLC.  Please review the form as soon as possible as I would like to get this on the five day rollforward list in the morning.  Payment is due on 12/28/01 as our investing partner EMP ECHO has an obligation to pay their creditor on 01/02/02.  Patty Melcher, representative of EMP ECHO, called today requesting a status update on outstanding issues relating to ECS, LLC including this distribution.

Funding for this distribution is to be made out of the ECS LLC's bank account which has sufficient funds to make this distribution as well as the outstanding electricity invoices.  Karen Gruesen will send a follow up e-mail confirming the balance in the bank accounts.

Karen and I are continuing to work on the financial statements and as discussed with Patty will be forwarded as soon as completed for the first three quarters of 2001 which had previously not been completed.
