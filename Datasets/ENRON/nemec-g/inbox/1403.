Lets meet from 4:00 to 4:45 on the 5th floor of ECS.  As it stands now - we need to understand what happens under the agreements in the event that we pull LRCI into bankruptcy.

Case 1:  Do Nothing - Dow terminates lease and brine service agreement, traps gas in storage, LRCI cannot complete Enron #1, LRCI pays penalty payments to Bridgeline for not making storage capacity available, LRCI defaults under Contribution Agreement.  

Case 2: LRCI in Bankruptcy - ? 

We need to make a call.

Regards,
Brian

Probably need to include Jim Coffey on this, as his group will ultimately be responsible for the accounting for the Bridgeline investment.  I am available at 4 pm but will need to leave at 5.  Let me know if we will be able to get a meeting together today.
Thanks,
Karen

It turns about that there are conflicts with 9:30.  How about 10:30?
