Gerald:

I do not think we should be initialling on behalf of EES.  I suggest that you call Jim Keller at EES and discuss this with him to see how he would want to handle this.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues.
