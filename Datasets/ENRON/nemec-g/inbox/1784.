> HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE...

> If we could shrink the earth's population to a

>
> There would be:
> 57 Asians
> 21 Europeans
> 8 Africans
> 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
>
> 52 would be female
> 48 would be male
>
> 70 would be non-white
> 30 would be white
>
> 70 would be non-Christian
> 30 would be Christian
>
> 89 would be heterosexual
> 11 would be homosexual
>
> 6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's
> wealth and all 6 would be from the United States.
>
> 80 would live in substandard housing
> 70 would be unable to read
> 50 would suffer from malnutrition
> 1 would be near death; 1 would be near birth
> 1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education
> 1 would own a computer
>
> When one considers our world from such a compressed

> If you woke up this morning with more health than

>
> If you have never experienced the danger of battle,
> the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture,

> people in the world.
>
> If you can attend a church meeting without fear of
> harassment, arrest, torture, or death...you are more
> blessed than three billion people in the world.
>
> If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on
> your back, a roof overhead and a place to sleep...you

> richer than 75% of this world.
>
> If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and
> spare change in a dish someplace ... you are among the

> If your parents are still alive and still married you

> If you can read this message, you just received a

> two billion people in the world that cannot read at

>
> Work like you don't need the money.
> Love like you've never been hurt.
> Dance like nobody's watching.
> Sing like nobody's listening.
> Live like it's Heaven on Earth.
>
> And, have a Happy Thanksgiving!
