You are correct sir.  DJ is a man among 18 to 22 year old boys.  He has that
same "special something" that we saw in Vasher and Roy last year.  He will
be a good at UT for as long as he chooses to stay.

I'll be looking for at the game . . . shouldn't be hard to find you among
the other 200 people in attendance.

Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just
kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy
within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the
girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.
Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are
going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4
hours a day are over.

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon,
even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in
the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double
teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is
very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching
him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look
silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting
now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more
talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able
to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be
the one wearing burnt orange.
