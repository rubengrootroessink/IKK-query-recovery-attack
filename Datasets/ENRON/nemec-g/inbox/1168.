Yeah, in AEW's eyes everything eventually becomes my problem or fault.  I'll be a monkey's uncle if she ever gave me fully executed conveyance documents that were properly filed with the Clerk of Assumption Parish.  What she probably did give me was an e:mail or a print out of any e:mail of documents designed to effect the Enron Storage Company conveyance to LRCI, buy I'm not even sure that's the case.  

Oh well.  Thanks for following up on the Search.

Steve

Steve, Yes, I did receive a response from Robert Rose about the Napoleonville conveyance.  Ann Elizabeth has said she gave the file to you, so we're still in a position to do a complete search.  -Mary

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
"Enron" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document
search.
Best wishes,
Mary
