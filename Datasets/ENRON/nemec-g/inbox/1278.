	I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some
stock today.  I think the punding you guys have taken is getting a little
carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I think
your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
do.....................

	Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to
go into my busy planning period, Sept-Nov, so not looking forward to that
much.  Kids are doing well and two of my three start pre-school next week,
so mama is relieved.

	Take care,
	E

	Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
little
	early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
good
	time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

	It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
last
	week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
the new
	car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
on
	Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

	Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
him
	since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

	     Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
are
	flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
(sp?), a
	place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
there at
	about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
to the
	downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
of mine
	from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
well.
	Are
	you game?

	     Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:
281-687-6893.
	I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

	     later,
	     E

	     Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
getting
	into
	     Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
(281)
	772-9250.
	     If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
don't
	you just
	     call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
we'll
	ride
	     over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
seeing
	with me.
	     My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
	wedding is
	     at 7.

	     Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

	     G

	Hotel Room Confirmation








	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.
