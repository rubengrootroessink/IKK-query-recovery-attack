Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.  Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal, but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you have them or know where they are.  

Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document search.

Best wishes,
Mary
