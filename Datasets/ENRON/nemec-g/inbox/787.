G--
Next week when you get settled in, call me and I will come over to discuss this agreement and the Trading Partner agreements that Jeff Hodge has asked that I hand off to you (I know you love that but know that I suggested Stacey get the TPA's--but Jeff thought you were the man!!) Mary O will be handling most of the routineTPA issues---

This Tenaska contract has been out there for a long time and i had tried from time to time to get an OK from Darren and Rick Hill--but, in true Enron form, what was an emergency in october you couldn't pay people to deal with in April--Darren did respond to me at the end of May when I was in the throws of Triple Lutz and I think he is now interested in wrapping this up--I told him I was passing it along to you--it should just be some tweeking--but we can chat next week! Hope China was awesome--We will all miss you!

Sandi

Sandi, 

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.  How do we get this corrected?

Darren,
do you know what the situation is with getting that Tenaska agreement signed? it is on a list to be assigned to HPL in the sale and I don't think it has ever been executed--I know you left  me  a message a week or so ago about this--is there any information that i owe you ?
