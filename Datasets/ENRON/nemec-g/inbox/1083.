WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRINT MY OWN TICKETS?
Each ticket you print contains a unique bar code. Treat your printed tickets just like regular tickets.
Bring your tickets to the event, one per person, and present them at the entrance or gate.  An attendant
will scan the bar code on your ticket bar code, and verify it.  You will then be admitted to your event.

Remember to present the entire 8 ? x 11 ticket document that you print.

WHAT IF SOMEONE MAKES A PHOTOCOPY OF MY TICKET?
ONLY ONE SCAN OF THE BAR CODE ON YOUR PRINTED TICKET IS ALLOWED.
Although you can make photocopies of your printed ticket, you run the risk that someone else will use
your copy, or your original.  If their copy of the ticket is scanned before yours you will need to
present the credit card that was used to make the purchase and a photo ID in order to verify that
you are the original purchaser.

Handle your printed tickets as you would valuables or cash.
