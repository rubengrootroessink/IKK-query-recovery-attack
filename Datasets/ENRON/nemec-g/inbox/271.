Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

JK
