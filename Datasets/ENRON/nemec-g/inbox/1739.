Gerald,

Have you gotten a chance to look over the ROW document?  It seems to be a pretty standard agreement.  If possible, we would like to get this finalized soon.  Once we hit the middle of Dec, it will probably be harder to get anything done.  

Let me know if you have any questions on the agreement.

Thanks,

Rakhi
