Let me just bring everyone up to speed on the det's of Saturday's super-def
throwdown jam:

Start time:  8 bells
Seating:  Limited
Booze available:  Cheap beer and select liquors from my personal stock
Dress code:  Shabby Sheik aka GeoWear
Address:  2735 Steel Street

So in review, if you have lawnchairs you might want to bring some along for
yard overflow seating.  As for the sauce, if you prefer a certain gourmet
beer bring it with you cause you aint gettin' it here.  Liquor and wine is
always welcomed.  The location is just down the street from Carrie Nolan's
for those of you who have been to parties at her place--those of you that
haven't, first of all your lucky, and secondly, here's where we're at:  One
street north of Alabama, west of Kirby Drive (Directly west of the Whole
foods).  The street has a canopy of trees and is lined with apartments,
were at the west end of the apartment complex, just look for the jugglers
and mimes performing outside.

Look forward to seeing all of you, at least as long as I can see.

Cheers,
Ryan
