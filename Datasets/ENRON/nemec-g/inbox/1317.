Lori:  Mary Ogden called today looking for the documentation supporting the appointment of Louise Kitchen as a director - I went through minute book, documents to be scanned, documents scanned and to be filed, and also what was in your office and sent to Mary Heinitz.  I also spoke to Peggy-and she indicated that she was not working on this.  Please let me know if there is somewhere else I should have looked or called to locate documents (perhaps Angela Davis or Travis).  Also she needed to adopted some resolutions by the Board of Directors - I advised her that we still did not have a replacement for Frevert and that currently the Board only has two members -that if she provided me with another member I would be happy to prepare Consent appointing to fill vacancy created by Frevert's removal/resignation.
