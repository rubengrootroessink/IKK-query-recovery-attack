Rudwell, 
Per our telcon, the attached document is the Corporate Guarantee that Aquila Inc. is offering on behalf of ACN Energy to provide credit support.  We propose replacing our parental guarantee from ACN Inc. with the Aquila guarantee.  This will allow us to have a larger credit line and increase our ability to purchase supplies from Enron.  Thank you for your review.
