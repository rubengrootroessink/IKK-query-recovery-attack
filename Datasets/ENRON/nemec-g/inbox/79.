Great!  We appreciate Enron North America's past support and look forward to your participation this year.  (I have copied the members of the HBA Subcommittee so that they will be aware of Enron's plans to participate.) We will send you the program information as it becomes available.  Participation by the City's corporate leaders such as Enron is a key to the success of this program.  Thanks.
