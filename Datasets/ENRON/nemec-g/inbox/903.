Gerald,
The following e-mail was sent to Christian Yoder requesting some language that would be used in power contracts with respect to municipal entities.  I have not had any response from Christian, can you please follow up, or have Harlan get with him.

Thanks
Russell

Christian - Please forward my fellow credit associate, Russell Diamond, a copy of the language commonly used in our municipal contracts pertaining to the following two issues:  i) rate making authority and ii) regulation out (decision to enter into a non-regulated market).  To the extent that there is other language that would be useful, please provide.  thks
