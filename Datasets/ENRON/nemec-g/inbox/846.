-------------------- 
MSN Messenger Service is a great free service that helps people stay in touch. It tells you when your friends are online and lets you exchange instant messages online.
It's fast and easy to sign up, and it's free! If you don't already have the software, just click here  to go to the MSN Messenger Service web site to get more information and to install it.
Once you've installed MSN Messenger Service, add me to your list of contacts: my e-mail address is cinbad35@hotmail.com. (You might want to write my address down because you will need it when adding me to your list.)
I look forward to sending you an instant message soon!
