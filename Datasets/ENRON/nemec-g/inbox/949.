These changes are fine.  May and Kathleen, would you please coordinate who is going to get the redraft to Dynegy.  Also, we will probably have to hook Gerald into this process (for initials purposes anyway) while I'm gone Wednesday through next Tuesday.

Steve,

The folks at Dynegy called me Friday evening to give me their comments to the NC Projects CA.

1) The appropriate entity is Dynegy Marketing & Trade

2) In the return of confidential information section, they want to be able to either return the confidential information or destroy it and deliver a certificate to ENA of the destruction.

Can we get a revised CA out to them this afternoon?

Thanks,

Jon
