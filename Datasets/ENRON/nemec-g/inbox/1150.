I haven't heard from you in a while and wanted to see what was up.
Colorado was incredible!  The house is now in the building stages and
it is all very exciting.  I had so much energy in the cool weather it
was unbelievable.  I am now past the 8 month mark and have about 7
weeks to go.  I am so ready!

I was thinking about your screen play the other day.  Did you ever
seriously work on it?  Is it still in progress?

What is going on in your love life?  Are you still with Barbara?
Give me an update.

Love and miss you!  Your nephew says hello!!
