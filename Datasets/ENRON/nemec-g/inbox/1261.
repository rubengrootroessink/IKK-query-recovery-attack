Shahnaz,

I've attached a document Donna requested that I forward to you to begin the EDI setup for pipes on ES.  If you have any questions on the enclosed please advise.  

Regards, 
Lisbet Newton.

On a side note:

Hope your trip went well.  I'm assuming you didn't get stuck in a swamp or end up putting your other two passengers in the trunk!!  Ha ha...
