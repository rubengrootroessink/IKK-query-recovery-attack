Bill -

The conference call was to discuss the Staff's draft of issues to be resolved in the territorial dispute. I can give you further information about the issues and participants in the call if you like. Staff will make recommendations to the Commission regarding the issues.

In regard to the time line, nothing has been posted on the Internet. Commissioner Jaber is the prehearing officer. The due date for submission of testimony is July 16. Rebuttal testimony will be due 3 weeks later (Aug. 6). The prehearing conference is August 23 and the hearing is set for September 5.
