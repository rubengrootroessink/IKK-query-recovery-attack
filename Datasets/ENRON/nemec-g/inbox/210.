Gerald,

Please review the attached denial letter for the September 10th portion of the W&T Force Majeure. I am still waiting on a copy of the confirmation to verify that we used the Enfolio Committed Reserves and what date is on it; however, the customer cited the Enron North America GISB as the governing contract. How do you want to handle these disparities?

Please advise if you have any concerns.

Thanks,
Judy
