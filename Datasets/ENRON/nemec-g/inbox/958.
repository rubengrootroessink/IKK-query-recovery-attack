Gerald and Mary,
 
While I am out, I may need your help on this and other "so called" Project Neptune matters.  These are clean up matters that Ann Elizabeth White was handling for Patrick Johnson, Brandi Morris and Rakhi Israni.  All my files on these Louisiana/Bridgeline related matters are in my left hanging file behind the  Tab labeled "Project Neptune"
 
Thanks,
 
Steve

Keith,
 
Please let me know your timing on the Sorrento Pipeline matter I forwarded to you Saturday.  As you can see from the following, Sorrento is a bit anxious.  I will be out Wednesday through next Tuesday, so it would be great if we can touch base before then.  Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Mr. Johnson,
 
If I can be of any help to you in expediting the completion of the R/W for Sorrento Pipeline please let me know. Sorrento is trying to purchase all Pipeline R/W for August 20, which is the initial start date of the construction phase.
 
Thanks
