	FYI,


	Here is a copy of the Draft agreement with the addition of text in red
	that Barbara wanted to incorporate as part of our "template".  Oakhill
	will not get the red in this draft.  The text in blue is what I added or 
	changed with Barbara's input.  

	We've incorporated a few new concepts:
		- we have a "date certain" for our deal to start
		- I've provided for operation before our "Start Date" (because
		  we've mitigated construction risk by pushing the Start Date
		  back).  This is termed the "Pre-Start Date Period" which can
		  begin after we have completed the "Facility Testing" and deemed
		  the facility suitable and ready for commercial operation.  
		- I've reduced the most of the response and notifications timing
		  from the customer to ECS.
