Gerald/Debra,

There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc. contract. We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day. 

Also, could you please let me know approximately how long it will take to be able to provide Jill with a draft to send to the customer? We need to get something to the customer on Monday if at all possible.

Thanks,
Judy
