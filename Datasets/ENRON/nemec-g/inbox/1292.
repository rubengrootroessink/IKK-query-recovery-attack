Keith,  Attached is the revised PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse.  I removed the mineral rights reservations and added in the sales price.  Please review. The agreement needs to be forwarded for review by the Assumption Police Jury as follows:

Attn:  Kim Torres
Assumption Parish Police Jury
P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

Let me know if you have any questions.
