Oh my gosh!

Just found out right after I got off the phone with you that I am no longer
going to see Madonna.  We couldn't give the guy a definite yes and he had to
go ahead and sell the tickets.  Yikes.  I think I am going to kill myself.
Was it bad luck talking with you??

Ha! Ha!

Anyway, I enjoyed talking with you!  Have a good time in S. Carolina this
weekend!
