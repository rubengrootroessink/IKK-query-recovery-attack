Gerald,

I found out that the provision that everyone keeps calling a ROFR is actually a shotgun bidding process.  I am interested in reading the relevant provisions of the document relating to this.  Apparently, if either party wants to sell, it must give purchase price to the other partner and then that other partner has the option to either buy or sell its interest at that price.  This provision may be unenforceable under bankruptcy law if the partner is a debtor.  Please have your assistant provide me with a copy of the partnership agreement ASAP.  Thanks very much.

Regards

Stuart
