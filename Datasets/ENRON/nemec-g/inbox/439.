Gerald,

Per my discussions with John Grass, we have decided to allow the Force Majeure for the September 11 - 15th; however, we will not allow the September 10th Force Majeure. Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from us in order to bring this issue to closure.

Thanks,
Judy
