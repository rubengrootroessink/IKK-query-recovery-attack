	Gerald,
	Here is the Term Sheet that has been submitted to Oakhill for some time.  

	It should reflect the following:

	7000 hp ( 2 units rated at 3500 hp each)
	Hanover is expected to package, install and finance for ECS under a 10 yr contract
	ECS will basically Lease - Purchase from Hanover

	Hanover will provide all Maintenance for the contract term for a defined cost.  (I'm working the cost with Hanover)
	
	Power provider = Rusk County Electric Cooperative
	Rate structure = special structure whereby RCEC commits to term fixed T&D, fixed Generation and fixed Ancillary Services
		(EES and ENA are basically a no bid on providing the power into SWEPCO & RCEC)
