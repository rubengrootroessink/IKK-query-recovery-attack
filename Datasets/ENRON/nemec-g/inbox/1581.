Jennifer Bello is a recruiter for Sedona Consulting here in Houston. She
does financial and accounting recruiting. She called me, and I thought of
your brother.
Her number is: 713.868.3960, and e-mail is jobs@sedonaconsulting.net

Didn't know if he would be interested. I also have that contact for the
legal recruiters if you get in trouble.

Later,
