Let's plan on Wednesday.  How about we meet at Treebeard's in the tunnel
around 12.  Let me know if that works for you.  If you are not a fan of
Treebeards we can do something else.

    Tuesday is fine with me, or in the alternative, Wed. is also fine.
Just
   let
   me know Gerald, since I know you might have lunch plans with one of
your
   girlfriends j/k.

   Talk to you soon,

   Majed

   No problem.  I will just destroy the direct deposit slip.  Good luck
   with
   the write on competition.  Lunch sounds great.  This week is kind of
   busy
   but maybe next week.  Tuesday or Wednesday?  Yes, I guess we can
allow
   Debra to go with us.

   Gerald

      Gerald,

      I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding the
   message
      you
      left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition
for
   law
      review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
   deposit,
      so
      I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new clerk?
I
      hope
      all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch so
we
   can
      all
      go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want to
say
      that it
      was great working with you. Write back soon.

      Best Regards,

      Majed Nachawati
