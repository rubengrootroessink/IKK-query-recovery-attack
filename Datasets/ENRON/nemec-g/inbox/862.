John,

Thanks for your help with the TGP deal.  Corey wants you to send him a confirmation by Tuesday of next week.  Gerald Nemec has the GISB and is reviewing it, he will get back to us asap on it.  ( I told him to contact you with any questions)

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

John
