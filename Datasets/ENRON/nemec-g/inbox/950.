All -

Attached is a worksheet for a new ENFOLIO with Wheelabrator Lassen.  This counterparty is looking to transact on a 5-year deal sometime next week, so we need to get this executed as soon as possible.

Please prepare a draft at your earliest possible convenience.  I will forward the email address of the contact as soon as possible.


Thanks,

Jay
