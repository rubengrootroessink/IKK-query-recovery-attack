Jeff-
This was a deal a gave to Stacy D. on November 6, 2001, and she was suppose to give it back to me with some peaking option language.  I know everything is crazy, but I was wondering if someone could help me out.  If anything let me know if we even need to confirm this deal anymore.  I have a deal ticket and some comments.

Thanks
Richard

Stacy-
Here is the confirm for the peaking option deal we spoke about.  Let me know when you are at your office so I can bring up the deal ticket and terms of the deal.  Did not input the price on the fee section (# 5) because I was not sure how to put it in as a peaking option.
