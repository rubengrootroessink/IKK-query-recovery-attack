Nelson,

Here is the latest version of the MMS Keep Whole that I have. I believe that we were waiting on the language from Gerald that tweeked their relevant gas day language.

Let me know if you need the latest version of the language that MMS provided to us with the Relevant Gas day language.

Thanks,
Judy
