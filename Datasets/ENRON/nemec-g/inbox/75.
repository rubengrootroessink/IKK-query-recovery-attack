Gerald, 

I met with Roger Westbrook on Friday about the Bridgeline easements.  We figured out what info we already have and what we still need.  Attached is an email from Roger to Joel Milliet from Bridgeline regarding what we still need.  

I am working with Roger on putting together the ROW agreement.  I will send it to you for review once we were are done.  Roger is out of town this week so you can probably expect something from us by the middle of next week.  In the meantime, could you please put together the special warranty deed for the sale of the 2.82 acres to Bridgeline?  The price agreed on is $6500/acre. 

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi
