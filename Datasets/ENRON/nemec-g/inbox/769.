A sitting federal judge has not only endorsed the bid
concept embodied by Provere.com, he has awarded 'Lead
Counsel' status using competitive bidding. The case
involved was a securities fraud class action, styled
In re Quintus Securities Litigation.  The bidding was
conducted by Judge Vaughn Walker, U.S. District, Northern
District of California (San Francisco).

You can now use Provere's patent pending technology to post
cases (when you need to refer a case) and to bid (or post
proposals) for legal work from businesses and consumers
