I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   
 
Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)
