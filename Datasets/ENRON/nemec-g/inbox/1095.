Gerald,  I hate to do this to you, but Carlos is out of the office until tomorrow and we need to get Ben Jacoby's signature on the attached letters before he leaves today at 1:30.  Please review the attached letters (I do not believe they should refer to ENA who is apparently not a party to the agreement that is being terminated).  Please advise.

Kathleen

Carlos,

The TRANSCO Precedent Agreement termination date is coming up (August 3, 2001).  Attached, please find drafts of the letter to terminate.  Please provide any comments.

We need to be ready to send in this letter by the end of the week via FedEx if we can not get the Termination Date pushed out one or two months at a minimum.

I spoke with TRANSCO today and they indicated that we should know tomorrow AM if extending the termination date for a couple of months will be possible.

Thanks.


RDG
