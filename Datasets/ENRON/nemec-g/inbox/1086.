Hi Gerald!

We have received a request from El Paso to amend our existing guaranty  executed on June 1, 2000 for the benefit of several of its subsidiaries, to add another subsidiary (Southern Natural Gas Company) and to increase the amount by $2.5MM to $5.00MM.  

If you have any questions please give me a call.
