Lloyd,

Which contracts are you talking about?  The Asset Management Agreement between ENA and AGI Highstar or the 2 Operation and Maintenance Agreements between G.L.C.Consulting Service Incorporated and each of Lumberton Power, L.L.C. and Elizabethon Power, L.L.C.   Or were you referring to something else?

Steve

Steve could you email the final contracts associated with the plant manager and energy managers.

Tom May and myself will be at Lumberton tomorrow to discuss a new services agreement and would like the history.

Thanks.
