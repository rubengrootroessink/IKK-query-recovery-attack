Gerald, the text below is from a financing agreement that involved a Mexica=
n company.  I would use from it what you can but would talk to Andy Edison =
as to what would work in your agreement and whether he has any specific for=
m.  There are two critical issues related to your deal -- one is to get a U=
S court to be able to recognize the arbitration award and two would be in t=
he event that your Mexican counterparty does not have assets in the US, the=
n you would want to next be able to a Mexican court to recognize and enforc=
e  your US court judgment enforcing your arbitration award.
