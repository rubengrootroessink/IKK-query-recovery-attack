Gerald,

Per our conversation, here is the addendum of provisions for Charlie Otto's deal with BHP Petroleum. As I mentioned, Charlie is expecting to close on this deal within a day or two and the customer is awaiting our comments on these provisions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your help.
Judy Thorne

On second thought, I probably should attach a copy of the document.  Ooops!



Charlie,

Well, upon review, the lawyers wanted me to bounce the following
"Transaction Confirmation" document off you.  It references your Enfolio
Purchase contract, but give a bit more details than your Conformation sheet.
Let me know what you think as soon as possible.  Thanks,

Dan
