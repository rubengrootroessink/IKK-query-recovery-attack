Sorry about the delay.  I had to figure out where the IT guy's had moved all this stuff when Shawna departed.  Let me know if you have questions.

Hi Gerald,

I didn't get a copy of the new Committed Reserves/First Purchaser GTC from you last night.  I didn't know you if you forgot or if there was a problem with the email, so I thought I'd ask again.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.
