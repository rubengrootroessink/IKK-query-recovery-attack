FYI,

Today is the last day to make benefit enrollment elections.  You can call x37979, option number 5 to make changes.  You will need the company number, which is 0741.  Your pin is the last 4 digits of your social security number.  Savings enrollment options will be able to be changed at any point after November 20, and is not tied in with today's deadline.  Thanks,

Keegan
