     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help. Our number is toll free: 1.877.4.LAWNET [877.452.9638] or see us on the web at: http://www.thelaw.net
