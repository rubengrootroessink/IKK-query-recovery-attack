G,

I think Heather's Mom will be at the house next weekend. It's Heather's
B-Day. Will another weekend work?

Sorry you and Barb broke up but se la vi-How the hell do you spell that
french shit? Anyway there are other fish in the sea dude. Go for a twenty
one year old so I can salivate.

No Le Hace is scheduled for Aug 31. Mark your calendar.

GT

Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip
next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be
myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships
seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am
working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.
