Gerald:  Lisa Druzbik has asked me for some "generic exclusivity wording." =
 I pulled the following paragraph from one of Steve's documents.  Is it OK =
to send this to her?  Please advise.  Thanks, -Mary O.

Exclusivity.  In consideration of the efforts to be expended by Seller in p=
roviding information with respect to the Assets and the exclusivity rights =
 granted below, Buyer agrees to pay Seller  ________________ Dollars ($____=
_______) as an earnest payment "Earnest Payment", within  ___ days of the e=
xecution of this Agreement.  In consideration of the efforts to be expended=
 by Buyer in undertaking its due diligence review of the Project and Assets=
, Seller hereby grants to Buyer, during the Term of this Agreement (the "Ex=
clusivity Period") the exclusive right to pursue the Project with Seller.  =
During the Exclusivity Period Seller shall not work with any other persons =
with regard to the Project or pursue any other transaction involving the As=
sets. The Earnest Payment shall be credited against the agreed upon purchas=
e price for the Assets set forth in the Definitive Agreement(s).  If the Pa=
rties do not complete a sale of the Assets, Seller shall retain the Earnest=
 Payment without further obligation to Buyer.
