Please see the attached letter notifying Enron North America Corp. of outstanding transportation invoice amounts payable to Transwestern Pipeline Company for capacity acquired from Citizens Communications Company for November 2001, which were due on December 14, 2001.  Feel free to contact me at (713) 853-6928 if you have any questions related to these transactions.
