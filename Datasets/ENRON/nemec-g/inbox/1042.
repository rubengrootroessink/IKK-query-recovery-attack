GT,  That's cool.  Tell Heather happy B-day.    I will put No Le Hace on my
calendar.  Wouldn't miss it this time.  The next couple of weekends are
busy, so I might just wait until the No Le Hace festivals to make it to
Austin.

How is everything else going?  Have you been taking it easy at work, since
the summer is here?

   G,

   I think Heather's Mom will be at the house next weekend. It's Heather's
   B-Day. Will another weekend work?

   Sorry you and Barb broke up but se la vi-How the hell do you spell that
   french shit? Anyway there are other fish in the sea dude. Go for a
   twenty
   one year old so I can salivate.

   No Le Hace is scheduled for Aug 31. Mark your calendar.

   GT

   Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip
   next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be
   myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships
   seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am
   working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.
