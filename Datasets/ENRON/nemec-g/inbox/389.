Gerald-
I am forwarding this Riceland Petroleum Company confirm to you per Ellen W. as it needs extra legal language in it.  You should have Riceland's August confirms that Ellen has already sent you.  This confirm is for the month of September.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 
Thanks 
Richard
