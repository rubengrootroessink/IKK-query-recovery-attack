Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of "reinventing the wheel", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.
