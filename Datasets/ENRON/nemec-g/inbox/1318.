Hey Gerald,
Just wanted to let you know I have followed up with the past due amount of around $12,000.  I contacted both a/p departments; the invoice is currently still outstanding.  Angie from Katz Kutter is faxing me the detail.  I will bring it to your attention when I receive it in order to issue payment.  Thanks!
