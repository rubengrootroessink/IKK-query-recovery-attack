David/Richard:

I hope you had a good time on the hunt and made it home in time for the service.  We'll try to do another hunt behind dogs later in the season.  To follow up on our discussions with PNP, I have proposed a Letter Agreement which defines one basic structure for the deal.  This is definitely open to discussion and I would like your input.

When Richard visits tomorrow, I would like to review the pro forma we have developed for the transaction.  The pro forma is a work in process - but provides a good start on understanding the total project value as well as the return to each party.  If we can agree the basic structure of the deal, we then need to agree the commercial assumptions and how the revenue stream from the sale of oil and gas is to be provided.

After you have had a chance to review, I will arrange a visit to take any comments.

Regards,
Brian
