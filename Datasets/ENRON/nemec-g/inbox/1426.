I am also working on pulling information out of SAP and assisting with the ECS financial data since Karen is so involved in the monthly close as well as other requests.  I have to agree with Karen.  It is taking some time to search thru the data in SAP since some of the transactions were paid, received, recorded in ENA and we have to search thru the 1000's of transactions in ENA.  Also the files and records have not all been retrieved since essentially no financials have been prepared this year and anyone who worked on ECS in the past are gone.  I am trying to piece all of this together, unfortunately it will take a little time.  I can call Patty and discuss this with her and set her expectations for receiving the financial data as soon as we can pull the finacial data together next week.  I just think it needs to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible before it is sent.

Stuart,
The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.  

Karen

Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart
