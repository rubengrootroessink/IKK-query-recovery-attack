Gerald,

We are still waiting on our letter from the producer that cause us to Force Majeure Duke.  I will get it to you as soon as I get a copy.

Also, we had to claim Force Majeure on Enron North America. I assume we need to prepare a letter for them too? I have the letter from the producer on that one.

Let me know.

Judy
