The Anadarko project is located approx 3 mi due west of Carthage, TX  in Panola Co. 
The Duke project is located 2 mi NW of the town of Falfurrias in Jim Wells Co. TX

Both projects contemplate an eletrical drive retrofit of existing gas compression facilities. The Anadarko project is 12,000 Hp and the Duke project is 20,000 Hp. 

Let me know if you need any additional info. 

Thanks
