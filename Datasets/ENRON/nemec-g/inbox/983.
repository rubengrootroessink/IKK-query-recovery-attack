Gerald,

Here is another GTC Dedicated Reserves confirm that needs preparing. Here is the well information:

Field/County/State:	? /West Delta/Louisiana, Timbalier Bay/ LaFourche/Louisiana, ?/South Pass (South)/Louisiana
Well Name:		West Delta #35 Subsea, So Timbalier Bay 21, South Pass #78 Dehyd 
Meter No./Pipeline:	011413, 010442, 011492/ Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Working Interest:	100%

I am waiting on a call back with the field names for the West Delta and the South Pass wells.

Can we prepare the dedicated reserves confirms with just a delivery point or do we have to list all of the wells behind the delivery point?  

Thanks,
Judy
