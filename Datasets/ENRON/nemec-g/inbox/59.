	Judy, These deals were left off the original Exhibit A. Torch asked if we would also buy this gas for Oct. John Grass and Dayem agreed. I don't know if this
	constitues and addition to Exhibit.

George,

The audit on these two deals show that you entered the deals. Are these deals part of the overall Torch deal that was negotiated Oct - Mar '02?  I did not see the meter numbers on the original list of gas we were buying.

Judy,

I have taken care of the 56 torch deals (in dcaf)  + sent the executed copy to the file room.  This is the one associated with wellhead GTC's.

?  There are two other Torch Deals 1085947 and 1085978 for Oct 01 and I don't believe that these are associated with the above referenced deal, but could you check?  If they are not, should I confirm as normal?
