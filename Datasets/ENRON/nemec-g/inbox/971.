	Several agreements with PG&E entities as you might imagine, none with this particular entity - Old agreement  (12/99) with PG& E Corporation re ENA acquisition of PG&E affiliates PG&E Gas Transmission, Texas Corporation and its subsidiaries and PG&E Gas Transmission Teco, Inc. and its subsidiaries expires 12/2001 - contained a no-hire provision which expired 12/2000.

	Several with PG&E National Energy Group relating to purchase and/or sale of generating assets, but each is transaction specific and contains no restrictive provisions.
