Patrick,  

Which 2 acres is Bridgeline purchasing?  I have a Survey updated as of August 14, 2000 Listing  6 Parcels.  If you can point me to the relevant properties, I'll instruct Keith Daigle as to what we need in the way of a Deed transferring the relevant property to Bridgeline.

Thanks,

Steve
