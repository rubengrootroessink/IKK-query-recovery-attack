Mary,

Please give to Gerald Nemec.  One of Patrick Johnson's people has been trying to sell our interest.  I think Rhaki Israni or Brandie Morris.

Steve:  During a recent visit to AEP, Ann Elizabeth gave me a working file re Matagorda Terminal.  Do you know who is handling that matter in Legal now?  I want to be sure and pass the file along to the right person.  It's not being handled by Gerald.

Thank for thinking about this,
Mary
