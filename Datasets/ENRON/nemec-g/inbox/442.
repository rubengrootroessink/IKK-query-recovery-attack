Gerald,

Just to let you know, I scheduled a meeting with Roger Westbrook on this Thursday, Sept 27 at 2 pm.  If it's okay with you, we can just meet in your office at that time.

The two main issues to discuss are the plat and legal description for Sorrento and the Bridgeline-Crawfish agreement.

Please let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi
