Gerald,

Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT, just
lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to the
Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season is
shot.........

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.
