David, enclosed is an electronic copy of a "deficiency" letter pertaining
the storage permit application.  The deficiencies are minor in nature and
should be easy to remedy.

Robert Morgan and I met with Joe Ball yesterday and had a chance to discuss
the permit application.  The meeting was not planned, but it just so
happened that Joe had recently completed his review of the application.

We also discussed the timeline for a final order approving storage in the
cavern.  Assuming we can provide the information requested in the letter on
or before July 6, we can take the application to hearing on July 26.  After
the hearing there will be a 1 week post-hearing comment period (approx. Aug.
3).  Commissioner's proposed order and findings of fact should be complete
on Aug 10.  Within 7 days the commissioner should send proposed findings of
fact to Natural Resources Committee for review and comment (Aug 17).  The
order will likely be signed no later than the 1st week in September.  It is
possible that it could be as early as the last week in August.

I discussed with Joe Ball the issue of dewatering.  He again said that we
can begin dewatering anytime now upon notice the office of conservation.
Joe interprets the regs to allow us to take steps necessary to "convert" the
cavern from Brine to NG, but we cannot store NG without a permit.  Joe
considers dewatering to be part of the conversion process.

I would not recommend dewatering until we have provided Joe with the
information identified in the attached letter and he has set the matter for
public hearing (probably the first or second week in July).  Joe will not
set the matter for hearing until he considers the project to be technically
sound and in compliance with Statewide Order 29-M.  After Joe has "blessed"
this project, it is unlikely that we will have to do further sonar testing
(which I understand is difficult during dewatering).

Please call me at your convenience to discuss our response to the deficiency
letter.  504-584-9122.
