What do you have going on tonight?  We have a work happy hour at El Tiempo
tonight after work if you want to stop by.
...in answer to your previous question, i unfortunately cannot persue my
dreams of skid row and loose women - my guitar is acoustic, but i try.
it's much harder than it looks!

You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.  I
have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I should,
however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess, Heavy
Metal!

   Sounds cool.  My mom gave me her guitar a few months ago so I bought a
   fingering chart book (if that's what it's called - i don't know)
   yesterday.
   Learning guitar - This is my new project.  How long have you been
   playing?

   Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I stayed
   home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He plays
   the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at
   least
   we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
   furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda of
   sick
   of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
   pathetic
   when people visit.

   Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
   margarita
   though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

      Hey Gerald!!  The weekend was good.  I went to a wedding on Saturday,
      but I
      was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I finally went to
      Teala's (Houston's answer to Baby A's) for Ritas.  If you've never
   tried
      it
      - Mango would be my recommendation.  Sorry I missed you and your
   friends
      on
      Thursday.  I wimped out Thursday and Friday - pretty pathetic.  But I
      give
      you props just for considering GK 2 weeks in a row!!  Did you do
      anything
      fun?

      Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything exciting?  I
      was
      invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night, but I
   thought
      that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I begged off.
