Stacy: 
In a phone call this morning, the Palo Alto City Attorney's office had several comments and suggested revisions to the NGSA.  I have attempted to capture these few comments in the attached draft, which I am forwarding to you despite the fact that only a few pages are implicated (pages 4, 9, 10, 11, and 12, I believe).  We can discuss these changes when you are able to return my phone call. 
Also, can you confirm that PG&E's electronic bulletin board "Inside Tracc" is available to anyone with the appropriate software, and that no confidentiality agreements are needed to gain access?  This is what one of the utility folks at Palo Alto tells me. 
Talk to you soon.
