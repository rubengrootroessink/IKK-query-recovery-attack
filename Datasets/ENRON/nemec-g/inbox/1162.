We now have a fully executed Master Firm Purchase/Sale contract between ENA and ENA Upstream. I am forwarding the originals to Gerald Nemec, and he will get a copy sent to you. The confirmation language states that "Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties...or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties..." Therefore, per Gerald, we can discontinue preparing paper confirmations between the two Enron entities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Judy
