Steve, we may not need to have that meeting between ourselves and Bridgeline regarding the R/W, easements, etc on Crawfish property (at least not this week).  Roger Westbrook has been communicating directly with the Bridgeline R/W guy, and they have determined that they require the following items.  I appreciate your help (or Daigle's) in putting these together for execution.  Please communicate directly with Roger to acquire the appropriate descriptions.  

While we have Bridgeline's attention on this, let's try not to lose momentum.  Thanks for any pressure you can put on Daigle to get this done.

As far I know, BHLP needs the following documents from Enron for the
facilities at Crawfish.
	1)  Surface Easement for roughly 1acre OR Special Warranty Deed for Sale of roughly 2acres.
	2)  Surface Easement near River Road for existing facilities. 
(Parcel VI on Survey)(Equilon shared site).
	3)  Road Ingress/Egress (limestone road shown on Exhibit G.  Need Easement)
	4)  ROW easements for:
		A. 16" Pipeline (1609) going northeast from the surface
facilities to the river.
		B. 16" Pipeline (1609) going northwest from the surface
facilities to Taft (depends on land owned by Enron.  Not on Exhibit G).
		C. 16" Pipeline (1607) coming from the southwest, going to
the surface facilities (depends on land owned by Enron).
		D. Dual 16" Pipelines going northeast from Parcel VI across
the Mississippi River.
	5)  8" pipeline will be abandoned.  See detail on Exhibit G.  Bridgeline to determine if abandon in place or remove.
	6)  Abandon 3" and 16" pipelines.  See exhibit G.
	7)  Parcels III and IV on Exhibit G will be abandoned.

Bridgeline to furnish individual certified plats for each item 1 through 4 above.

I've asked Engineering to confirm the footprint needed for the new
tanks, then have it surveyed.  For the price that was mentioned, I
prefer to buy the land; but we need to finalize the details.  That needs
to be resolved before:
	- I can build the new tanks, 
	- we can finalize the ROW documents.   

Once you have reviewed this, please call me. I'm sure that both of us
would like to move forward.

Thanks.
