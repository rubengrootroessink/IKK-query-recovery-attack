Gerald,

There is a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 25 at 9 am to discuss, among other things, the hazardous waste issues at Assumption Parish with Kyle Purvis and David Owen.  Would you be able to make to the meeting for about 10-15 minutes to discuss this issue? 

Any changes on the chain of title issue for the Assumption Parish deal?

Rakhi
(x-3-7871)
