Dear U2.Com Member,

One year on from the launch of U2.Com, we're now delighted
to launch our interactive fan-based Zootopia pages. (It is
the one element site visitors have been asking for more than
any other).

As a registered member you can now trade views with fans
worldwide about U2 albums and tours, discuss other fan sites
or wrestle over the different political and social causes
the band support. You can also chat live. As Zootopia
develops we will introduce new boards in response to your
requests.

For a trial period, Zootopia is open only to people already
registered as U2.Com members, but within weeks it will be
accessible to everyone.

When you click this link http://www.u2.com/homepage/zootopia_disclaimer.html
you will open a disclaimer and if you agree to that you can
access the new interactive area.

You will need to log in with the e-mail address that this
mail is sent to and use the password zootopia. Once logged
on you can click the preferences button and complete
additional information and choose a username and change your
password.

In other U2.Com news, we have posted the US video for Stuck
In A Moment along with the band's performance at the Video
Music Awards. And there is still time for you to cast your
weight in favour of U2 - and U2.Com - in the MTC Europe
Awards, where the band have five nominations. Make your vote
count here - http://ema.mtv.co.uk/uk/content/voting.shtml

And don't forget, we are now carrying several new items of
clothing in the U2.Com shop, introduced especially for the
third leg of Elevation 2001. Check all the gear at
http://shop.u2.com/


Best wishes

U2.COM
