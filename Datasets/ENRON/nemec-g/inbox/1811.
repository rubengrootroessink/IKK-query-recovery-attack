Dear Fellow Diver;

Wow!  Since being mentioned in last months Fellow Diver newsletter, hundreds of you have downloaded PADI's  "Bring A Friend" offer from PADI ( http://www.padi.com/promo/poker/download.asp ) that pays you $50.00 just for getting three new people certified as PADI Open Water divers. I have also received hundreds of questions, so I thought I'd take a minute to answer the most frequently asked ones.  Here they are:

What's the catch?

There is none.  Honest. Just download the form and for every three divers you bring into a PADI Dive Center or Resort location who complete the PADI Open Water Diver course by February 28, 2002, I send you $50.00.  That's it!

If I get 6 people certified can I get $100.00?

Yes, just make copies of the form, and for every 3 new PADI Divers your bring in by February 28, 2002, I will send you $50.00.

Why is PADI doing this?

Actually, that's pretty simple to answer. PADI is trying to get more divers into the sport. It's not a secret that the dive industry's growth in the US has been flat over the last couple of years, so we're trying to "kick start" the industry with an outrageous offer. (See, I told you there wasn't a catch!)

I heard that some PADI facilities are offering additional incentives if I show them a copy of my PADI check. Are there other offers for getting new divers?

This is the best part of this whole program.  Within hours of PADI announcing the launch of this program,  we received inquiries from PADI Members and others in the industry who wanted to add additional incentives on top of the $50.00. The results have been amazing. Several dozen PADI Retailers have called or emailed to tell me about  their offers. These include:

Ocean Enterprises, CA; Ocean Divers, FL; Deep Six, FL; Bird's Underwater, FL; Ocean Odyssey, WA; A-1 Scuba, CO; Ocean Concepts, HI; Mass Diving, MA; Poseidon Adventures, DE; Annapolis Scuba, MD; Sport Chalet, CA; Divers Market, MA; Blue Horizons, PA; Aquatic Adventures, WI; Sea Side Dive, MI;  Blue Ocean, NY; Underwater Phantasea, CO; Underwater Connection, CO; Weavers Dive & Travel, Boulder, CO; Ocean's Window, TX; The Dive Spot, TX; A.K.A Diver, Arlington, TX;  El Mar Diving,  AZ; All Wet Scuba, AZ;, The Reef Diving Co., AZ;, We B Divin', TX;, Grapevine Scuba, TX; Hampton Dive Center, NY; and Aquatic Adventures, NY.

More PADI Dive Centers and Resorts are calling daily, so I apologize to those I've missed or inadvertently left off the list above.

Manufacturers have also stepped up to the plate and are in discussions with PADI to bring you more for your effort.  Scubapro immediately said it will issue a $25.00 rebate on Scubapro Twin Jet Fins to anyone who can show a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI as well as proof of purchase.  For details, please visit http://www.scubapro.com.

PADI resorts are stepping up to the plate, too.  Sunset House in Cayman is offering 10 percent off for anyone who shows a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI and books a stay there before March 1, 2002.  UNEXSO in the Bahamas has a $150.00 dollar offer for showing the PADI check and an additional $50.00 for every "Learn To Dive" customer you bring them.  For details on these offers go to  http://www.sunsethouse.com/ and  http://www.unexso.com.

I know you all hate long e-mails, but this has been truly incredible and there is still more good news coming.  Both Sport Diver magazine (http://www.sportdiver.com)  and Skin Diver magazine are working on additional incentives that I'm sure I'll be able to announce very soon. I also understand Seapro in Florida also has a program under development.

So, it's not just $50.00 anymore! Do this right and you can earn a heck of a lot more -- you ain't seen nothing yet.  So, what are you waiting for? Get three friends and go diving!

Brian
