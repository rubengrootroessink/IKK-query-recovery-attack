Dear Shane:  As you requested by voice mail message, attached is the electronic version of one of Sandi's TPAs that I copied and gave to Garrett as an example.  Please note that it is partially filled out with the "Sabine" counterparty, and that will need to be changed on all future documents arising out of this one.

Best wishes,
Mary
