Gerald,

I just finished visiting with Mark Knippa about Enron Compression Services.  It probably makes sense to get together with you and someone on the bankruptcy team to talk about how we should handle all of the deals in ECS.  Can we set something up for Wednesday?  I have asked Mark to put together deal structure charts and explanations so that we have something to present to the bankruptcy lawyers for consideration at this meeting.  I would ask that you work with him to verify the accuracy of those charts/explanations.

Stuart
