Gerald,

Here is a revised copy of the agreement.  I added some strong safety
language in Section 22 which I need you to look at.  Also, I don't see a
"Failure to Perform" provision - is this covered somewhere else?

Also want to discuss the Remedy in case of Default provisions.  I don't want
BCCKOP to be able to shut the facility down and hold us hostage for payment
of something.  I want them to be able to terminate the agreement, and then
orderly shutdown the facility and then leave.  Otherwise, we keep on
operating.  Let's discuss.  Also added words on Schedule F.



Ken Krisa
