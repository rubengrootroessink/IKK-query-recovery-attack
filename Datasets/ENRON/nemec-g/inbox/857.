G,

July is good. I am taking the first two weeks off in July so sometime during
that time would be good. We need to go tubing or something.

No George Jr. for a while. We know better than to be in hurry. Actually I
plan on being the father and grandfather of our kids. No incest, I just
going to be old enought to handle both duties. I figure it would save money.


Good to here your taking your time with Barbara. She needs to understand,
you're not in a hurry for a good reason. You know how women are, tick
tock,tick tock. Damn the clock pisses me off.

Did you go to China on purpose or did you miss a connection?

Sounds cool. We thought we had historic crap.

Let's get together dude.

GT

GT,  Hey guy I am doing good.  The casa made it through the floods with no
problem.  I was actually out of the country when all that occurred.  I just
got back from two weeks in China.  Very interesting.  Saw the Great Wall
and a whole lot of other things.  I am still seeing Barbara, the girl I
took to your wedding.  Things are going okay with that.  I am not very good
at the relationship thing right now and she gets frustrated with me.

How's the married life.  Thought there might be a George Jr. on the way by
now.

Yes,  I need to make a trip to Austin soon.  The next couple of weekends
are swamped, but maybe sometime in mid to late July.  What does your
Calender look like then?

   G,

   What's new dude. I haven't heard from you so I thought I'd bug ya. How's
   the
   casa/lovelife going. Did you get some water in the casa? You need to
   come to
   Austin with your clubs or swimming trunks. We could rent a ski boat or
   something.

   Hope you're doing well
   George T.
