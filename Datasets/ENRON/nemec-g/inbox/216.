Dear Shane:  Once you give me the fully-executed TPA, I make a file copy for our office and send the original to the Global Contracts group, along with a distribution worksheet that I fill out.  My contact at the Global Contracts group is Linda Bryan in EB 2128a.  I understand that EES contracts are handled by Colette Weinreich at ext. 57516.  

Best wishes,
Mary
