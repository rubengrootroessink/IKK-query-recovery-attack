President Bush has requested that Americans return to business in order to show the world that although saddened and angered by these senseless acts of terrorism, Americans are not beaten.  Accordingly, Prescott Legal Search is resuming recruiting efforts on behalf of our clients.  This return to business in no way diminishes the terrible tragedy that has befallen our nation, the victims and their families.  Thank you for your time and attention to this request.
