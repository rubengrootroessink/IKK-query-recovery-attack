Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

	The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
	Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
	Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.
