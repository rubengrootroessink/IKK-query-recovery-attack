Gerald,

Will you please make the pricing change when you are reviewing the confirm?

Thanks,
Judy

Judy, the confirm language looks good, but the price is wrong - should be Index less .0175 for the first 1700/d and  Gas Daily flat for gas over that amount each month. We can put a MDQ if you want to...but the only way we would have more gas is if they add another well and we could reject it I think if we wanted to based on it not being w/in the dedication......Do you want to talk more about that? Thanks.

Gerald,

Please review the attached completed confirmation for EEX E&P and forward to Ellen Wallumrod to send to the customer if you approve.  We need to get this to the customer today if at all possible.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.
