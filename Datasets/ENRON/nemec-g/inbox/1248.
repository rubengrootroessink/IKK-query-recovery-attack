Jay/Gerald,

This is an industrial customer I would like to sell gas to.  The deals will short term Spot transactions.  Can provide the proper clearance for short term trades.

Dear Paul,

I spoke to you about setting up a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement with
Holnam Cement, a direct connect end user on CIG at Portland Colorado.
Portland is located on the Canon City lateral on the CIG Valley Line.
Please verify that you have the ability to deliver gas at this location.
Then, please contact Jim Crain with Holnam to answer any creditworthiness
issues.  Jim can be reached by e-mail or by calling (719) 784-1102.

Please contact me and send any GISB Special Provisions required by Enron.

Holnam's primary fuel is coal.  Holnam will order spot gas on CIG when
starting up or shutting down its coal fuel and, if available, make spot
purchases as confirmed.  In August Holnam will need at least 75,000 Dth.  If
more is required it will be ordered.  Holnam will purchase the gas
"delivered" at Holnam or as directed by CIG for storage refill.  I will
supply you with the meter identity at Holnam when required.

Please respond immediately.  Thank you.		 Larry Campbell  (303) 239-1361
