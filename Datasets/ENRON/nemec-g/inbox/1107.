   The subject permit has been approved. Bridgeline may begin dewatering
   operations at any time. The approved permit number is 20672.  The
   hardcopy of the approved permit will be mailed to you this afternoon.
   The permit only approves dewatering of the cavern. It does not
approve
   gas storage.
