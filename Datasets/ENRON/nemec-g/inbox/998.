G - It seems like CSU is pretty set on using their paper.  Let me know what you think.

Tyrell, 

CSU is pretty picky about using our contracts for these deals.  There are several sections that we must have in a contract and those are all covered in our version.  Could you ask your legal if they could live with our contract?  If there is any language they would like to add, we can cover that ground as well.  Let me know if this will work for you.

Marcus,
Sorry for the delay . . . it's difficult to get folks moving during holiday
weeks.  Anyhow, our legal group has indicated that they would like to have
a Master Firm Agreement in place with CSU to which we can attach concise
Transaction Agreement Exhibits detailing specific deals.  I have attached
the Master Firm Agreement for your review and will follow shortly with the
Transaction Agreement Exhibit for our swing deal.

(See attached file: Colorado Springs Utilities.doc)

Please let me know your thoughts on the Master Firm and don't hesitate to
call with any questions, comments, and/or concerns.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison
