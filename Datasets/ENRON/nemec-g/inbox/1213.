Gerald,

I have reviewed the agreements.  I have only one question concerning "Variance From Nomination".  If the producer under delivers and I have to replace the gas should we use a keep whole.  I am not sure if this concern is covered under "2. Quantity Obligation"  Please let me know your thoughts.

thanks JJG

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.
