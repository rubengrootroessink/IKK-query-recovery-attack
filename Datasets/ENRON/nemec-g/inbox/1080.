Gerald,

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,

I believe this is the Confirmation, as prepared by Legal. Please follow up with Nelson to see if he sent it out and got an Executed copy back.

Many thanks,
Ellen
