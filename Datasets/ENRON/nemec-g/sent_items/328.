Attached is the executable Agency and Management Agreement Document.  Please print out and execute and fax back to Barry for ENA's execution.  We will fax back a fully executed copy.  Please note that as we discussed, two of the gentlemen listed in Mexicana  de Cobre's power of attorney must execute.  

Will will follow up with hardcopy orginals for execution with all the exhibits in the mail or delivered by Barry.  Thank You.
