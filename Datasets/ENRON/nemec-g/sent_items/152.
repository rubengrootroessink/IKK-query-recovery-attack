Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.  Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.  

Some items to note:

1.  As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at Enron.  The current Enron Corp. policy requires approvals by:
	1.  The President (or equivalent) of Enron North America Corp.
	2.  General Counsel of ENA (Mark Haedicke)
	3.  Executive VP, Corp. Development of Enron Corp.
	4.  Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.

2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.

I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.  Let's discuss.
