I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip?

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?
