Kyle,  Attached are the final versions of the Servitude Agreement and the Filing Form.  We made some changes to the form for consistency.  Please review.  

Roger and Rakhi, Please verify the legal description provided by Enterprise.  I also have a plat which I will forward to you for review.  After everyone has reviewed and approved we should be ready to go.
