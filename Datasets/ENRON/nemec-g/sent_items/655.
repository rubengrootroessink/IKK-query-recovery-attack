Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work, her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts, washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes, bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there. A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.

Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all she
does for you. You pay $50 per cleaning, don't you? Thanks! We will have to
get together this weekend.

Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The
GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.
They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the
end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.
Later.

   Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
   cleans
   your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we didn't
   show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun? Do
   you
   have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.

   jenn
