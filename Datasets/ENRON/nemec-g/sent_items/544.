There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.  There isn't too
much towards Enron.  I don't mind going towards your building.  You have
probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building. Good Italian.
There is also a Cafe Express down there. I am OK with any of those.  Do you
like Sushi?  There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center.

   I'm in Pennzoil at Louisiana and Rusk.  I usually meet my Enron friends
   at
   NY Pizzeria or Ninfas, but neither sound good this week.  Do you know
   any
   other good places in between?

   Still good for me.  How about we meet at 12:00.  Which building are you
   in?
   We can meet somewhere in between.

            You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring
      basics.
         I
            have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I
         should,
            however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover
   all
      my
            mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me
   guess,
         Heavy
            Metal!

               Sounds cool.  My mom gave me her guitar a few months ago so
   I
         bought
            a
               fingering chart book (if that's what it's called - i don't
      know)
               yesterday.
               Learning guitar - This is my new project.  How long have you
      been
               playing?

               Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt
   so
      I
            stayed
               home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends
   house.
      He
            plays
               the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session
      (or
         at
               least
               we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday
   I
         went
               furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I
   got
         kinda
            of
               sick
               of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't
   seem
      so
               pathetic
               when people visit.

               Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the
      mango
               margarita
               though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds
      fruity!!

                  Hey Gerald!!  The weekend was good.  I went to a wedding
   on
            Saturday,
                  but I
                  was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I
   finally
         went
            to
                  Teala's (Houston's answer to Baby A's) for Ritas.  If
   you've
         never
               tried
                  it
                  - Mango would be my recommendation.  Sorry I missed you
   and
         your
               friends
                  on
                  Thursday.  I wimped out Thursday and Friday - pretty
      pathetic.
            But I
                  give
                  you props just for considering GK 2 weeks in a row!!  Did
      you
         do

                  fun?

                  Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
         exciting?
            I
                  was
                  invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday
   night,
      but
         I
               thought
                  that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I
      begged
            off.
