Mary,  Can you prepare two separate CAs between Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Enron Compression Services Company.  You can use the bilateral form we normally use.  Rusk's information is 

Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc.
P.O. Box 1169
Henderson, Texas 75653-1169

The scope for the two CAs is as follows:

1.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at OGS Pipeline, L.L.C.'s Hinkle Compressor Station"

2.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at Anadarko Energy Services Company's Carthage Facility"

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help!
