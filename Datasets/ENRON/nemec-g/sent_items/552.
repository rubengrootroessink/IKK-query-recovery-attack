Mary,  Can you check to see if Jempy can sign for LRCI, Inc. and let Rakhi Israni know?  In the alternative, please provide her a copy of the corporate data sheet which list the VPs who can execute documents for LRCI.

Is Jempy Neyman authorized to sign for LRCI?  By the way, do you know if Keith Daigle has already sent the purchase agreement to the Parish?

The entity should be LRCI, Inc.  You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is a draft of the mowing letter for Assumption Parish.  Please review.  The address needs to be added in Exhibit A.  Let me know if you have any questions.
