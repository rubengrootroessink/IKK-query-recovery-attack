John,  Per our discussion, attached is a draft form of gathering agreement.  This form is a firm committed reserves gathering agreement. If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions.
