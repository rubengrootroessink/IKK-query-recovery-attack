Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.

Whatup Dog?  How is Enron treating you?  Still enjoying the legal side of
things?

Everything here is going well.  Marriage is still very good, even blissful.
Michigan has been great so far but I am still waiting for the weather to
turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

Rude-Dog

Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!
Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and
drink all that beer.

The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been
spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right
now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game
this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you
never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?
