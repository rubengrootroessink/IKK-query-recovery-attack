Team,
Attached is the latest term sheet.  I will add a few sentences on the liquidated damages pricing on Monday morning.  The text highlighted in blue are the latest material changes including an Exhibit.  The text in red is to be finalized items.

 << File: NNG Keystone Term Sheet (July 27).doc >> 
John Kiani is working on the valuation sensitivities.

Thanks, Lisa
