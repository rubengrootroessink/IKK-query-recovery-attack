Gerald,

Apparently there are some problems regarding cutting checks for some of the Kern producers.  As such, we have to switch the letters around to reflect wire transfers.  In the case of The pertinent information for the letters requiring revision is as follows:

1) Kennedy Oil
First Interstate Bank of Commerce
Gillette Branch
ABA# 102300129
Account# 362170342

2) J.M. Huber Corporation
ABA: 021000089
Acct: 00050892

3) Patina Oil & Gas Corporation
Wells Fargo Bank, Seattle
ABA: 121000248
Acct. 4296915515

4) FMI Weld
The only thing that needs to change is the account number.  The correct number is:
1018233241

The letters will have to reflect payment as of tomorrow.  I'll call you shortly to follow up.

Thanks.
