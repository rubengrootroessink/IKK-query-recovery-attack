Judy,  Attached is the Pioneer Confirm.  Please insert all the relevant contact information.  Also please carefully review the confirm to make sure that I interpreted your email info. correctly.  I left a blank for the Field information.  I would ask the counterparty to fill in and return a copy to ENA Upstream.
