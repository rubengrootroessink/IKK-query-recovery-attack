Hey Tracy,  Yes you are correct.  That is a fantastic picture of JJ.  Really miss that guy.  Young Frank doesn't seem to be enjoying the experience as much as Madeline.  Glad to hear things are going well for you guys.  All is good with me.  Not much new and exciting happening.  Thanks for the pics!

Hey Gerald!  I hope all is well.  The  Fillip family is doing fine.  Tom likes his new job at El Paso  Energy.  The kids are both going to school two mornings a week and I am  enjoying the break.  We are getting ready for Halloween, Madeline is going  to be a princess and Frank is going to be a cowboy.  We are also getting  ready for Frank's birthday party, he will be two next month.
 
Anyway, Cristi sent us some pictures from the  twins' birthday party. We knew you would enjoy this one of J.J.
 
I am also sending you a picture of Madeline and  Frank...there is a big difference between little girls and little girls as is  evident in their smiles.  Ha!
 
Enjoy!
 
Tracy
