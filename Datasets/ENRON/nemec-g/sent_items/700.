I am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.  

Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

Thanks,

Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,
Judy
