Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.   
 
 Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration.

The weekend was a blast.  I won $116 at the craps table (I'm addicted now and my dad thinks I need to join gamblers anonymous).  We kayaked on the Colorado River - about 11 miles - on Saturday and the weather was spectacular.  And we hiked the Grand Canyon on Sunday - an amazing site!  It reminded me of a spontaneous college road trip.  We had a lot of fun.  Let's talk about another football game in the future or go get drinks sometime.  
 
Have a good week!

I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip?

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?
