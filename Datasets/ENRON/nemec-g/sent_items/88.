Frank,  Sandi Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help.

Gerald:

I just spoke with Shane Lakho again regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA.  She said that it may have been your predecessor, Sandy Brayband(?), who was involved in this deal, but that the terms had been approved by ENA-Legal for ENA and ENA-Upstream.  Can you confirm this and let me know?  Thanks.
