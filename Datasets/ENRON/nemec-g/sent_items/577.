Jeff,  Attached is the letter with a few comments.  The only substantive comment concerns cost tracking.  We would like to be informed of the overall project costs as they are incurred.  Please see the attached redlined doc. with my comments.  Let me know if Gulf is OK with these changes.  We would like to get this finalized early tomorrow morning.  Thanks.

Here is my attempt at modifying the letter to conform to our discussions this afternoon.  The redline markings indicate changes to a clean version of the draft sent yesterday.  This draft incorporates a slightly modified version of the confidentiality statement you provided earlier today (changed Parties' to Party, etc.).  Please acknowledge receipt.
