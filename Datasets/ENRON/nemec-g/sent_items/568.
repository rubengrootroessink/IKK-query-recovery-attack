I will be glad to print this for you.  Do you want me to save the document and the revised document in a specific folder, or have you already done this?  Please advise.

Keegan,  Can you print the attached doc. on Enron Logo Only letterhead. This version had redlines, so you will need to accept the changes before printing.
