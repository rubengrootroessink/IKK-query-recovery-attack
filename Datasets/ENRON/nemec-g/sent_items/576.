The Parties shall keep the terms and provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential and shall not disclose them, in whole or in part without the written consent of the other Party.  If any Party shall be required by any court, legislative or administrative body to, whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, or some other processes, any Party shall have the full right and ability to disclose same without regard to the confidentiality covenant herein contained; provided, however, that such Party shall provide the other Parties with as much notice of its requirement to make such disclosure as is reasonably practicable and do all things that the other Parties may reasonably request, at the other Parties' cost, to facilitate the other Parties' efforts to eliminate or restrict such requirement.
