Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit under the physical agreement.  

At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 

Call if there are any questions.
