Sounds like you have been busy.  Work sucks.  Everybody is really stunned and depressed.  Plus, I have been sick since Sunday.  I have missed a couple of days of work.  Not a good week for the G.    Sorry to be such a bummer.  Anyway, glad that you like Lucinda.  She does good work.  We'll catch up this weekend.

Gerald, sorry I haven't replied back. It's my busy season at work. You know
she came last Saturday. She did an awesome job!!! Thank you so much for the
info. I was doing a volunteer home repair project, so I didn't get to meet
her. But, I'm sure next Saturday I will impress her with my expertise of
the Spanish language (like I impressed the citizens of  Spain, or at least
the people at Joy Enslava!)

How's work? I hope things start working out. Between you, my dad and many
others, a lot of money is being lost. Dad has to exercise 2,000 shares by
end of the year and another 3,000 in January. He's lost over a million
dollars! Hopefully, we can all get together this weekend and drink our
sorrows away!!! After all this time, I'm still waiting to get an offer from
the other side of the company. I think it's around the corner though. Talk
to you soon.

Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him
Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work,
her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she
comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts,
washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes,
bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband
speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want
to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If
she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and
take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on
the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there.
A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if
you have questions.

G

   Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all
   she
   does for you. You pay $50 per cleaning, don't you? Thanks! We will have
   to
   get together this weekend.

   Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.
   The
   GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis
   II.
   They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by
   the
   end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers
   again.
   Later.

      Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
      cleans
      your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we
   didn't
      show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun?
   Do
      you
      have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.

      jenn
