Sometimes you just have to step up to the big leagues.  I actually didn't know how much that trash can costs.  The ex bought it.  It is stainless steel, not chrome.
I will sell you mine for $90.  I will even Lysol it for you.


Congrats on your oversized chair with ottoman.

Are you retarded?  I went and prcied those trash cans yesterday and they are
$100.  Why would anyone need a $100 trash can?  Just kidding.

I am so very excited.  I bought a couch and a oversized chair with ottoman.
How exciting is that?

Needless to say, i did not buy your chrome trash can!
