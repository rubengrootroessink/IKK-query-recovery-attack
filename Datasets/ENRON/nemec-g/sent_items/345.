Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin?

Dave  and Gerald,
 
I just  wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give you any  problems?  I hope all is well.
 
Thanks,
