Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out.

Gerald,

If you are ok with this, would you please put together executable copies for us to sign and get to Ormat.  If not, let me know.

Chris,
The CA looks okay.  I made one change in para 4 that requires Enron to identify and mark the confidential information sent to Ormat.  I presume that not ALL correspondence between us will have to do with structured horsepower transactions.

See attached.

Hank

Hank,

You will find attached a confidentiality agreement as discussed for your
review.  We will call you early next week to discuss the potential
Transwestern deal further.  Have a good weekend.
