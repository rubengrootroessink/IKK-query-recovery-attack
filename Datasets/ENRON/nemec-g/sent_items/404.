Gerald,
 
We would like to put in place a bilateral confidentially agreement between ECS and Ormat to discuss our Structured Horsepower Concept. In the near future, we would like to amend this agreement to discuss specific deals with Ormat that we are considering. The information for Ormat is below.

Thanks, 
Peter
