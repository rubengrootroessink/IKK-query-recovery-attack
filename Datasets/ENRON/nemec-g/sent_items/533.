Here is the revised draft with ENA Upstream Company, LLC added to the guaranty.  Gerald would you be the one to describe the transactions in the "Whereas" clauses for this entity?

Brent, 
Everything looks fine from Credit's standpoint, but I forgot to mention one Enron Entity. Please add ENA Upstream Company, LLC to the list of companies covered. This entity will transact Physical Natural Gas, possibly with all 3 Duke Entities. Sorry about any confusion that this might cause.

At your request I have attempted to put together a format for the Enron Corp. Guaranty covering multiple Enron Entities and three Duke entities for financial gas, physical gas and other products to be defined.  When we have finalized what we want this form to look like I will create the corresponding Duke Guaranty.  

Darren, do we have any outstanding Enron Corp. Guaranties that this guaranty will supercede?

John and Jeff, can you fill in the descriptive "Whereas" clauses relating to the Enron entities and products that you handle?  Please call me if you have any questions on what we are trying to do with this document.

Brent,
I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and "encouraged," but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.
