Dave,  Per Barry's request, attached is our firm GTC and confirm for gas purchase/sale.  The GTC is typically only for deal which are 6 months or less.  Credit also need to review the counterparty.  Depending on the circumstances, a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement may need to be put into place.  Let me know if you would like a copy of the master.
