Hey Sam,  Actually it comes out every weekend as much as I try to control it.  I had a great time.  We will have to do that again sometime!

In addition to the previous email that I sent to the group, you all know that as the "sole survivors" of Friday night, I had to send you a separate email:

Mike: Thank you, thank you, and thank you? for your wisdom, encouragement, and especially for letting me out of having to "wax on - wax off."

Coralina (the "Closer") Rivera:  Call me, we must go dancing again.

Gerald:  It was fun to see the party animal side to you, I knew you had it in you despite your conservative office demeanor.

John:  It is your pool table now? "TH--WACK!"

Stephen:  We are forever in your debt for introducing the Gallant Knight to us.


Keep in touch,
Sam
