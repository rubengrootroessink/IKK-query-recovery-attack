Ken,  We are in receipt of your revised sale form.  We will review.  I also need the following items by today to fully complete my review.

1.  Any comments you have to the restriction language I proposed.
2.  Draft of the Board Resolution you added to the Act of Sale.
3.  Any other comments you have.

Please forward this information ASAP.
