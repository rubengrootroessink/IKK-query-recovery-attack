Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.  They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.  Later.

Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who cleans
your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we didn't
show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun? Do you
have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.
