Brucie,  You weren't supposed to tell anybody about that!!  Maureen,  I am planning on setting up a rental car for Janel and myself and we can cut you in on that action.  Our flight leaves Myrtle Beach at 11:40 on Sunday so if you are leaving out of Myrtle Beach that might work for you also.

Gerald calls me Brucie all the time too; it's my nickname.  He gets G-money and I get Brucie.  Those are our gang names.

I can't believe someone else calls you Brucie!

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Good Morning Brucie! I have a quick question, do you know if anyone is arriving in Myrtle Beach on Friday around 4:30? If anyone arrives around that time, maybe we can share a ride somehow. Vicki and Dennis are flying into Charleston the night before and offered to pick me up on the way but I don't want to incovienice them if I don't have to. Have a good day, Maureen
