Fred! 

The attached document reflects the comments of my legal group to the
guaranty language provided on behalf of Burlington Resource Trading,
Inc.  He was unable to redline the document, however his comments are
incorporated in the attachment.

As discussed we are interested in a $1.5MM guaranty to cover our 60 days
receivables.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Rudwell
