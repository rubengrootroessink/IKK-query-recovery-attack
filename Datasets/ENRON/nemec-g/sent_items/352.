Per my previous voice mail, could you please prepare CA's for both:  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation,  1200 Timberloch Place, The Woodlands, TX  77251 and Duke Energy Field Services,  5718 Westheimer, Ste 2000, Houston, TX 77057. As mentioned both CA's are for the purposes of data sharing relative to Elec. compression projects.
