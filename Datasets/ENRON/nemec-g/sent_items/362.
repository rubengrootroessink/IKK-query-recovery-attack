FYI,  Attached is the form of lease agreement that Hanover has forwarded for our lease of the compression equipment from Hanover on the Oakhill deal.  This is actually GE Capital's form of lease agreement, but would be executed between Hanover and Enron Compression Services Company.  Please review and provide any comments you may have.

	Gerald,
	
	Dave Gutierrez with Hanover has provided the following template agreements.
	Apparently Hanover's methodology for this Operating Lease takes the investment
	of equipment, packaging and installation to GE Capital for the resulting Operating
	Lease structure.
