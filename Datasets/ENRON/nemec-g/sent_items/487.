 Gerald,

I am so sorry, I honestly forgot about lunch. No excuses on my part, I feel
soooo bad. If you two are not totally mad at me, then perhaps, we can really
have lunch again on me. I feel like an idiot. I hope you and Debra will
forgive me. Tell Debra I apologize for missing lunch. I will e-mail her
myself. Anyway, e-mail me back please to let me know.

Sorry,

Majed

Where were you?  We waited and waited.  Debra says that you owe her two
lunches now!

   Let's plan on Wednesday.  How about we meet at Treebeard's in the
tunnel
   around 12.  Let me know if that works for you.  If you are not a fan
of
   Treebeards we can do something else.

       Tuesday is fine with me, or in the alternative, Wed. is also
fine.
   Just
      let
      me know Gerald, since I know you might have lunch plans with one
of
   your
      girlfriends j/k.

      Talk to you soon,

      Majed

      No problem.  I will just destroy the direct deposit slip.  Good
luck
      with
      the write on competition.  Lunch sounds great.  This week is kind
of
      busy
      but maybe next week.  Tuesday or Wednesday?  Yes, I guess we can
   allow
      Debra to go with us.

      Gerald

         Gerald,

         I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding
the
      message
         you
         left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition
   for
      law
         review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
      deposit,
         so
         I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new
clerk?
   I
         hope
         all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch
so
   we
      can
         all
         go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want
to
   say
         that it
         was great working with you. Write back soon.

         Best Regards,

         Majed Nachawati
