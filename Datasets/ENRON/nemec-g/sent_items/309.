Heather,  Attached are the clean and redlined drafts of the revised Coal and Ash Agreements per your notes and phone mail.  Please review.   By copy of this email I am asking David to review the insurance section in both agreements for adequacy.  

David - The attached are the forms of Coal Hauling and Ash Handling agreement that we would use to contract with Reuse Technology for both the Lumberton Power LLC and Elizabethtown Power LLC.  Please provide comments.
