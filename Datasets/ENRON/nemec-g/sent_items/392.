Hey Dan,  Good to hear from you.  I am doing fine. Sounds like fun.  I will try to make it.  I might get caught up here at work though.  I am leaving the country on Thursday for 4 days, so I am trying to tie up some loose ends here.  All my stripper friends are not returning my calls for some reason!  Hmmph!!.

Hey Gerald,
How you doing.  Gayle and I are having everyone over
for burgers and dogs on the 4th at around 1:30 pm.
We'd sure like you to come if you can.  Beers will be
furnished.  You don't have to bring anything (well,
may be a stripper friend of yours who has loose morals
would be o.k.)  Really, we'd like you to come.  Feel
free to bring a friend if you wish.

Let us know.

Look forward to seeing you....Dan
