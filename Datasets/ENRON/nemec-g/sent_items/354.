Mary,  Attached is further detail for the project descriptions for the two CAs I requested.  Please revise the CA to read "information in connection with sharing data relative to a potential electric compression project located approximately 3 miles west of Carthage, Texas in Panola, County".  Follow that form with the Duke CA as well.  Please prepare two executables of each.  Thanks for all your help.

The Anadarko project is located approx 3 mi due west of Carthage, TX  in Panola Co. 
The Duke project is located 2 mi NW of the town of Falfurrias in Jim Wells Co. TX

Both projects contemplate an eletrical drive retrofit of existing gas compression facilities. The Anadarko project is 12,000 Hp and the Duke project is 20,000 Hp. 

Let me know if you need any additional info. 

Thanks

As mentioned both CA's are for the purposes of data sharing relative to Elec. compression projects.
