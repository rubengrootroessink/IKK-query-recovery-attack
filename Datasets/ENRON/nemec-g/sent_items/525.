 Dear Debra and Gerald,

Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could pick
you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in downtown(they
have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch, so if
your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

Best Regards,

Majed Nachawati

    Dear Debra,

   I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for
lunch.
   I
   feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was
   interviewing
   for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town on
   Thursday
   of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me know.
I
   want
   you to fill me in on how you have been.

   Your law clerk,

   Majed Nachawati
