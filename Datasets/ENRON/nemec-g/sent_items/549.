Gerald this looks fine to me. Do you have any objections to sending  this out as a draft and we can get them to change the legal name if necessary at that time? Everything I have seen just says Illinois Power.

Attached is a draft of the CA.  Please review.  I need the full legal name of Illinois Power.
