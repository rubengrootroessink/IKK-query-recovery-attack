Adjusted purchase price s/b $209,159,347.
Build up of this number is
$204,000,000 purchase
+$4,000,705 estimated true-up
+$1,158,642 Friday final settlement

Number does not include the estimated 109K due from Westport.

The Payment schedule goes like this

NBP owes $1,158,642 through the true-up
ENA owes $1,937,200 throught the exec contract

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.  
Thanks.
