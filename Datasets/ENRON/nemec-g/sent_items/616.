Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Service=
s Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas u=
nder its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company=
.  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS deli=
very of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA und=
er a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been d=
esperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipe=
line worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Mark=
eting, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in =
the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,00=
0 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a l=
ong term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (appro=
ximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a =
potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide=
 any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the cur=
rent situation.
