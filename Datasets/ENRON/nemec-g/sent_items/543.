He called today and left the following message:

"He would like to know if you were able to square away Enron Corporate Representatives for depositions on September 10, 11, 12.  He would agree to do these by phone."

Phone is better than in person. Easier to cut off offensive inquiry. What do you think about making someone available in Houston?

In the meantime, I'll try to get more information about questions he would like to ask. I doubt that I will have any success in that effort.
