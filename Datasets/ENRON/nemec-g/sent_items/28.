Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Keith

es may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the powe=
r to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitrat=
ion shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties s=
hall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such =
equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under=

arty may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respec=

greement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Pro=
perty.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations=
