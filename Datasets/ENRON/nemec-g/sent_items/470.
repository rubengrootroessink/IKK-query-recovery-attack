Gerald,
FYI - The paragraph on Firm Transportation Backhaul was revised, to include secondary rights and tiered pricing, and the Interruptible Transportation Forwardhaul was deleted.  Exhibit II was revised and Exhibit III was deleted as well.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Team, 
Attached is the final Keystone Term Sheet proposal to Northern Natural Gas.  NNG is still in the process of having the CA signed.  As soon as the CA is signed by NNG (Tuesday at the earliest), the attached Term Sheet will be delivered to NNG by Ned Higgins.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
