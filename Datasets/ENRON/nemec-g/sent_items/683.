Robert,  The original contribution agreement called for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. to acquire consent for these assignments.  They were required to use "all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents".  To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.  I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.  What is the current status of this $25,000 per month bill.  Has Bridgeline invoiced us?

Attached are the consent to assignment letters. We will need two executables of each.  Let me know if you will be the one sending these out for execution.

What is the status on the assignment letters assigning the LGS Natural Gas Co. and Entergy New Orleans contracts to Bridgeline?
