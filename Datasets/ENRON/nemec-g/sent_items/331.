We have accepted your suggested revision to Article 13 of the Agency and Management Agreement.  Attached is a new executable with the language revised.   Also attached for execution are the gas purchase confirm and associated GTC for the gas purchase through Monday June 4.  The GTC was revised to remove the $0.15 per MMBtu liquidated damages.  Thanks.
