Debra,  I think we were waiting on credit for this one.  I believe we answered their question that Atmos Energy Corp. would be the one executing the documents.  Can you check with Veronica?

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost
over and we still do not have any contracts executed.  Hope you can get this
thing unstruck and moving forward again.
