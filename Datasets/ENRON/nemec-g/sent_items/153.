Hi Mom,  I am doing fine.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier.  Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.  I am staying busy with the usual stuff.  Talked to Sharon last week.  It sounds like she is getting really close to the time.  Another grandchild.  Are ya'll going up to Dallas shortly after the birth?

Just touching base to see if you are doing o.k. I called and left a message
and I also sent an e-mail to your house. We are just sorta antsy since all
this happened. Dad and I send our love. We love you a bunch. MOM
