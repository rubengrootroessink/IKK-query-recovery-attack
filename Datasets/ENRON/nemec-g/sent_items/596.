Dear Fellow Diver:

Well, it's been a while, but we have been busy.  Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening.  In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program.  Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm

Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA.  They were signing autographs and having a great time.  Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals.  It was great.

By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI.  I'm happy to report that the program is a big success!  The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check.  We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed.  Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters.

I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society.  Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver

The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us.  So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family?  Here is an idea.  We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website.  One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course.  Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI.  Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2  And don't forget to wish them happy holidays.  It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing.

If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle.  "She" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event.  Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home.

If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it!  Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week.  Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event.  Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available.

I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.
