Hi Gerald:  We have  executed agreements  with Amoco Corp. and several 
affiliates relating to everything from possible purchase of Amoco Gas Company 
to producer financing of purchase of some of their assets.  One between HPL/ 
Amoco Production Company relates to evaluation of Tyler Field.  None have 
restrictive provisions that would preclude another agreement to the best of 
my knowledge.  Let me know if you would like to see any of them or you are 
welcome to come and browse.

Kay
