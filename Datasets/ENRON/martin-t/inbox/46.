When it comes to Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron Chief Financial Officer=
, there's one thing those who worked with him agree on: He never appeared a=
nything but supremely self-confident. Early in his career at Enron, when Fa=
stow was just another bright young executive at the energy company, he barg=
ained relentlessly to win a concession from a banker. Afterward, Fastow tha=
nked him and said: ``I'll remember that when I'm CFO.''=20
Now, some see Fastow's cockiness as one factor behind Enron's collapse into=
 the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Certainly he wasn't the only top e=
xecutive at Enron with that kind of attitude; the word most people use to d=
escribe the company culture is arrogant. But Fastow was one of the few whos=
e aggressive tactics and overconfidence had the capacity to turn dangerous =
for the company.
If former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling was the architect behind Enron's transfor=
mation from stodgy pipeline to high-tech trading powerhouse, Fastow was the=
 trusted lieutenant who created the increasingly complex and unusual off-ba=
lance-sheet financing that fueled Enron's growth. He was also key in sellin=
g the deals to banks and institutional investors--sometimes with veiled thr=
eats and sometimes with sweet talk, say those familiar with his tactics. ``=
He had a dual personality. He could be charming but he could also be irrati=
onally mean,'' says one high-ranking insider.=20
As congressional investigators, the Securities & Exchange Commission, the J=
ustice Dept., and shareholders' lawyers try to pin down the culprits in Enr=
on's demise, Fastow, 40, has fast become one of the primary targets. He dev=
ised the LJM partnerships that triggered the controversy over Enron's accou=
nting. His lawyers stress that the LJM partnerships, which Fastow ran and h=
ad stakes in, were approved by top management and the board. They also note=
 that Fastow had no oversight of the accounting for these deals--that was t=
he responsibility of another Enron executive who did not report to him. Fas=
tow spokesman Gordon G. Andrew says that ``Enron senior management had full=
 knowledge of the LJM transactions.'' But some former and current Enron exe=
cutives believe that Fastow may have hidden some aspects of the partnership=
s--including the involvement of other insiders--from Chairman Kenneth L. La=
y and Skilling.=20
To many colleagues and bankers who knew him, it is easy to draw Fastow as o=
ne of the villains in this story. Insiders saw him as sometimes volatile an=
d vindictive, determined to get to the top by pleasing Skilling. That meant=
 putting together creative financial structures that ensured Enron could ex=
pand its business without adding too much new debt to the balance sheet or =
threatening its crucial credit rating. But Fastow's desire to follow Skilli=
ng's lead didn't end there. To build his new home in the exclusive River Oa=
ks section of Houston--where construction continues despite Fastow's troubl=
es--he hired the same architect Skilling had used, says a source familiar w=
ith the project. Some at Enron even came to believe that Fastow named his f=
irst son, Jeffrey, after Skilling--a contention denied by Fastow's wife thr=
ough a friend. ``I don't think Andy ever did anything that Jeff didn't tell=
 him to do,'' says one former co-worker. Adds another high-level insider: `=
`He wanted to make Jeff happy.''=20
Former colleagues say Fastow's screaming, table-pounding style suited the a=
ggressive Skilling. And Fastow's penchant for belittling co-workers certain=
ly didn't hinder his climb to the top. ``He loved to make people look stupi=
d,'' says one Enron executive. ``He seemed to do it most when he was in fro=
nt of a lot of people.'' Some former co-workers say he often remembered per=
sonal slights or grudges when it came time for performance reviews; at Enro=
n, the top managers could offer their evaluations of anyone, even those who=
 didn't report to them.=20
The aggressiveness was all in service to Skilling's plan to transform Enron=
 into a fast-growth, technology-oriented trading company: the company of th=
e future. When Fastow joined Enron's finance group in 1990, the company, an=
d the energy industry in general, were still considered backwaters for brig=
ht young MBAs. Skilling was determined to change all that; even then he was=
 pushing Enron to take advantage of the newly deregulated energy business. =
Fastow clearly sensed opportunity. And his wife Lea hailed from the wealthy=
 Weingarten realty and grocery family in Houston, so he was eager to move t=
o Enron's hometown. Lea, an MBA who had also worked at Continental Illinois=
 Bank in Chicago, joined Enron, too, in the treasury department. She left t=
he company in early 1997.=20
Fastow and Skilling quickly became partners in the effort to reshape Enron,=
 and Skilling looked to Fastow to help develop the financing that would fue=
l the growth of his empire. At first, the off-balance-sheet financings crea=
ted by Fastow and his group were not particularly risky, say bankers famili=
ar with the deals. Early ones were backed by payments from oil and gas prod=
ucers. But before too long, they say, Enron began using its growing clout t=
o include in the deals a hodgepodge of assets, some of dubious quality, and=
 a range of unusual provisions. One banker recalls a partnership that had v=
ery few restrictions on what energy assets Enron could put in; his bank eve=
ntually started turning some of the deals down. Another banker was stunned =
by an on-balance-sheet financing that was to be backed up by third-party re=
ceivables. The problem was that Enron also included the right to replace th=
e receivables with its own paper, which is now almost worthless. That deal =
was code-named Tammy, after Tammy Faye Bakker, and included her picture on =
the tombstone presented to participating bankers. As the banker recalls: ``=
I said, `Is it that ugly?'''=20
So why did so many bankers go along? Most didn't want to miss the Enron gra=
vy train. One Houston banker estimates that Fastow controlled some $80 mill=
ion to $100 million in annual fees for a wide variety of banking and invest=
ment banking services. Reluctance to join an Enron deal or persistent quest=
ioning about the terms would lead to threats that they'd be cut out of futu=
re business, some bankers say. To help in its arm-twisting, Enron kept an i=
nternal spreadsheet listing which banks were in which deals and what they m=
ade. Fastow and his team would also sell their deals by hinting that even t=
hese off-balance-sheet structures were somehow backed up by Enron, says one=
 former banker who did business with the company. And Fastow could also tur=
n on the charm: He delivered flowers to the house of one banker after his s=
on's baptism. Fastow's spokesman denies that he ever threatened bankers to =
get them into Enron's deals.=20
Fastow's hard-nosed business style doesn't square with the Andy that friend=
s and acquaintances saw outside of the office. He was a major benefactor to=
 the city's art museums, a fund-raiser for the local Holocaust Museum, and =
a co-founder of a synagogue. ``The Andy Fastow I know is one of the most th=
oughtful and generous people in Houston,'' says Robert E. Lapin, an attorne=
y who is one of Fastow's closest friends. When one of Lapin's three childre=
n was diagnosed with a rare disease, Fastow was one of the first to call. `=
`He said, `You just tell me when and how you need help and I'll do it,''' s=
ays Lapin. Even old chums from New Providence (N.J.) High School recall Fas=
tow as popular and well-liked, though extremely ambitious. He was the first=
 permanent student representative to the New Jersey State Board of Educatio=
n, for instance, a post he pushed to create.=20
Now as friends and colleagues try to figure out how Fastow landed in the mi=
ddle of one of the biggest financial scandals ever, that driving ambition i=
s looking more and more like a liability.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal: INVESTIGATIONS
THE SWAMP FOX ON ENRON'S TAIL Is Billy Tauzin--a longtime accounting-indust=
ry pal--the right man to lead the Hill's charge?
By Dan Carney and Laura Cohn in Washington, D.C.

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the affable Republican chairman of th=
e House Energy & Commerce Committee, once observed of his home state of Lou=
isiana that ``half of it is underwater. And the other half is under indictm=
ent.'' That pretty much sums up Tauzin: wickedly funny, disarmingly candid,=
 and--given some of the politicians Louisiana has produced--painfully on th=
e mark.=20
Sometimes called the Cagey Cajun or the Swamp Fox for his droll humor and d=
eft politics, Tauzin is a master at using his committee to full effect. Whi=
le he's leading just one of 10 groups looking into the Enron Corp. mess, co=
unt on him to be at the center of the action as the investigations heat up.=
 Thanks to his early acquisition of documents and digging, much of what has=
 come to light in recent weeks--including the letter that Enron executive S=
herron S. Watkins wrote last August to CEO Kenneth L. Lay warning of the co=
mpany's impending collapse--has come from his team of 15 investigators.
The Enron probe won't be the first controversy to put Tauzin in the spotlig=
ht. Many of the highest profile congressional hearings of the past 18 month=
s have been his doing. Remember the Ford-Firestone probe? That was his. The=
 hearings into the election-night network-TV projections in Florida? Tauzin=
 again. The California energy crisis? He was in the middle of that investig=
ation, too. The explanation for his frequent forays? It's partly due to his=
 committee's jurisdiction--and partly his own desire to be the showman.=20
But Enron clearly puts Tauzin in an uncomfortable position. As he doggedly =
pursues the hottest story in business, the southern Louisiana lawyer has ha=
d to do a little backtracking of his own. Until now, he has been one of the=
 most unabashed defenders of the accounting industry in Congress. He took $=
57,000 in campaign contributions from accounting firm Arthur Andersen over =
the past 12 years, more than any other House member. What's more, he was in=
strumental in defeating former Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Ar=
thur Levitt Jr.'s efforts to clamp down on accounting industry conflicts of=
 interest in late 2000. ``Today,'' he says rather sheepishly, ``it's kind o=
f hard to say there isn't evidence of a problem.Arthur Levitt was right.''=
=20
It isn't the first time that Tauzin has dramatically reversed his position.=
 Colleagues--some admiringly, some not--call him Congress' ``ultimate polit=
ical chameleon.'' Indeed, the Cagey Cajun has changed his political stripes=
 before, with no ill consequences. After the GOP took control of the House =
in 1995, he not only switched parties but also negotiated his way into a po=
werful subcommittee chairmanship. In one quick move, he managed to stay in =
the majority and cut in front of several lifelong Republicans to head the p=
anel that oversees telecommunications.=20
Tauzin's change of tune in the current controversy could have profound poli=
cy consequences. Once a staunch deregulator, he now vows a thorough look at=
 how Big Business conducts itself. ``We're finding out that there are real =
problems endemic in the structure of Corporate America that we need to deal=
 with,'' he told BusinessWeek. ``Enron is just the worst example.''=20
But can someone who has reversed positions and been closely tied to the acc=
ounting business convince the public that he is earnest in his efforts to p=
olice it? Many believe that while Tauzin is brilliant at political theater,=
 he's unlikely to go to the mat for tough new accounting rules. ``Things li=
ke this make good television,'' says Bill Allison, managing editor of publi=
cations for the consumer watchdog group Center for Public Integrity. ``But =
I don't know that they're going to make good law.'' Furthermore, some criti=
cs observe that while Tauzin's talk is now tougher, he has no intention of =
giving back any of the industry donations he has received.=20
Even so, voters back home give the congressman a lot of maneuvering room. H=
e's adored in his district along the Mississippi Delta for his panache and =
his help for local business. As a result, he has run unopposed in most of h=
is recent reelection races, as a Democrat or a Republican. Besides, as form=
er Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) says: ``Consistency is the hobgoblin=
 of small minds. And Tauzin does not have a small mind.''=20
Indeed, he's hoping to use those smarts to prove doubters wrong. Already, c=
ommittee staffers have interviewed former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling; Da=
vid B. Duncan, the recently-fired Andersen partner who handled the Enron ac=
count; as well as that firm's risk-management chief, Michael C. Odom. Tauzi=
n is also negotiating to meet with former Enron Chief Financial Officer And=
rew S. Fastow, who managed and had stakes in some of the risky partnerships=
 that caused the company to crater.=20
But there is the potential for disappointment, too. He has set the stage fo=
r his own high-profile hearings by selectively releasing some of the tens o=
f thousands of pages of Enron and Andersen documents his staffers have cull=
ed through, and his new challenge will be to deliver something more than he=
adlines. Moreover, Tauzin must also take care not to do anything that would=
 undercut the criminal probes undertaken by the Justice Dept.=20
For now, though, Tauzin is playing it cool. While his staff was hunting thr=
ough records over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, he was chasin=
g deer in Alabama and keeping in touch with his crew via BlackBerry. ``He m=
ay be hunting deer,'' one staffer laughed, ``but he's got his dogs hunting =
Enron.'' After the upcoming hearings, Tauzin may have some more headlines f=
or his scrapbook.

Tauzin's Scorecard
His earlier hearings generated headlines, but only modest action
FORD-FIRESTONE
Televised hearings examined tire blowouts and Ford Explorer rollover proble=
ms.
RESULT: A bit of money for oversight agency and modest new tire-safety
legislation, but no sweeping reforms.
ELECTION-NIGHT COVERAGE
Headed inquiry into how cable and networks bungled vote tally.
RESULT: Nothing.
CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS
Ran probe of brownouts and price spikes in 2000.
RESULT: Tauzin championed the Bush energy bill through the House, but it's =
now
bogged down in the Senate. Meanwhile California's problems have gone away o=
n
their own.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal
BRACING FOR A BACKLASH After Enron, business may be subjected to a new wave=
 of regulation

During the 1990s boom, Americans had mixed views about the world of busines=
s. Most applauded the bounty produced by the U.S. economy, support for dere=
gulation was on the upswing, and many rushed to grab a slice of the pie by =
investing in the rising stock market. For many, business simply became cool=
. Yet even with the bull market and the New Economy in full swing, a backla=
sh began to build as many also grew angry at the perceived high-handedness =
of big corporations: the uncaring HMOs, the lousy airline and telephone ser=
vice, the price-gouging drugmakers, and the sweatshops run by shoe and garm=
ent makers.=20
Now the Enron Corp. scandal--coming on the heels of a sharp recession, a tu=
mbling market, and an extended stretch during which many of the most vaunte=
d business success stories of the late 1990s proved to be chimeras--threate=
ns to push the anticorporate button all over again. True, two-thirds of Ame=
ricans still think corporations make good products and compete well in the =
global economy, according to a BusinessWeek/Harris poll taken Jan. 16-21. O=
nly a third, however, feel large companies have ethical business practices =
and just 26% believe they are straightforward and honest in their dealings =
with consumers and employees. ``The backlash is beginning,'' warned General=
 Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey R. Immelt at a talk with BusinessWeek=
 Editor-in-Chief Stephen B. Shepard in New York on Jan. 15. ``Credibility a=
nd trust is everything [in business]. And because of the recession, because=
 of Enron, that trust has evaporated.''
Will the public mood become increasingly at odds with big business and the =
culture of investing? Certainly, what's emerging is a political climate tha=
t appears much more open to government regulation than has been the case fo=
r years. A crackdown on the accounting industry seems likely. Board directo=
rs may get hit with new rules about conflict of interest, as well as new re=
sponsibilities to oversee corporate audits. Companies also could face restr=
ictions on the ability to fund 401(k)s with their own stock. ``I worry that=
 Enron will unleash a welter of restrictive new regulations,'' frets Steven=
 A. Raymund, CEO of Tech Data Corp., a Clearwater (Fla.)-based computer dis=
tributor.=20
Even campaign-finance reform could get a lift. After all, Enron's largesse =
with elected officials has left a widespread impression that it paid the co=
ps on its beat to take a nap. ``The Enron scandal clearly shows that legisl=
ators were influenced by campaign donations and didn't live up to their wat=
chdog duties,'' says David Clay, a veteran factory hand at Boeing Co.'s air=
craft plant in Everett, Wash.=20
Of course, public anger and political furor often have a way of fading quic=
kly in Washington. Gun control looked like a no-brainer after the Columbine=
 shootings, but wound up blocked by powerful groups such as the National Ri=
fle Assn. Corporate lobbyists are already working hard to head off Enron-re=
lated regulation. The heat also is unlikely to affect many of the broader d=
eregulatory efforts that have brought sweeping change to industries such as=
 banking and telecommunications.=20
Clearly there are signs of a growing disenchantment with business. While th=
e BusinessWeek/Harris poll shows that a core 16% of Americans have ``a grea=
t deal of confidence'' in people running major companies--up slightly from =
the 15% who felt that way in 1999--the percentage who have ``hardly any'' c=
onfidence in business leaders nearly doubled to 24%, from 13% in 1999.=20
Although there is no concrete evidence yet that Enron is adding to that dis=
enchantment, many fear that the sordid tale will feed suspicions about self=
-dealing by executives and the nexus of influence between companies and pol=
iticians. The BusinessWeek/Harris poll finds that some 79% of Americans bel=
ieve corporate executives put their own personal interests ahead of workers=
' and shareholders', as Enron officials are alleged to have done. Other pol=
ls find similar results. For example, a Gallup Organization poll released o=
n Jan. 16 shows that 61% of those closely following the Enron story believe=
 its executives did something illegal. Says Governor John G. Rowland (R-Con=
n.), head of the Republican Governors Assn.: ``The average guy on the stree=
t sees the Enron mess and says, `Oh, another corrupt corporation.'''=20
Reformers are moving to capitalize on such attitudes. Reacting to the pensi=
on losses suffered by Enron employees, for example, pension-rights and labo=
r groups have ambitious goals to give workers more control over 401(k) plan=
s. Limiting the amount of employer stock in such plans is only the first st=
ep. The AFL-CIO also argues that 401(k)s should be governed like union pens=
ion funds, with boards comprising employees as well as company officials. S=
uch independent oversight could resonate widely. ``There should be outside =
management of retirement funds,'' says Carol Otten, an assistant vice-presi=
dent in the Chicago branch of Commerzbank, a Frankfurt-based bank. ``With t=
he CEO not involved and no company stock in the fund, there wouldn't be thi=
s question of accountability'' raised by the Enron case.=20
Other groups cite Enron as evidence of the need for new regulatory scrutiny=
 of the big accounting firms. They argue that Andersen was lax because it g=
ot larger fees from consulting for Enron than from auditing the company's b=
ooks. This is the rule in the industry, not an exception. In fact, the larg=
e accounting firms last year received just 28% of their aggregate fees from=
 accounting, according to a study by the Investor Responsibility Research C=
enter Inc., a nonprofit group in Washington that represents institutional i=
nvestors.=20
To remedy the problem, some investors want to limit or ban auditors from co=
nsulting for the companies they audit, although the SEC appears little incl=
ined to go along. Others want to require corporations to change their accou=
ntants every seven years. ``Enron has given investors the weapon they've be=
en waiting for to really make something happen,'' says Carol Bowie, the IRR=
C's head of governance research.=20
In addition to reform groups, the pressure from skittish stock investors is=
 having at least a short-term effect on some companies. For example, Kmart =
Corp.'s Jan. 22 bankruptcy filing was triggered in part by Enron-inspired f=
ears. So was Tyco International Ltd.'s decision that day to split into four=
 business units. Tyco CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski says he took the step to reas=
sure the fast-growing conglomerate's investors that its complex financial r=
eporting scheme involved no risky accounting--a move that wouldn't have bee=
n needed if the Enron meltdown hadn't renewed investor skepticism about its=
 bookkeeping.=20
The biggest political question is whether the Enron backlash will suffice t=
o push through campaign-finance legislation. Substantial curbs on campaign =
contributions could have a big impact on the way Washington is run. However=
, that's exactly why opponents are likely to stall any key votes until the =
scandal has died down.=20
The outcome of that battle could feed into the November elections as well. =
So far, there's no evidence that close ties to Enron executives led to any =
unethical actions by the Bush Administration on the company's behalf. But D=
emocrats may try to use the opportunity to taint the President for his clos=
e association with Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. More broadly, they may ta=
p the antiregulatory mood to paint the GOP as captive supporters of unregul=
ated corporate power. ``Obviously, that's the bigger political game here--t=
o tie the Enron albatross around the necks of Republicans who believe that =
government should be less involved in markets,'' says Jerry Taylor, an envi=
ronmental expert at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washing=
ton.=20
Of course, 10 months is an eternity in politics. Events may simply push Enr=
on out of the public consciousness long before autumn. Still, many average =
Americans were suspicious of both corporations and politicians before Enron=
 came along. The company's collapse, and the open question as to whether th=
e government will take steps to guard against future corporate meltdowns, c=
an only add to the public's growing sense of cynicism and mistrust.

Finance: INSURANCE
RUNNING FOR COVERAGE Suddenly, policies to cover execs are growing scarce
By Heather Timmons in New York

Buck naked. That's how many executives and company board members facing mul=
timillion-dollar shareholder lawsuits may feel in the post-Enron era. Feari=
ng an explosion of litigation over alleged executive misdeeds, insurers are=
 retreating from writing Directors & Officers (D&O) policies to cover execs=
 against court costs and fines if they are named in suits ranging from sexu=
al harassment to insider trading. Insurers were already jittery about the g=
rowing number of dot-bomb class actions. Now the Enron Corp. debacle is ``m=
aking everyone in the business recognize the potential severity of D&O loss=
es,'' says John Keogh, president and COO of National Union Fire Insurance C=
o., American International Group Inc.'s D&O unit.=20
Less than a dozen companies--including AIG, Chubb, and Great American--unde=
rwrote 98% of such insurance in the U.S. in 2001. Eight insurers, including=
 Aegis, Lloyd's of London, and St. Paul may face claims from Enron director=
s or officials. Aegis, as lead insurer, could be looking at $100 million al=
one. On Jan. 18, Enron asked the Manhattan bankruptcy judge to make its ins=
urers advance cash to executives and directors for legal fees.
Even before Enron collapsed, all major D&O insurers in the U.S. were taking=
 stock of the business. Lloyd's of London, the third-largest player behind =
AIG and Chubb Corp., has cut back its U.S. D&O operations since early 2001,=
 competitors claim. A Lloyd's spokeswoman would only say: ``We have become =
extremely selective [about whom to insure].''=20
Premiums were slated to increase by 25% to 400% because of the jump in shar=
eholder litigation after the Nasdaq crash, says Willis Group Holdings, a Lo=
ndon insurance broker. And insurers were increasing deductibles. Now they'r=
e drastically scaling back the scope of policies.=20
Typically, companies take out D&O insurance for high-profile execs and boar=
d members. Costs vary by business size and industry. Premiums averaged $242=
,000 a year for utilities in 2000, reports Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an in=
surance-industry consultancy, but were just $67,000 for health-services com=
panies.=20
Now, just getting coverage will be hard. Companies that a few years ago cou=
ld buy all the D&O insurance they needed from one insurer may have to visit=
 8 or 10 to get covered, says Mark Larsen, a consultant with Tillinghast-To=
wers Perrin. Insurers are ``being very stingy with their coverage. They're =
only giving a handful of policies out to their best clients.''=20
Enron is a worst-case scenario for D&O insurers. The pension holders and in=
vestors who have filed suits against the company, its officials, and direct=
ors know they'll get little from Enron, which is bankrupt. Instead, plainti=
ffs' lawyers say, their clients hope to recoup some of their losses on the =
approximately $350 million in coverage that Enron had purchased for its dir=
ectors and execs--which the company had increased substantially after 1999.=
 The insurers will surely fight any claims in court, and it's far from cert=
ain that they'll lose. As a rule, D&O insurance doesn't cover instances of =
fraud or criminal wrongdoing.=20
Insurers deserve some of the blame for their rising D&O risk. After Congres=
s passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995--which, among=
 other things, gave executives a legal safe harbor when good-faith projecti=
ons didn't pan out--insurers thought securities litigation would all but ev=
aporate. They rushed headlong into the D&O market, cutting premiums and off=
ering bonuses such as longer contracts and extra coverage to companies that=
 upgraded their policies. Total available D&O coverage sold annually to U.S=
. businesses rose 70% between 1995 and 2000, to $1.5 billion.=20
Instead, after the Nasdaq crash in spring, 2000, shareholders went on a lit=
igation rampage against tech companies and their investment banks. Securiti=
es class-action settlements more than doubled between 1995 and 2000, to $4.=
4 billion. Average damage awards jumped from $25 million per case to $200 m=
illion in that period. Much of that money ultimately came from D&O coverage=
.=20
Now that Enron makes the market look even riskier, some companies may find =
that they can't afford D&O insurance at all, says Fred Podolsky, CEO of exe=
cutive risk practices at London's Willis Group. If that happens, top brass =
will have more reason than ever to make sure that their company is run well=
. After all, their wallets will be on the line.

Insuring the Boss after Enron
Why Directors & Officers insurance is harder to get and more expensive:
-- Shareholder class actions have more than doubled in 2001 because of the
bear market of 2000, and settlements are getting bigger
-- Lloyd's of London has restricted underwriting in the U.S., Reliance
Insurance filed for bankruptcy, and other major players are tightening
standards
-- The spread of aggressive accounting is making insurers much pickier abou=

BusinessWeek Investor: The Fine Print
The Fine Print: How to Read Those Key Footnotes A new periodic series will =
guide you through accounting issues
By Anne Tergesen

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
94
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The sudden collapse of Enron, until recently the nation's seventh-largest c=
orporation, took investors by surprise. But had the Wall Street analysts, m=
utual fund managers, journalists, and individual investors who followed the=
 company dug a little deeper, they could have had a heads-up that all was n=
ot quite right at the Houston energy giant long before the bad news broke i=
n October. The source of this information? The footnotes companies are requ=
ired to publish with their financial statements.=20
Buried in Enron's annual report for 2000, for example, are hints of the hid=
den debt that pushed the company into bankruptcy in December. A footnote on=
 ``preferred stock'' indicates that if Enron's share price were to fall bel=
ow $48.55--which first occurred on June 14--the company would be obliged to=
 issue stock to a partnership called Whitewing Associates. Other footnotes =
reveal similar arrangements. True, Enron never put a dollar value on its po=
tential obligations, and the footnotes did not divulge the extent of the pa=
rtnerships. But enough was revealed to suggest that investors were not gett=
ing a full view of the company's finances.
As Enron's collapse illustrates, it is vital to look behind the numbers com=
panies release in quarterly and annual financial statements. That's why Bus=
inessWeek Investor is launching The Fine Print, a series in which we will p=
eriodically examine various sorts of footnotes you'll find in company repor=
ts.=20
Footnotes often list items that can greatly affect the bottom line yet are =
invisible on the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash-flow sta=
tement. That's because accountants often combine several items into catch-a=
ll categories, such as ``other income'' or ``other assets.''=20
Take IBM. Nowhere does Big Blue's 2000 income statement credit its pension =
fund for boosting earnings by $824 million, or 7% of pretax income. Yet the=
 pension fund's contribution is spelled out in a footnote. Combined with a =
section of the annual report called ``Management's discussion and analysis,=
'' the footnotes ``give you some powerful information about the story behin=
d the numbers,'' says Lynn Turner, director of the Center for Quality Finan=
cial Reporting at Colorado State University. ``If done right, footnotes wil=
l also give you some good predictive information with respect to where the =
company is headed,'' he adds.=20
Footnotes do not make for easy reading, however, and the numbers are often =
difficult to decipher. In addition, there can be a long lag between the pub=
lication of earnings and the clarifying footnotes. Why? While companies gen=
erally disclose earnings in a press release shortly after the end of each q=
uarter, they have up to 45 days to file quarterly 10-Qs and up to 90 days t=
o release the annual 10-Ks that contain footnotes.=20
There's no cookie-cutter method to extract what's important from the fine p=
rint. The footnote devoted to transactions with related parties was importa=
nt at Enron, for example, but it's not relevant to every company. And you c=
an't assume that one footnote contains all a company has to say about a top=
ic. To investigate off-balance-sheet financing, for example, you must often=
 read several footnotes, including those that detail topics such as related=
 party transactions, minority interests, and unconsolidated affiliates. ``Y=
ou have to interrelate things,'' says Bob Olstein, portfolio manager of the=
 Olstein Financial Alert Fund.=20
Finally, if after reading a set of footnotes you feel more confused than en=
lightened, steer clear of the stock. As Enron's fall illustrates, companies=
 that aren't straightforward risk seeing investor confidence evaporate at t=
he first sign of trouble.=20
We are inaugurating The Fine Print series by examining the footnote for pen=
sion accounting. This footnote is key because, during the bull market, inco=
me from defined-benefit pension plans became a significant source of profit=
s for many companies. Indeed, pretax earnings were lifted by an average of =
12% at the nearly one-third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index that reported pension income in fiscal 2000, says Jane Adams, a =
pension analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Of course, if stock market l=
osses persist, this trend will reverse--with falling pension assets eroding=
 many corporate bottom lines.=20
When a company promises to pay pension benefits to retirees, it takes on an=
 obligation, or liability. Attaching a figure to that obligation is an inex=
act science that involves estimating employees' longevity and future salary=
 levels, among other things. To convert the pension obligation from future =
dollars to a current value, accountants ``discount'' it at an interest rate=
 that assumes the company will settle its obligation by investing in high-q=
uality bonds.=20
This number isn't on the balance sheet. Instead, it is offset by the value =
of the pension plan's investments, adjusted to smooth out some stock market=
 volatility. Depending on whether the plan's obligation or adjusted value i=
s greater, the company records a net pension asset or liability.=20
To find the pension plan's impact on net income, check the pension footnote=
 in the annual report. For Denver-based Qwest Communications International,=
 the note shows that the plan produced a ``net credit''--or addition--to in=
come of $319 million in 2000 (Table 1). Despite this, Qwest lost $81 millio=
n that year.=20
The same table reveals that the biggest contributor to Qwest's pension wind=
fall was $1.068 billion generated by its ``expected return on plan assets.'=
' Accounting rules permit the use of an expected return because relying on =
a day-to-day return would cause net income to jump around with the stock ma=
rket. The bottom half of this table shows that Qwest expects its plan asset=
s to gain 9.4% a year, on average. It increased that rate from an 8.8% proj=
ection in 1999. Given the stock market's doldrums, it's a good bet Qwest di=
dn't meet that goal in 2001.=20
In contrast to Qwest's $1.068 billion expected return, its actual return wa=
s a $78 million loss in 2000, following a $2.5 billion gain in 1999 (Table =
2). If real returns continue to trail expected returns, Qwest may build up =
deferred losses to the point where accounting rules require the company to =
put some red ink on the income statement.=20
Partially offsetting the $1.068 billion gain generated by ``expected return=
s on plan assets'' are two expenses itemized in Table 1, service cost and i=
nterest cost. Service cost represents the pension benefits employees earned=
 during 2000. Interest cost is the annual interest cost on the pension obli=
gation--a figure analogous to interest payments on debt.=20
Check the lower half of Table 1. There you'll find the ``weighted average d=
iscount rate'' used to figure the current value of these expenses, as well =
as the overall pension liability. When this rate--pegged to interest rates-=
-falls, the pension obligation rises, says Janet Pegg, a Bear Stearns accou=
nting analyst.=20
The footnote also indicates if a pension fund is over- or underfunded and t=
hus potentially in need of cash infusions. In Qwest's case, the news is goo=
d. At the end of 2000, its pension plan was worth $13.6 billion (Table 2). =
That exceeded the $9.5 billion (Table 3) it promised to deliver in pension =
benefits by $4.1 billion. (This number appears under ``funded status'' in T=
able 4.) Because Qwest's pension fund is amply overfunded, the footnote sho=
ws no company contribution to the plan in 2000.=20
The days of fat pension gains may be over for Qwest. In part because the pl=
an's actual return for 2000 was negative, the deferred gains--technically c=
alled ``unrecognized net actuarial gains''--stockpiled during the bull mark=
et fell from $4.6 billion to $2.9 billion (Table 4).=20
Deferred gains can arise when actual returns exceed expected returns. Such =
gains are put into a pot, along with gains and losses from other pension it=
ems, such as changes in assumptions about future salaries. If the pot becom=
es big enough, some of it is required to spill over into net income. In 200=
0, Qwest recognized $58 million (Table 1) of its deferred gains--technicall=
y called ``net actuarial gains.'' But with deferred gains dwindling, less w=
ill be available to boost the bottom line in the future, says Pegg. More tr=
oublesome, if the plan's assets continue to shrink, so will the expected re=
turns that nearly erased Qwest's red ink in 2000.=20
It's a good bet that Qwest is not alone. So check the footnotes in those fi=
nancial statements to find out whether an ugly surprise may be lurking in t=
he form of fading pension income.

Economic Viewpoint
ENRON: A POWERFUL BLOW TO MARKET FUNDAMENTALISTS
By Robert Kuttner

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
20
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The deepening Enron Corp. scandal should hose away an entire world view abo=
ut how capitalism is supposed to work. But will the right lessons be drawn?=
 As a political scandal, Enron threatens the Bush Administration. No corpor=
ation was closer to the Bush family and its Republican allies. No corporati=
on was more political in gaming the system to get the rules written in its =
favor. The White House damage-control machinery contends that if the Presid=
ent did not try to rescue Enron on the way down, his hands are clean. The r=
eal scandal, of course, is how the GOP and its broader world view helped En=
ron rig the rules on the way up.=20
The deeper scandal here is ideological. Enron epitomized an entire philosop=
hy about the supposed self-cleansing nature of markets. Republicans are the=
 more devout practitioners of this ideology, but both parties are implicate=
d.
Enron, as a trading enterprise, claimed to be the quintessence of a pure fr=
ee market. In practice, it was up to its ears in cronyism, influence-peddli=
ng, rigging the rules to favor insiders, and undermining the transparency o=
n which efficient markets depend. Transparency, in turn, demands regulation=
 in the public interest.=20
There is no getting around the need for regulation, since capitalism itself=
 requires rules that govern everything from rights to financial and intelle=
ctual property to constraints on opportunistic practices that undermine the=
 efficiency of a market system. If you think capitalism can operate in the =
absence of vigorous, competent, and public-minded government, look at Mosco=
w or Buenos Aires. And government requires politics not corrupted by briber=
y. For it is democratic politics that elects the officials who make and enf=
orce efficient rules--or don't.=20
But for three decades now, the dominant strain of economics from the Univer=
sity of Chicago has been teaching gullible undergraduates and journalists t=
hat there is no such thing as the public interest. Efficient outcomes are j=
ust the aggregation of selfish private interests, and government's main job=
 is to get out of the way. Well, after Enron, these theorists should learn =
some other useful trade.=20
Even conservatives who reject other forms of government intervention grudgi=
ngly concede the need for a Securities & Exchange Commission. Entrepreneurs=
 and traders are not saints. Deregulation is no cure-all, because decisions=
 about which rules to waive are every bit as politicized as the decisions t=
o regulate. We've seen the corruption of deregulation in every imperfect-ma=
rket realm from electricity to banking to copyright law to airlines, hospit=
als, and telecom. None of these is an absolutely efficient free market; eac=
h one requires rules. And in all of these realms, whether they are regulate=
d or deregulated, corporations seek to game the system and rig the rules.=
=20
But Enron took the prize. It not only cooked its books. It used its extensi=
ve political influence to cook the regulatory system itself. When a public-=
minded chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stood in Enron'=
s way, Chairman Kenneth L. Lay paid a call and the offender disappeared. We=
ndy Gramm went from being head of the Commodity Futures Trading Corp. under=
 Bush I to the Enron board. Her husband, Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), helpf=
ully ensured legislation allowing Enron to evade policing either from the C=
FTC or the SEC.=20
At the SEC, Arthur Levitt spent eight years trying to toughen regulation so=
 that corporations would keep honest books and auditors would not also be r=
etained as business strategists and spin-doctors. For this public service t=
o capitalism, Levitt was widely vilified. His successor, Harvey Pitt, came =
directly from lobbying for the accounting firms who were against Levitt's p=
roposed rules.=20
The difference between the Enron scandal and the superficially similar Long=
-Term Capital Management affair is that LTCM essentially operated beneath e=
veryone's radar. Enron, by contrast, worked to take out the radar stations.=
 The Houston company systematically used its ample political connections to=
 rig the rules--on trading, audits, disclosure, and the mechanics of energy=
 markets. The other difference is that LTCM's dupes were ostensibly sophist=
icated consenting adults. In the Enron case, a lot of innocent people got b=
adly hurt.=20
None of this is new--only the particulars are different. The last time we l=
earned the broad lesson that capitalism is not self-regulating, it took a G=
reat Depression that was followed by a reformist Democratic Administration.=
 This time, there are no catastrophic wider effects (yet), and the incumben=
t Republican Administration still champions the ideology of laissez-faire a=
nd the politics of cronyism. But Enron is to the menace of market fundament=
alism what September 11 was to the peril of global terror--a very costly wa=
ke-up call. Our political leaders should pay as much attention to this assa=
ult on the very heart of capitalism as they paid to the other one.

Special Report: The Enron Scandal: COMMENTARY
A Regulator with His Own Conflicts of Interest
By Gary Weiss

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
39
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In his two decades of dedicated service to an array of corporations, Securi=
ties & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt won renown as a legal sc=
holar. But that expertise came at a price--a close identification with the =
interests of his clients. Controversy rages over Pitt's history of legal wo=
rk for Big Five accounting firms, including Enron auditor Arthur Andersen, =
which threatens to undermine his leadership in formulating accounting refor=
ms. And Pitt's conflict-of-interest nightmare may only be just beginning.=
=20
As a partner in the Washington law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jac=
obson, he represented firms and individuals throughout the financial-servic=
es industry. Although most previous SEC chairmen had worked on Wall Street =
or were securities lawyers, Pitt's practice was unique in its sheer size an=
d scope. Securities lawyers say that Pitt thus faces actual or apparent con=
flicts of interest--either can be just as troubling--on a host of issues. A=
nother constraint is equally daunting: Legal ethics forbid him from acting =
on information he obtained from ex-clients. ``It's impossible to see Harvey=
 Pitt as anything but Prometheus bound. Pitt is shackled to a rock, and the=
 harpies are going to come and pick his guts out,'' says Bill Singer, a New=
 York securities lawyer.
The heart of his future difficulties can be found in a single-spaced, six-p=
age document that Pitt filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on M=
ay 24, 2001, after he was nominated to the SEC. It lists Pitt's 112 clients=
 during the preceding two years. Apart from the Big Five accounting firms, =
the list includes major banks, the mutual-fund and securities industry trad=
e groups, brokerages such as Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, t=
he New York Stock Exchange, hedge fund titan Dawson Samberg, and corporatio=
ns such as media giant America Online and its Chairman Stephen M. Case.=20
Virtually all could be affected by SEC work in the coming years. The NYSE i=
s vitally interested in issues affecting its heated competition with Nasdaq=
 and electronic trading networks. Charles Schwab and Datek Online closely f=
ollow issues affecting online trading, and Nasdaq market making giant Knigh=
t/Trimark Group has pressed the SEC not to curtail payments for order-routi=
ng, and weighed in on other trading issues.=20
Pitt has dealt with potential conflicts by hewing strictly to the law. His =
spokesperson, Christi Harlan, notes that ``people can always believe that t=
here is the appearance of a conflict of interest, but in [Pitt's] agreement=
 with the Office of Government Ethics he has agreed not to be involved in a=
ny matter involving former clients for a year [ending in August], which is =
what the law requires.''=20
But potential conflicts won't go away just because Pitt is following the ru=
les. If he takes action concerning former clients--even clients from years =
ago, not on the list--after August, lawyers say he may be seen as either fa=
voring them or bending over backwards to do otherwise.=20
Either way, you ``lose the moral high ground,'' says one securities lawyer.=
 ``You want to avoid the appearance of a conflict as well as a real conflic=
t,'' says Ira L. Sorkin, a former SEC regional administrator and now a New =
York securities lawyer. Sorkin notes that while he has confidence in Pitt's=
 fairness, ``you don't want to create any issues that will call into questi=
on a particular decision. It's something that judges and senior people in g=
overnment avoid.''=20
Pitt has already lost the moral high ground in the No.1 issue on the SEC's =
agenda. His credibility is open to serious question on many other subjects =
vital to the markets. And if Pitt's baggage reduces public confidence in th=
e SEC, it may be time to consider if the price of his expertise is too high=
.

Finance: INVESTING
SHOULD YOU FOLLOW THE INSIDERS? Mimicking their trades in company stock is =
no sure road to riches
By David Henry and Timothy J. Mullaney in New York

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
74
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Most surefire tips for beating the stock market have short lives. They fizz=
le out as soon as people figure out that there is no magic formula for maki=
ng money from stocks. But one concept has had a remarkable run: shadowing t=
he trades of those who have the inside scoop on a company--its executives a=
nd directors. A small industry of publications and Web services has sprung =
up to track their required disclosures to the Securities & Exchange Commiss=
ion since the late-1990s tech boom, when stock became a key part of executi=
ves' compensation. It was not lost on the market at large that many people =
got rich by investing in their own companies. And all the publicity about p=
rescient selling by Enron Corp. brass before the energy company's demise ha=
s given the idea a new push.=20
The idea has broad currency. Many mainstream publications cover the topic, =
including BusinessWeek, which prints data from Vickers Weekly Insider Repor=
ts. Numerous academic studies support the view that an increase in insider =
buying or selling across a sector tends to point to a switch in the market'=
s direction. Insiders at tech and scientific companies in particular seem t=
o have a much better knack for timing the market than ordinary investors. I=
n the months before the Nasdaq hit its March, 2000, peak, techies were sell=
ing actively. Since then, they've sold into shallow, short-lived rallies. A=
 study by researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles and =
New York University shows that a group of insider buyers, most from tech an=
d pharmaceutical companies, beat broad market indexes by an average of 9.6%=
 in the six months following their purchases.
But for individual companies--which is what the bird-doggers really care mo=
st about--there's little solid evidence that insider transactions convey mu=
ch useful information about the near term prospects for a company's stock. =
A close analysis by BusinessWeek of a series of trades shows why: Many fact=
ors, from regulatory restrictions to the ebb and flow of executives' person=
al finances, control the timing of an insider's transactions and mask the m=
otivations. Arguably, an executive who is buying is probably enthusiastic a=
bout his company's prospects, but a big repeat seller could be raising cash=
 for a tuition bill at Harvard University or the downpayment on a ski lodge=
 in Aspen, Colo. And with companies paying an ever-larger part of compensat=
ion in stock options, insiders have more incentive to sell shares to cover =
expenses.=20
Besides, SEC filings on insider traders aren't disclosed to the public unti=
l several weeks after deals occur--when the optimum time to buy or sell may=
 be past. In addition, brokers are increasingly helping insiders camouflage=
 their transactions by offering them private contracts to stop losses or se=
cretly capture gains. Or they may help them schedule trades months in advan=
ce, a tactic permitted by a recent SEC ruling. Moreover, many companies, co=
ncerned about impressions of impropriety, limit when their execs can trade =
so they can't time the market.=20
Studies, such as the one from UCLA and NYU, that appear to support investme=
nt strategies based on insider tracking turn out on closer analysis to be l=
ess-than-rousing endorsements. For instance, the reported 9.6% six-monthly =
lift was skewed by outsize gains at a few companies. When researchers looke=
d at all companies reporting insider trades, buyers only beat the market by=
 3.6% on average. And that average was also unrepresentative. In each case,=
 only half of all insider buyers outperformed the market by more than a tin=
y margin. The study shows that investors would need to mimic hundreds of in=
siders' trades to lock in above-market returns, according to one of its aut=
hors, UCLA Assistant Finance Professor David Aboody. ``You would need an in=
sider fund. An individual investor would lose his pants,'' says Aboody.=20
Even those in the insider-tracking business are willing to acknowledge that=
 their data are ambiguous at best. ``You see investor services promoting th=
at Bill Gates sold a large amount'' of Microsoft stock, says Lon Gerber, re=
search director at Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. ``And it generally m=
eans nothing.''=20
Indeed, even when executives call their company's stock just right, it's of=
ten as much dumb luck as anything else. That became clear in interviews wit=
h a number of insiders identified by Lancer Analytics as having had astonis=
hingly prescient trading patterns over the past 15 years, measured by retur=
ns over the six months following their trades (table).=20
Consider the case of David M. Kies, a director of ImClone Systems Inc., a c=
ompany whose shares plunged after a much-ballyhooed cancer drug failed to p=
ass muster with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. Kies bought ImClone sh=
ares 19 times after joining the board in 1996, and all but once, the stock =
climbed in the next six months. Last October, Kies made his first sale, at =
$70, near the stock's high. Nearly three months later, ImClone shares fell =
below $20. A scared insider bailing? Hardly. Kies sold only 8% of his holdi=
ngs into a $1 billion tender offer by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to raise tax=
 money. ``If I didn't have the tax liability, I just would have held on,'' =
says Kies, adding that he's still a believer in the drug, even though ``I c=
an't say I fully understand the science.''=20
The examples also show that many smart-looking buyers never sell--with unfo=
rtunate results. William A. Friedlander, a money manager who sits on the bo=
ard of telecom carrier Broadwing Inc., made out fabulously for a while. Aft=
er each of his 10 purchases, Broadwing shares rose an average of 23% in the=
 following six months. The 24,000 shares he bought in July, 1999, at $21 ro=
se 80%. Friedlander still owned those shares at $10. Why didn't he sell? He=
 says he was mistakenly convinced that demand for broadband services would =
outstrip supply.=20
Others, like Paul A. Frame, simply got lucky. The CEO of oil services compa=
ny Seitel Inc. sold shares that he had acquired earlier, mostly through opt=
ions, over a decade on 16 different occasions--and in 13 cases the shares w=
ere down six months later. But, he says, he sold on a schedule determined b=
y the company's restrictions on when he could trade, according to company s=
pokesman Russell J. Hoffman.=20
Even many tech insiders get it wrong. Far from being the first to jump ship=
, Nortel Networks Corp.'s execs and directors bought 34 times in the months=
 since October, 2000--a period when the stock plunged by 90%. At Gateway Co=
mputer Inc., insiders have bought a half-dozen times since mid-2001, but mo=
st did so long before Gateway released a weak sales forecast on Jan. 8, whi=
ch pushed the stock down nearly 30% in one day. It has continued to fall. A=
nd Yahoo! Inc.'s ex-CEO Timothy A. Koogle sold $25 million of Yahoo stock l=
ast year, much of it before the shares took off on a 65% rally.=20
The bottom line: Insider tracking is a lot of work, and it's hardly a sure-=
fire technique for making money. A pattern of buying or selling might give =
investors a hint that something's up at a company. But it's still no substi=
tute for dogged research.

THE POST-ENRON WORLD

02/04/2002
BusinessWeek
108
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

A post-Enron era is beginning to take shape, and those chief executive offi=
cers and politicians who miss this change in the culture may find themselve=
s suffering deeply. Enron Corp. clearly crossed the line--but it was a line=
 that much of the country has been walking for a decade. The hyperbolic for=
ecasts that various chief executives fed investors about their companies' p=
rospects became sweeping deceptions by Enron officials. The accounting tric=
ks that companies employed to boost earnings and stock prices became outrig=
ht duplicity in Enron hands. And the campaign contributions spent by many c=
ompanies to ensure favorable government treatment worked only too well in E=
nron's case.=20
The Enron scandal appears to be a watershed event. Polls show a deep underc=
urrent of public distrust in Big Business and its influence in Washington (=
page 34). Investors are already demanding a new veracity and integrity from=
 chief executives and the balance sheets they present. The next impact, how=
ever, may be on the political world as voters question the money connection=
 between Big Business and policymaking. President George W. Bush would do w=
ell to understand the change in the nation and follow his champion Theodore=
 Roosevelt in cleaning up the mess in political finances. As he prepares hi=
s State of the Union message, the President should seize the moment to back=
 campaign finance reform and reassure Americans that they can trust their e=
lected leaders.
Americans want no less from their corporate leaders. The perfidy of Enron e=
xecutives contrasts sharply with the post-September 11 honesty of former Ne=
w York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsf=
eld, who became instant public heroes for their simple and truthful apprais=
als of terrible crises. Compare that to what Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay =
told BusinessWeek on Aug. 20: ``There are no accounting issues, no trading =
issues, no reserve issues, no previously unknown problem issues. The compan=
y is probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been.'' Or c=
ompare that to what former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling said t=
o BusinessWeek on Aug. 23: ``People are afraid there's another shoe to drop=
, but it's just not the case.'' Skilling resigned on Aug. 14, the day befor=
e an Enron vice-president, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote her now-famous memo wa=
rning of an enormous ``accounting hoax.'' Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec=
. 2, destroying the jobs and the retirement savings of thousands of people.=
 Throughout this time, Lay and Skilling were selling their company's stock =
while advising investors and their own employees to buy it.=20
INVESTORS WANT HONESTY=20
In the immediate aftermath of the Enron fiasco, investors already have star=
ted demanding much greater clarity and honesty. Look at Tyco International =
Ltd., which was pressured to split itself into four companies and sell off =
assets because investors were uneasy about the reliability of the company's=
 accounting methods. Even a passing grade by the Securities & Exchange Comm=
ission was not good enough to satisfy these skeptical investors. Meanwhile,=
 the credit-rating agencies are demanding more off-balance-sheet informatio=
n from companies. And stocks may well shift to a two-tier market in which i=
nvestors reward companies that choose to return to conservative accounting =
practices and punish those that don't. The days of slippery pro forma accou=
nting are numbered.=20
Washington should get behind the move toward more transparency and honesty =
in the country's corporate books. The ability of companies to game the enti=
re regulatory process, as Enron did, must be prevented in the future as wel=
l. The Securities & Exchange Commission should be leading the reform effort=
, but it isn't. The attempt of the SEC's chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, to const=
rain rogue accounting firms that enable companies to distort their earnings=
 is pitifully weak. He suggests yet another oversight committee to check pr=
ocedures in a profession that already has a half-dozen such groups, none of=
 which has stopped the many accounting scandals of recent years. Pitt's bac=
kground in representing dozens of major companies, including ones in the ac=
counting industry, in battling SEC regulation make his job all the more dif=
ficult (page 39).=20
THE SEC SHOULD ACT=20
Pitt is unquestionably a man of personal integrity, but he needs to come fo=
rth with a far bolder reform plan. The integrity of our financial markets i=
s at stake.=20
Beyond that, there is no way to ensure honesty in Washington under the curr=
ent system of campaign finance. It is impossible to establish arm's-length =
decisions in the public interest when raising campaign money is constantly =
on the agenda. The Clinton Administration encouraged chief executives to fl=
y abroad with Commerce Dept. officials to pull in overseas contracts. Their=
 goal was laudable: to compete with Japanese and European government effort=
s to help their corporate ``national champions.'' At the same time, though,=
 Clintonites were asking those same honchos flying overseas for campaign co=
ntributions. Enron's Lay flew to India with members of the Clinton Administ=
ration who helped him snag a $3 billion energy contract. He gave generously=
 to Democrats and Republicans alike. Did he get what he paid for? We can't =
know for sure. Which is precisely the point.=20
In the post-Enron environment, Americans are revaluing their financial and =
political assets--and finding both severely depreciated. Investors are alre=
ady betting their dollars on more trustworthy companies and CEOs. Voters ma=
y soon do the same with their political parties and elected officials. TR s=
aid in 1910 that ``our government, national and state, must be freed from t=
he sinister influence or control of special interests.'' After Enron, Presi=
dent Bush should take Teddy's words to heart.

Cliff Baxter had worked hard for all the trappings of a Texas millionaire's=
 life, but the cowboys at Enron had hog-tied his career. Sure, he had the $=
700,000 house in an exclusive suburb of Houston, a new 2002 Mercedes-Benz S=
500 sedan in the driveway and a 72-ft. yacht named Tranquility. With millio=
ns of dollars in the bank, he and his wife had established a charity to hel=
p kids with diabetes and cancer, and Baxter was even considering a new care=
er in teaching. A smart, funny Long Islander who served five years in the A=
ir Force and graduated first in his M.B.A. class at Columbia University in =
1987, Baxter, 43, found his place with a bunch of brash Texans building the=
 energy company of the future and rose to become vice chairman. But long be=
fore Enron went bankrupt, Baxter realized it was shady. Last week that know=
ledge helped drive him to suicide.=20
Known as a straight shooter who helped protect his employees from Enron's c=
utthroat culture, Baxter tried to do the right thing, at least initially. L=
ast spring he warned then CEO Jeff Skilling about the dubious financial pra=
ctices that would eventually be Enron's undoing. By speaking out, he forfei=
ted his chance to become company president. But this was Houston, not Holly=
wood, and Baxter wasn't Russell Crowe in The Insider; instead of going publ=
ic with his concerns, he took his millions and walked away.
Last month he was dragged into the glare. After being named in the leaked m=
emo written by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, Baxter was subpoenaed =
to testify before Congress--which meant he would have to either take the Fi=
fth or betray friends or himself. He was also one of 29 former and current =
Enron officials accused in a shareholder lawsuit of cashing in options befo=
re prices started plummeting last fall; since 1998, he had cashed out $35 m=
illion in stock. The pressure was getting to him--people at his yacht club =
noticed that since December his hair had gone much grayer.=20
Late last week Baxter got into his new $80,000 Mercedes, drove to a median =
strip not far from his home in Sugar Land, Texas, turned the engine off, lo=
cked the doors and shot himself in the head with a single bullet from a .38=
 revolver. A suicide note was found, reportedly pointing to the problems at=
 Enron.=20
Few at the company knew as much about those problems as Baxter, who joined =
Enron in 1991 and rose quickly, under the tutelage of Skilling, in the mark=
eting wing known as Enron Capital & Trade, eventually becoming Enron's chie=
f of strategy. He negotiated dozens of big deals, including the $3 billion =
purchase of the Oregon utility Portland General Electric in 1997. He was al=
so in charge of getting rid of many of Enron's hard assets, like power plan=
ts, around the globe--part of an effort, some insiders think, to raise cash=
 and help shore up the company's ailing balance sheet. Baxter's onetime div=
ision, Enron North America, which sold energy on the wholesale market, ofte=
n did deals off the books with the company's mysterious limited partnership=
s like JEDI II, or Joint Energy Development Investments, which is now under=
 investigation. By the end of 2000, his criticism of some of those deals le=
ft him in the dead-end job of vice chairman.=20
After Baxter's death, Skilling was said to be "devastated." Watkins was "st=
unned." Former Enron lobbyist Joe Allen was "in shock." Baxter's lawyer sai=
d his family, including his widow Carol Whalen and two children, 11 and 16,=
 want "to mourn privately, in peace, with dignity." Friends in Amityville, =
N.Y., where J. Clifford "Cliffie" Baxter grew up as one of six siblings bor=
n to a homemaker mom and police sergeant dad, saw how appearances can decei=
ve. Said Jo Kenny, 66, a friend and neighbor in Amityville: "You think a pe=
rson has achieved so much, but [problems] go much deeper."=20

KENNETH LAY Former Enron chairman=20
Had he resigned only a few months earlier, Lay might have received a "golde=
n parachute" in excess of $25 million. Instead, he departed in shame last w=
eek, and must defend himself from lawsuits and hostile questions during tel=
evised congressional hearings that start Feb. 4. Still, Lay, who helped fou=
nd Enron in 1985 and became its CEO, has received about $200 million in sal=
ary, stock and other compensation from Enron since 1999. He enjoyed privile=
ges rare even for top CEOs, such as the $7.5 million revolving credit line =
Enron extended him, which he reportedly used and repaid with Enron stock 15=
 times between last February and October. Lay will maintain his seat on Enr=
on's Board of Directors, a perch from which, some say, he can keep an eye o=
n the investigators probing the company.
JEFFREY SKILLING Former Enron CEO=20
A week after his surprise Aug. 14 resignation, the media and public, howeve=
r skeptically, had digested Skilling's claim and his colleagues' swift corr=
oboration that the CEO was leaving the company for personal reasons, after =
just six months on the job. Between January and August 2001, Skilling sold =
off about $20 million in Enron stock. He has tried to maintain a low profil=
e--but last week's suicide by former Enron vice chairman Cliff Baxter broug=
ht reminders that, according to whistle-blower Sherron Watkins, Baxter had =
complained loudly to Skilling about Enron's shady bookkeeping.=20
DAVID DUNCAN Former Andersen partner=20
Duncan, who had overseen Andersen's Enron audit since 1997, was fired Jan. =
15 for leading the document-shredding brigade--against company policy, acco=
rding to official statements. His 15 minutes of fame, though, turned out to=
 be less than five--that's the amount of time it took him to invoke the Fif=
th Amendment before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last Thursday.=
 That brief appearance opened the door for the two Andersen executives, C.E=
. Andrews and Dorsey Baskin Jr., who claimed that they found it "appalling"=
 that he seemed to manage the shredding "in anticipation of a government re=
quest for documents." Duncan, a 20-year Andersen veteran, initiated a rapid=
 document-destruction campaign on Oct. 23, they said, the day after the SEC=
's Enron probe became public, and it lasted until Nov. 9, when Andersen rec=
eived a subpoena. Duncan told House investigators that he believes official=
s at Andersen's Chicago headquarters tacitly encouraged shredding as early =
as September.=20
NANCY TEMPLE Andersen lawyer=20
After Duncan declined to answer their questions, the members of the House C=
ommittee on Energy and Commerce made quick work of Temple. Her now well-kno=
wn Oct. 12 e-mail, first reported in TIME, routinely laid out the auditor's=
 policy that explains when nonessential documents such as computer files an=
d e-mail should be kept and when they may be destroyed. But Duncan and Ande=
rsen partner Michael Odom heard the message as a starter's pistol for what =
would become a 17- day document-shredding marathon. Some investigators felt=
 they got a glimpse of Temple's state of mind in a document that emerged la=
st week: Temple told Duncan to remove her name from a memo relating to Enro=
n to decrease the chances she could be a witness, "which I prefer to avoid,=
" she wrote on Oct. 16.=20
THOMAS WHITE Secretary of the Army=20
A former vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, White faced enemy fire las=
t week for his push last year to privatize energy utilities that supply the=
 armed forces. The activist group Public Citizen accused White of making de=
cisions favorable to Enron soon after he officially joined the Bush Adminis=
tration last June. Previously, White drew attention for his Enron holdings,=
 more than 400,000 shares- -by far the largest among Bush Administration of=
ficials--which he sold between June and October for an estimated profit of =
more than $12 million. In those months, he says he had 30 strictly personal=
 calls or meetings with Enron employees.=20
SHERRON WATKINS Enron vice president=20
Corporate-development executives make the unlikeliest folk heroes. But Watk=

First; Value Driven
You're On Your Own That Enron workers lost life savings is just another sig=
n that the short era of economic security is over.

The miserable fate of Enron's employees will be a landmark in business hist=
ory, one of those awful events that everyone agrees must never be allowed t=
o happen again. This urge is understandable and noble: Thousands have lost =
virtually all their retirement savings with the demise of Enron stock. But =
making sure it never happens again may not be possible, because the sudden =
impoverishment of those Enron workers represents something even larger than=
 it seems. It's the latest turn in the unwinding of one of the most audacio=
us promises of the 20th century.=20
The promise was assured economic security--even comfort--for essentially ev=
eryone in the developed world. With the explosion of wealth that began in t=
he 19th century it became possible to think about a possibility no one had =
dared to dream before. The fear at the center of daily living since caveman=
 days--lack of food, warmth, shelter--would at last lose its power to terri=
fy. That remarkable promise became reality in many ways. Governments create=
d welfare systems for anyone in need and separate programs for the elderly =
(Social Security in the U.S.). Labor unions promised not only better pay fo=
r workers but also pensions for retirees. Giant corporations came into bein=
g and offered the possibility--in some cases the promise--of lifetime emplo=
yment plus guaranteed pensions. The cumulative effect was a fundamental cha=
nge in how millions of people approached life itself, a reversal of attitud=
e that must rank as one of the largest in human history. For millennia the =
average person's stance toward providing for himself had been, Ultimately I=
'm on my own. Now it became, Ultimately I'll be taken care of.
The early hints that this promise might be broken on a large scale came in =
the '80s. U.S. business had become uncompetitive globally and began restruc=
turing massively, with huge layoffs. The trend accelerated in the '90s as t=
he bastions of corporate welfare faced reality. IBM ended its no-layoff pol=
icy. AT&T fired thousands, many of whom found such a thing simply incompreh=
ensible, and a few of whom killed themselves. The other supposed guarantors=
 of our economic security were also in decline. Labor-union membership and =
power fell to their lowest levels in decades. President Clinton signed a hi=
storic bill scaling back welfare. Americans realized that Social Security w=
on't provide social security for any of us.=20
A less visible but equally significant trend affected pensions. To make cos=
ts easier to control, companies moved away from defined- benefit pension pl=
ans, which obligate them to pay out specified amounts years in the future, =
to defined-contribution plans, which specify only how much goes into the pl=
an today. The most common type of defined-contribution plan is the 401(k). =
The significance of the 401(k) is that it puts most of the responsibility f=
or a person's economic fate back on the employee. Within limits the employe=
e must decide how much goes into the plan each year and how it gets investe=
d- -the two factors that will determine how much it's worth when the employ=
ee retires.=20
Which brings us back to Enron. Those billions of dollars in vaporized retir=
ement savings were in employees' 401(k) accounts. That is, the employees ch=
ose how much money to put into those accounts and then chose how to invest =
it. Enron matched a certain proportion of each employee's 401(k) contributi=
on with company stock, so everyone was going to end up with some Enron in h=
is or her portfolio; but that could be regarded as a freebie, since nothing=
 compels a company to match employee contributions at all.=20
At least two special features complicate the Enron case. First, some shareh=
olders charge top management with illegally covering up the company's probl=
ems, prompting investors to hang on when they should have sold. Second, Enr=
on's 401(k) accounts were locked while the company changed plan administrat=
ors in October, when the stock was tanking, so employees could not have bai=
led out if they wanted to.=20
But by far the largest cause of this human tragedy is that thousands of emp=
loyees were heavily overweighted in Enron stock. Many had placed 100% of th=
eir 401(k) assets in the stock rather than in the 18 other investment optio=
ns they were offered. Of course that wasn't prudent, but it's what some of =
them did.=20
The Enron employees' retirement disaster is part of the larger trend away f=
rom guaranteed economic security. That's why preventing such a thing from e=
ver happening again may be impossible. The huge attitudinal shift to I'll-b=
e-taken-care-of took at least a generation. The shift back may take just as=
 long. It won't be complete until a new generation of employees see assured=
 economic comfort as a 20th-century quirk, and understand not just intellec=
tually but in their bones that, like most people in most times and places, =
they're on their own.

We're not going to have to tear up the speech, are we?" George W. Bush aske=
d late last week, as his aides labored over the text of Tuesday night's Sta=
te of the Union address. Bush was gently mocking the endless process--and p=
erhaps acknowledging how many reasons there are for last-minute rewrites: a=
 war and a recession, an anxious public, an aggressive opposition party, an=
d above all the fast- moving story of the largest corporate bankruptcy in U=
.S. history--a scandal that has so far defied White House attempts to isola=
te it or explain it away. In the space of five days last week, the story of=
 Enron's collapse went from the merely unusual to the truly baroque, with p=
lot elements lifted from the pages of Robert Penn Warren and John Grisham. =
On Tuesday FBI agents moved in when document shredding was discovered insid=
e Enron's Houston headquarters. On Wednesday Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, until r=
ecently the national cheerleader for a frictionless new economy and a man t=
he President nicknamed "Kenny Boy," resigned in disgrace, forced out by a b=
oard of directors who had apparently been napping for months. One of 11 con=
gressional investigations opened its hearings on Thursday with a tableau we=
 might as well get used to: Enron's former outside auditor taking the Fifth=
 Amendment. On Friday J. Clifford Baxter, 43, an executive who left Enron l=
ast May, was found dead in his Mercedes-Benz in the median of a divided hig=
hway in the fancy Houston suburb of Sugar Land- -an apparent suicide. That =
same day, as if on cue, the White House acknowledged that Bush's top politi=
cal strategist, Karl Rove, had recommended that Enron hire a key G.O.P. con=
sultant during the early days of Bush's presidential campaign five years ag=
o.=20
It was one more intimate link between Enron and the Bush team, one more unw=
elcome story at a time when the President is hoping that his big speech wil=
l change the subject back to heroism and unity and patriotism, the themes t=
hat have helped make him so popular of late. But even Bush's poll numbers--=
playing a game that Enron accountants know so well--are beginning to tell t=
wo different stories at the same time. For a President with two wars to fig=
ht and a 77% approval rating in the new TIME/CNN poll, the Enron story has =
been up to now little more than a bother. The poll shows that most American=
s give Bush high marks indeed for his handling of the war and the terror th=
reat. But when it comes to domestic issues--the economy, health care, the b=
udget deficit--his grades are middling, and Enron is reviving some of Bush'=
s least favorite issues, such as campaign- finance reform, while stoking ol=
d questions about whose side he is on. With 45% of those surveyed predictin=
g the recession is going to get worse, 51% said that Bush cares more about =
Big Business than he does about regular people--an ominous combination for =
the White House. And so last week Bush told about how his mother-in-law got=
 socked by Enron's collapse. As Bush and his team know, the growing links b=
etween the Administration and the company that cooked its books and wiped o=
ut the retirement savings of thousands provide the best ground Democrats ha=
ve had in months for staging fights over issues like tax cuts, the budget a=
nd pension reform--the subjects that are increasingly important to people a=
nd where Bush gets his lowest marks. No wonder nervous Bush aides reached o=
ut last week to at least one prominent Republican who had been critical of =
the Administration and asked him to tone it down. They called allies in the=
 House and told them to keep it to a dull roar.
One night two weeks ago, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer pushed b=
ack from his desk and smiled. The evening news had just ended and, once mor=
e, all the TV stories about Enron dealt with it as an accounting debacle, n=
ot a political one. Fleischer looked over at Tom Brokaw of NBC, whose camer=
as had been shadowing Bush all day, and said, "All right. Did you notice al=
l the Enron stuff that everybody was asking about? Look what made it on the=
 air--the business-scandal side of it."=20
By mid-January, Fleischer and other senior officials assumed they had put t=
he Enron problem behind them. They were mistaken. Over the last year, the B=
ush team had quietly performed a host of political sacraments for the Texas=
 company before it began to go bust, and vice versa: there was the $1.76 mi=
llion in contributions that Enron executives sent to the G.O.P. during the =
2000 campaign; there was the energy policy Vice President Dick Cheney draft=
ed in 2001 after meetings with Enron officials, portions of which seem to h=
ave sprung directly from Enron's wish list; there were ex-Enron chiefs and =
consultants salted around the Bush Administration, from the Army Secretary =
Thomas White to the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. And last sum=
mer Bush chose Pat Wood--a man strongly backed by Lay--to be his top energy=
-price regulator.=20
But when top Enron officers bombarded Washington with dire pleas for help l=
ast fall, something almost unprecedented happened: nothing. Though both sid=
es had been in contact for months on a variety of issues, at the moment the=
 company threw itself down at the mercy of the feds, top officials at Treas=
ury and Commerce said, in effect, "See ya." Even Robert Rubin, the Clinton =
Treasury Secretary who dialed up on behalf of Enron's creditors at Citigrou=
p, was turned away by Bush officials.=20
The we-did-nothing defense bought the White House time, but there were enou=
gh failures in the government's safety net of market, accounting and energy=
 regulation to open the door to more than half a dozen congressional probes=
--and to give some cover to the hundreds of lawmakers from both parties (in=
cluding 212 of the 248 involved in the hearings) who had taken money from E=
nron or its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. By then the White House seeme=
d cocky. For reasons no one can explain, it went through with its plan to m=
ake one of Enron's former lobbyists, former Montana Governor Marc Racicot, =
the new Republican National Committee boss.=20
Each new development had the Democrats rubbing their hands together in anti=
cipation. For months the opposition party had had almost nothing to say, pa=
rtly because the nation was at war and partly because it was keen to align =
itself with a popular President. With nothing much to argue about, the Demo=
crats had nothing with which to distinguish themselves. Worst of all, no on=
e in the country was willing to blame the state of the economy on anyone ot=
her than Osama bin Laden. "You can only do what you can do based on the car=
ds you have to play," said Senator John Breaux last week. "We don't have ma=
ny cards."=20
Then Enron dealt them a fresh hand. The implosion of the huge Texas energy =
firm and the sudden loss of retirement funds for thousands of employees and=
 pensioners opened up all the pathways to Scandalland that had been closed =
since Sept. 11. Every populist conflict in the Democratic playbook has at l=
east a cameo role in the Enron drama: fat cats versus little guys, energy p=
roducers versus energy consumers, corporate secrets versus shareholder demo=
cracy, business-friendly Republicans against lunch-pail Democrats.=20
Last week, when the Congressional Budget Office found that 70% of the feder=
al budget surpluses for this year and the next had evaporated under the wei=
ght of last year's tax cuts, the recession and lower post-Sept. 11 spending=
, it was only a matter of time before someone made Enron a verb. Bush, said=
 Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, is "slowly Enronizing the economy. E=
nronizing the budget. We are taking the same approach Enron used in sapping=
 retirement funds and providing them to those at the very top. That's exact=
ly what Enron did. And I'd sure hate to see the U.S. do that."=20
Looking around for other things to Enronize, the Democrats turned next to c=
ampaign-finance reform. Last week the long-suffering backers of the Shays-M=
eehan bill to eliminate unregulated soft money finally attracted the 218th =
signature they needed to get the stalled measure onto the House floor. That=
 doesn't mean it will pass at all, much less soon. The phrase "discharge pe=
tition" sounds encouraging but permits a vote only on certain Mondays. The =
House rarely, if ever, meets on Mondays. (Got that?)=20
Like teenagers trying to see how far they can get on a stolen credit card, =
Democrats then moved on to energy policy. House minority leader Dick Gephar=
dt, gearing up for a presidential campaign, proposed a new "Apollo project"=
 to make the U.S. energy-self- sufficient by 2010. Last week another White =
House hopeful, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, gave a similar speech, =
calling for Americans to produce 20% of electricity from renewable sources =
by 2020. Both proposals are designed to force the White House to side with =
energy producers and against average Americans. The White House said it is =
sticking with its own energy plan.=20
And when the first Senate hearing on Enron got under way, it felt less like=
 an inquiry and more like a warm, ritual bath designed to soak away the sta=
in of contributions. Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who got $2,000 f=
rom Enron and $11,500 from Arthur Andersen in the past decade, invited form=
er SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, the nation's leading accounting hawk, to do =
the scrubbing and apply the rinses. That gave Senator Robert Torricelli of =
New Jersey, who was until recently the subject of a federal probe into his =
campaign finances, a chance to apologize to Levitt, who had pushed unsucces=
sfully for lawmakers to tighten accounting standards. "Congress did not res=
pond," Torricelli intoned. "We were wrong. You were right."=20
While Senators were making their acts of contrition, Republicans on the Hou=
se side--with a nervous eye on the coming midterm elections- -were trying t=
o score points by publicly flaying some scapegoats. Arthur Andersen auditor=
 David Duncan, who the company says ordered the shredding of Enron document=
s at the giant accounting firm's Houston office, took the Fifth in front of=
 the House Energy and Commerce Committee (but not before briefing the panel=
's investigators behind closed doors). Then Duncan's superiors appeared bef=
ore the committee and tried to pin all the blame on Duncan rather than take=
 responsibility for a "document retention policy" that seemed to encourage =
shredding. Republicans got more than twice as much campaign cash from Enron=
 employees as Democrats did in 2000--$1.7 million compared with $683,000--w=
hich may be one reason the House panel plans on more hearings next week.=20
None of these plot twists brought the story into the West Wing until the Ne=
w York Times reported last week that conservative strategist Ralph Reed had=
 received a $10,000-a-month consulting contract from Enron in 1997 with a l=
ittle push from Rove, who was political adviser to then Governor Bush. Like=
 so much about Enron's business practices, it is unlikely that such an arra=
ngement would have been illegal. But the timing of Reed's Enron work had pe=
ople who know about the finances of fledgling presidential campaigns clucki=
ng. A powerful force among Christian conservatives in the late 1990s, Reed =
was hired by Enron to bang the drum for energy deregulation in Pennsylvania=
 at a time when the Bush team in Austin would have appreciated a low-cost, =
low-profile way of keeping Reed on their side, off their payroll and yet fa=
r from the crowd gathering around Steve Forbes and other conservative rival=
s. If Rove gave Enron a nudge about Reed--"Karl Rove gave Ralph Reed a good=
 recommendation," said press secretary Ari Fleischer, and Rove says he does=
n't recall-- then the young Bush campaign was at least capable of the same =
sort of creative accounting that ultimately brought down Enron in December:=
 finding quiet, off-the-books ways to help itself and its friends.=20
Democrats termed the disclosure serious and promised to investigate. Reed, =
a political consultant in Georgia, points out that Enron tried to hire a De=
mocrat, James Carville, for the same work in 1997--something Carville, no f=
riend of Rove's, acknowledges. And Rove told Time that if he spoke to anyon=
e at Enron about Reed, it might have been only after Reed was hired. An Enr=
on official, meanwhile, who says he and two others made the decision themse=
lves, told TIME they had no contact with Rove about the matter. But a veter=
an G.O.P. organizer who was in contact with Reed in 1997 said Reed told him=
 the Bush campaign had steered business his way--something Rove doesn't den=
y.=20
After a year in office, one thing is clear about Bush's political operative=
s: when they make a mistake, they fix it fast. When their conservative inst=
incts lead them down a path that much of the country isn't keen on, they ar=
e awfully good at changing the subject while holding to their original cour=
se. Which is why Bush, early last week, said his mother-in-law was one of t=
he little people who got screwed by the corporate giant. On a trip to a Wes=
t Virginia machinery shop Tuesday, Bush told workers that Jenna Welch, 82, =
had lost almost all of her $8,000 investment in Enron last year. And he fir=
ed up his own boilers a bit, saying he was "outraged" by what happened at t=
he Texas firm. But the Bush team didn't stop there. By late last week, it g=
ot out a few more iron shields to wedge between the White House and the mes=
s in Texas. On Friday the Administration announced that it had ordered a go=
vernment-wide review of more than $60 million in federal contracts with Enr=
on and Andersen. Mitch Daniels, Bush's budget director, said the move was "=
purely a management issue."=20
Meanwhile, the long-simmering dispute between Dick Cheney and Congress abou=
t the Vice President's energy task force started bubbling again. The Genera=
l Accounting Office, which is as close as Congress comes to having an indep=
endent auditor, announced that it would file a lawsuit against the White Ho=
use this week if Cheney did not fork over the details of his energy task fo=
rce's private meetings with Enron officials. The GAO had postponed the suit=
 after Sept. 11, but when it became clear Cheney had no intention of comply=
ing with its request, or even negotiating, the tiny agency decided to fight=
.=20
Congressional interest in those documents increased last week when House De=
mocrats discovered what they think may be a subtle but significant last-min=
ute change in Bush's energy policy, made before it was submitted to Congres=
s. According to Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, language was adde=
d to the final energy plan that was designed to help Enron with a financial=
ly troubled power-plant project in India. Waxman obtained a copy of an earl=
ier draft of the plan, dated March 30 and written by an interagency group. =
That version, sent to Cheney, included no reference to India's energy outpu=
t, Waxman said. But when Cheney made his final energy plan public in May si=
x weeks later, the proposals included a new section calling for increased e=
nergy production in India. The plan directed the secretaries of State and E=
nergy to work with India to help that country maximize its domestic oil and=
 natural-gas output. The provision was significant because Enron has a cont=
roversial $2.9 billion natural-gas-fired Dabhol power plant in India, but t=
he plant's only customer, the state of Maharashtra, found Enron's prices to=
o high and began buying power elsewhere. Enron was eager to get out of the =
Dabhol investment or get the facility back on line and had sought Washingto=
n's help. Cheney met with Lay on April 17, exactly one month before the fin=
al energy proposals were unveiled. Waxman asked Cheney in a letter late las=
t week to explain how the provision evolved and who recommended it.=20
Waxman's line of questioning is exactly the kind of inquiry that White Hous=
e officials say the public has no patience for. Lengthy probes into the pro=
venance of a few sentences in an already aging federal report, they add, is=
 the sort of duck soup that turned voters off about Washington and politics=
 for much of the Clinton era. Republicans believe this in part because they=
 learned that lesson the hard way. The party's take-no-prisoners wing is st=
ill smarting a bit from 1998, when it did not realize until too late that i=
ts drive for Bill Clinton's scalp did as much if not more harm to their own=
 party than it did to the President's.=20
However much oxygen Enron has pumped into Democrats, it doesn't change the =
fact that Bush has the highest sustained approval ratings in memory--and a =
monumental set of tasks ahead of him. That explains why, after delivering h=
is State of the Union speech Tuesday, he planned to hit the road for two da=
ys selling his proposals to the public. Many are sure to be popular: more m=
oney for defense, intelligence gathering, homeland security and border cont=
rols and more tools for police and fire fighters. If Bush has had to shelve=
 his plans to reform Medicare and Social Security--money is tight, and the =
country is in no mood to experiment with retirement benefits-- that's not a=
n entirely unpleasant outcome. Those waters are treacherous, and many wonde=
red why he ever thought about diving in.=20
Bush will try lots of little things to release the pressure building up in =
the Enron pipeline. He has indicated that he will sign the campaign-finance=
 measure if it ever makes it to his desk. Aides indicated last week that he=
 will also get behind efforts to strengthen the rules that require companie=
s to disclose information about hidden liabilities. He will call on Congres=
s to make sure that employees have ways to diversify their retirement savin=
gs so that other Enrons don't happen. And with unemployment rising, the for=
mer oilman is capping talk of tax cuts and boosting talk about jobs, jobs, =
jobs.=20
But the main valve Bush will open now is the one labeled "war." In that are=
na, the public has given him a free hand to spend whatever he wants, finish=
 off al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, hunt down its cells around the world and buil=
d up U.S. military muscle. He is already moving into the second phase of th=
e war, tracking terrorists in countries like the Philippines, Somalia and S=
udan. Sitting at Camp David two weekends ago, he told his aides he believed=
 that roughly 100,000 al- Qaeda-linked terrorists might still be at large a=
round the world. "We're not going to stop short," he said.=20
All is fair in war and politics, but there are some battlefield tactics the=
 combatants would rather not discuss. Democrats want to take away Bush's fa=
tigues and drag him back to last year, to the days when his presidency lack=
ed a clear purpose. The President wants to go in the opposite direction, wr=
apping the entire country--Democrats included--in a warm, unifying embrace,=
 complete with new proposals to foster volunteerism and charity. Safe insid=
e that hug of unity, he dares the Democrats to break the mood that faced do=
wn terrorism. A senior official predicted to TIME that voters who care abou=
t Enron and its White House ties will lose interest after the next big bomb=
ing raid. If Bush has his way, investigating the Administration's links to =
Enron or challenging his plans for mending the economy will seem as unpatri=
otic as questioning the choice of bombing targets in Tora Bora.=20

The [Enron] Spillover/Karl Rove
Did W.'s Playmaker...
John F. Dickerson

(Copyright 2002)

Karl Rove loves a three-cushion shot. As the President's chief political br=
ain, the Texan, 51, delights in crafting a message or staging a presidentia=
l visit that doesn't just score a political point but also plays to several=
 constituencies at once. So when it was reported in the New York Times that=
 Rove might have steered an Enron contract to Ralph Reed, a G.O.P. kingmake=
r whose support Rove needed, the political elite in Washington, which inclu=
des some longtime enemies, thought that just might be his kind of pool.=20
All the key players involved denied any funny business, but that didn't sto=
p the chatter. It doesn't take much to get people talking about Rove. He is=
 the architect of Bush's two gubernatorial victories in Texas as well as hi=
s presidential race. He has also been the President's tutor, feeding him hi=
stories and biographies to read. Inside the White House he is at the center=
 of every political and domestic policy decision. He helps determine where =
the President spends his political capital, and in an election year when bo=
th houses of Congress are up for grabs, he is watching over hundreds of rac=
es.
Last year Rove was criticized for meeting with officials from several compa=
nies in which he owned a substantial amount of stock. Rove dumped the stock=
s, but there was no way his financial portfolio didn't conflict with his po=
litical one, said critics, including at least one Democratic Congressman wh=
o has called for an investigation. Those holdings included $100,000 to $250=
,000 of Enron shares, which already had Democrats contemplating a look into=
 Rove's relationship with the company. Though he has never worked for Enron=
 and the shares he owned were bought out of his own pocket, last week's dis=
closure that Rove recommended Reed, who was hired by the company, may move =
congressional Democrats to summon him for testimony.=20
That would be a rare spectacle for everyone in Washington who spends time c=
harting and discussing Rove's moves. The top political adviser to every Pre=
sident takes on celebrity status around town, and like those who have come =
before him, Rove doesn't mind encouraging the perception that he has a hand=
 in just about every political deal that goes down. As a result, people ass=
ume that every story they hear about him is true--which is why some insider=
s don't believe him when he insists he didn't pull strings with Enron to he=
lp curry favor with Reed.=20
But some of his denials are worth believing. At the end of the 2000 preside=
ntial campaign, for example, the owlish Rove was suspected as the mastermin=
d behind a scheme involving a stolen videotape of George W. Bush's debate p=
reparations. Many were convinced that Rove had mailed the tape to the Gore =
campaign, hoping strategists there would secretly watch it. Then at just th=
e right moment, Rove would leap out and expose them as sneaks willing to do=
 anything to get ahead. Some in the press even published the whole yarn as =
if it were known to be true. But it was just hooey. A low- level former Dem=
ocrat in a campaign consultant's office was prosecuted and jailed for sendi=
ng the tape. Rove wasn't involved at all. It was a bum rap, but Rove probab=
ly doesn't mind. Those kinds of suspicions are the price he pays for being =
the President's playmaker.=20

The [Enron] Spillover/Ralph Reed
...Do A Favor For A G.O.P. VIP?
Daniel Eisenberg; Reported by Michael Weisskopf/Washington

02/04/2002
Time Magazine

(Copyright 2002)

If Karl Rove did land an Enron consulting job for Ralph Reed, one thing is =
certain: Reed didn't really need his help. Reed's choirboy looks notwithsta=
nding, he was no neophyte trying to get into the business. By the time he s=
tepped down as executive director of the Christian Coalition in April 1997,=
 Reed, now 40, was considered such a shrewd political operator and grass-ro=
ots organizer that any number of FORTUNE 500 firms were knocking on his doo=
r.=20
Still, there is no doubt that the Bush campaign had plenty of reasons to ma=
ke Reed happy. After taking over Pat Robertson's fledgling religious organi=
zation in 1989, Reed turned it into a political force, exercising something=
 close to veto power over the Republican presidential nominee. If Reed had =
signed up with one of Bush's conservative rivals, Bush's White House dreams=
 might have been threatened. But if Reed had too visible a role in the Bush=
 campaign, his right-wing reputation might step on Bush's compassionate- co=
nservative message.
The answer may have been to have Reed play an informal, behind- the-scenes =
role in the campaign while earning a tidy sum working for one of Bush's mos=
t dedicated supporters. Late last week the White House confirmed that Rove =
did indeed recommend Reed to officials at Enron in 1997. Both Reed and Rove=
, however, vehemently deny that this was part of any kind of deal to secure=
 Reed's backing. Reed insists he was not even aware that Rove had put in a =
good word for him and claims that he had pledged his support to Bush as far=
 back as April 1997, five months before he was hired at Enron. "I was alway=
s going to be with him," Reed told TIME. "The idea this [Enron job] was an =
additional inducement is not only untrue, it's insulting." He also dismisse=
d any notion that the Bush campaign had to keep him at a safe distance, cit=
ing dozens of campaign and TV appearances as evidence to the contrary.=20
Reed definitely paid dividends for Bush on the campaign trail. After the ca=
ndidate's stunning loss to John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, Reed's=
 firm came to the rescue in South Carolina, bombarding the state's 400,000 =
religious conservatives with negative phone calls and mailings about the ma=
verick candidate from Arizona. Bush won handily.=20
Reed was almost as successful at Enron. He spent most of his time advising =
the company on how best to drum up support for energy deregulation. He made=
 about $10,000 a month for 12 to 18 months of work, focusing initially in P=
ennsylvania, and Enron got much of what it wanted from the state, which der=
egulated its electricity market without making California's costly mistakes=
. But even Reed couldn't help Enron persuade the state to let it immediatel=
y compete for the customers of incumbent utility PECO Energy.=20
This isn't the first time Reed has been in hot water. During the 2000 presi=
dential campaign, his firm publicly apologized for lobbying a Republican ca=
ndidate on behalf of Microsoft, which was hoping to get a better hearing fr=
om a new Administration. The candidate, of course, was one of Reed's other =
clients at the time--Governor George W. Bush.=20

--By Mitch Frank. With reporting by Sally B. Donnelly/Washington
AUDITING LAWS=20
"We were wrong." When Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey said those words=
 in a hearing last Thursday, it marked a dramatic turnaround. For years, Co=
ngress has aided the accounting industry's efforts to avoid new auditing ru=
les. Torricelli is one of many lawmakers (including Connecticut Senator Joe=
 Lieberman) who have pressured the SEC several times over the past decade t=
o back off on tougher regulations for auditors. Clinton-appointed SEC chair=
man Arthur Levitt tried to enact rules that would have kept firms from audi=
ting and consulting for the same clients and forced companies to publicly d=
isclose more liabilities, such as executive stock options. Each time Congre=
ss quashed Levitt's efforts. But that opposition was gone at last week's he=
aring. "Perhaps the era of self-regulation is over," said Tennessee Senator=
 Fred Thompson. But President Bush's SEC chairman, Harvey Pitt, doesn't sha=
re Levitt's concerns. As a lawyer and lobbyist for the accounting industry =
for more than 20 years, Pitt led the fight against Levitt's proposals. Now =
he's pressing for a new industry-funded oversight board. But the current bo=
ard never flunked an auditor in 25 years of peer reviews. Pitt's proposal "=
lacks teeth and independence," says Levitt. The Senators may be talking abo=
ut stricter regulation in televised hearings, but they're not proposing man=
y bills. Will their change of heart last long enough to result in real acti=
on?=20
401(K) REFORM=20
It's impossible to find anyone on Capitol Hill these days opposed to new pr=
otections for 401(k)s. No members of Congress want voters to think they don=
't care about Enron employees who watched their retirement savings disappea=
r into a black hole of creative accounting. Talking of how his mother-in-la=
w lost $8,000 in Enron stock, President Bush put together a Cabinet team to=
 study the issue. Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine are pushing a bill=
 that would limit the amount of an employer's stock in its 401(k) plan and =
ease restrictions on how soon employees could sell it. Boxer only had to du=
st off a similar bill she proposed in 1997, when Texas retailer Color Tile =
went bankrupt. No one is vocally opposing the Boxer- Corzine bill--yet. "Th=
ere's a lot of shrapnel up here," says a Senate staff member. "People are k=
eeping their heads down." But businesses and their lobbyists don't like the=
 idea, arguing that the restrictions would push employers to stop offering =
matching contributions. They fought Boxer's 1997 bill until it quietly died=
 in committee. One person keeping quiet is Phil Gramm, usually a leading op=
ponent of such restrictions. Gramm's wife Wendy served on the audit committ=
ee of Enron's board, and the Texas Senator has recused himself from Enron m=
atters. His fellow Republicans are also holding their fire, for now.=20
ENERGY DEREGULATION=20
Anyone who watched both the struggle to keep the lights on in California an=
d the implosion of Enron might be getting cold feet about deregulation. Not=
 Joe Barton. The Texas Congressman, who chairs the House subcommittee on en=
ergy, hopes to get a bill further deregulating public utilities to the floo=
r by the end of next month. Barton and other proponents see Enron as an iso=
lated example. The White House has no plans to hold off on its energy bill =
and proposals for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Opponent=
s are adding Enron to their arguments, though no one new is fighting the bi=
ll. But the scandal has won converts to government oversight of energy-futu=
res trading. Enron had persuaded Washington not to monitor the trades.=20
CAMPAIGN FINANCE=20
Enron broke the logjam on the long-stalled campaign-finance bill. House spo=
nsors obtained 218 signatures--including those of 20 Republicans--last Thur=
sday to force the G.O.P. leadership to take it to the floor. Charles Bass o=
f New Hampshire provided a key Republican signature last week after failing=
 to persuade Speaker Denny Hastert to allow debate. The bill still faces a =
tough vote; House majority whip Tom DeLay plans to fight it. But the 186 Re=
presentatives and 71 Senators who took Enron money may find the bill the ea=
siest way to wash their hands. Opponents hope that Bush will veto it.

The [Enron] Spillover
Under The Microscope; After Enron, investors are looking more skeptically a=

As questions swirled around its accounting practices, Tyco International, a=
n industrial and services conglomerate with $36 billion in annual revenues-=
-and a beaten-down stock price--said last week it would split into four com=
panies in a bid to "unlock tens of billions of dollars of shareholder value=
." The company's combative CEO, Dennis Kozlowski, predicted the breakup wou=
ld add 50% to the stock price. Going him one better, Don MacDougall of J.P.=
 Morgan Chase said the move would make the stock worth $80 to $90 a share--=
 double the current price. Haven't they heard? Post Enron, any hint of ques=
tionable accounting is the functional equivalent of finding asbestos in eve=
rything a company makes. So a day that dawned with promise for Kozlowski qu=
ickly turned to loss. By week's end Tyco shares were at $45, down 3% from t=
he day before its breakup was announced--and down 24% since fresh accountin=
g worries surfaced at the start of this year.=20
Kozlowski insists that "Tyco has better disclosure in its financial stateme=
nts than anybody out there." Almost two years ago, the company emerged from=
 an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry with no action agai=
nst it, and in an unusual step, the SEC has put out word that no new inquir=
y is under way at Tyco. But while there appears to be nothing illegal about=
 Tyco's bookkeeping, jumpy investors are suddenly setting a higher standard=
. They want to see clearly how a company earns, spends and invests. And Tyc=
o--despite its planned reorganization--remains a complex conglomerate, with=
 headquarters in tax haven Bermuda. Many investors feel it still doesn't re=
veal enough. Says James Chanos, president of hedge fund Kynikos Associates:=
 "Investors just have to exercise a fair amount of diligence when looking a=
t companies that appear confusing."
In a financial world shaking from the Enron scandal, many investors are vie=
wing with fresh skepticism the bookkeeping methods of a range of companies,=
 including even blue chips that are widely admired and accused of nothing i=
llegal. Some of the companies that investors point to are American Airlines=
, the insurer American International Group, Coca-Cola, Electronic Data Syst=
ems, General Electric, IBM, J.P. Morgan Chase and Xerox.=20
These marquee names say it all. Even companies once considered above suspic=
ion are being subjected to increasing scrutiny. Under current accounting ru=
les, management can essentially do whatever it pleases, says David Dreman o=
f Dreman Asset Management, based in Jersey City, N.J. It can scatter explan=
ations in impenetrable footnotes it is confident no one has the time or cap=
acity to decipher. "There are enormous overstatements of earnings and under=
statements of expenses," he says.=20
Enron's unraveling can be traced to investors' first whiff of "off- balance=
-sheet" partnerships that hid billions of dollars of the company's liabilit=
ies. By the time Enron crashed, it was primarily a trading firm. It had rel=
atively few hard assets to cushion its fall when business faltered and hidd=
en debts came due. The risks aren't nearly so great at asset-rich companies=
 like Tyco and GE. But, as with Enron, seasoned analysts have trouble deter=
mining whence, exactly, they derive their profits.=20
Since the Enron fiasco blew wide open, the influential Moody's Investors Se=
rvice has requested additional information from some 4,000 companies that u=
se accounting methods that Moody's believes make it harder to judge their c=
reditworthiness. Companies are also deciding on their own that confusing bo=
oks just aren't worth it. Last Wednesday, Bank of America went to great len=
gths to explain a $418 million gain in the fourth quarter from a subsidiary=
 set up last year to deal with problem loans. The gain resulted from tax sa=
vings after bad loans were shifted to the subsidiary. Not wanting an Enron-=
like taint, the bank clearly spelled out to analysts the legal maneuver, an=
d investors rewarded the extra disclosure by pushing the stock up 4% in a w=
eek.=20
K Mart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, announc=
ed on Friday that it was looking into internal accounting issues. The compa=
ny offered no details. But the accounting getting closest scrutiny in the w=
ake of Enron generally falls into three categories:=20
REVENUE RECOGNITION The SEC says its No. 1 line of inquiry is into the ways=
 that companies book their sales. The most glaring example of revenue fraud=
 occurred at Sunbeam five years ago. (The company's infamous former CEO, "C=
hainsaw" Al Dunlap, just last month settled a shareholder suit stemming fro=
m his stint at the small-appliance maker.) Sunbeam recorded the sale of gas=
 grills and other goods well before they left the warehouse. Many of the it=
ems never did get shipped. By offering retailers deep discounts to place or=
ders months before they normally would and by booking those sales immediate=
ly, Dunlap was able to show escalating revenue and earnings. Eventually, th=
ough, the scheme collapsed as retailers couldn't sell enough appliances eve=
n at discount prices and had to cancel orders.=20
The SEC warned Xerox three weeks ago about booking sales of copiers that, t=
echnically, are leased, not sold. Revenue from a lease is generally reporte=
d over the life of the lease, not up front. Xerox has said it will contest =
the SEC on this issue.=20
Some telecom companies are getting a second look, partly because more than =
a few use Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, but also because many achieved =
their once spectacular growth partly by immediately recognizing revenue fro=
m long-term contracts, analysts say. Qwest has received the most attention =
because its merger with US West opened the door to other accounting issues.=
 Qwest has denied that it did anything wrong. "Think about a bottle of wine=
," former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt said in a speech two years ago. "You w=
ouldn't pop the cork on that wine before it was ready. But some companies a=
re doing this with their revenue, recognizing it before a sale is complete,=
 before the product is delivered to a customer or at a time when the custom=
er still has options to terminate, void or delay the sale."=20
MANAGED EARNINGS Critics of Tyco, which has bought hundreds of companies ov=
er the years, charge that it inflates write-downs for the costs of its acqu=
isitions, in effect creating stored earnings it can summon at will to pump =
up quarterly results in a way that makes earnings growth appear to be the r=
esult of expanding sales or higher margins. These allegations are "totally =
inaccurate," Kozlowski says. But those denials aren't persuasive to David T=
ice, who runs the Prudent Bear Fund and practices short selling, a techniqu=
e that bets on a stock to fall. He has sold Tyco stock short and asserts th=
at Tyco's core growth rate is just 7% or so a year--not the 15% to 20% that=
 the company reports.=20
While investors sort that one out, they can also look at GE, famous for its=
 steadily rising earnings and steadily rising stock price. GE is an acquisi=
tive conglomerate known for reporting one- time gains and one-time losses i=
n striking balance, keeping growth on a calm and steady course. The company=
 has also benefited from earnings that flow from its overfunded pension pla=
n. Last year, with the broad stock market down 13%, GE reported a whopping =
$1.7 billion of income from pension-plan investments. How could that be? He=
re's one possibility cited by stock analysts: by raising the estimated rate=
 of return on the money set aside to fund employee pensions in the future, =
a company can immediately cut the amount of money it sets aside and let tha=
t flow to the bottom line. But if the higher returns never materialize, the=
re will be an earnings hit later on. GE denies that it manages its earnings=
. "I don't want to be painted with that brush," CEO Jeffrey Immelt told ana=
lysts last week.=20
Stock analysts also question the pension accounting of IBM, which two years=
 ago assumed a 9.5% rate of return on pension investments and has upped tha=
t expected return to 10%. IBM has said the increase was based on its experi=
ence in managing the fund.=20
Insurance companies routinely set aside reserves for future claims. Because=
 insurer AIG has posted steadily rising profits for years, some analysts be=
lieve the company may over-reserve in good times and use the stored earning=
s to pump up results in bad times. AIG has said its policy for setting asid=
e reserves is appropriate and fully disclosed in regulatory filings.=20
Cisco has come under the lens, as have a slew of other tech companies, for =
its use of so-called pro forma earnings, which may leave out recurring expe=
nses and are often referred to as "earnings before all the bad stuff." Last=
 year Cisco asked investors to ignore a $2.2 billion charge for inventory l=
oss, which most accountants consider to be a normal business expense rather=
 than something extraordinary.=20
HIDING DEBT This is where Enron got into trouble. Yet hundreds of companies=
 shift liabilities off their books without breaking any laws or accounting =
rules. Many, like Enron, use special-purpose entities (SPE) that, as long a=
s the entities receive at least 3% of capital from outsiders, can be left o=
ff the consolidated books of a parent company.=20
There are other ways to hide debt. In the 1980s Coke divested most of its b=
ottling operations and saddled them with most of the parent company's long-=
term debt. Coke kept stakes of just under 50% in the bottlers, giving it th=
e leverage to force price increases for syrup even when the bottlers couldn=
't pass on those costs. Coke's large ownership interest means that it is on=
 the hook for much of the bottling companies' liabilities, yet the bottlers=
' debts do not show up on Coke's balance sheet. For that reason, some analy=
sts consolidate the bottlers with Coke in looking at the company's financia=
l picture.=20
Liabilities can also be covered over with extensive lease agreements. Both =
United and American airlines owe billions of dollars on long-term leases fo=
r aircraft. Those are real obligations but do not show up as debt. Data pro=
cessor EDS is potentially liable for $500 million in financing costs for co=
mputers that its customers use- -an item that appears only in a footnote to=
 a company report. And J.P. Morgan Chase has a nearly $1 billion liability =
as a 49% partner in an SPE called Mahonia that traded energy contracts with=
 Enron. In accounting, there's always more than meets the eye.=20

The Incredible Shrinking Businessman Corporate titans are out. Government r=
eforms are in. Is it the dawn of a new era?

When a rock-ribbed conservative columnist at the Wall Street Journal and th=
e man who was Bill Clinton's chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion use the same sweeping adjective to describe a situation, you know they=
're talking about something serious. Testifying before the Senate Governmen=
tal Affairs Committee last week, Arthur Levitt, former head of the SEC, ide=
ntified the Enron affair with "an emerging crisis of systemic confidence in=
 our markets." Three days earlier, Robert L. Bartley had written in the Jou=
rnal of the "systemic failure" at the root of the matter, one that touched =
"Directors suspending their ethical guidelines... Accountants and lawyers s=
tudiously looking the other way... Wall Street analysts failing in their pr=
incipal duty."=20
It's the sense that Enron represents the failure of a system, not just of a=
 Texas oil-and-gas-and-cybertrading company, that gives the case its weight=
. In capitalism's 700-year history, financial scandals are two a penny. As =
detailed in Charles Mackay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madnes=
s of Crowds, some of them had far more devastating impacts than Enron's col=
lapse ever will. John Law's Mississippi Co., for example, bankrupted 18th c=
entury France, until Law was chased out of Paris and songs were sung in the=
 streets advocating "the application of all his notes to the most ignoble u=
se to which paper can be applied." From Credit Mobilier to Cendant, from Ja=
y Gould to Ivan Boesky, under Republican Presidents and Democratic ones, wh=
erever and whenever there is a chance to make a dishonest buck, someone wil=
l take it.
Enron stands out from this sorry list not by virtue of the company's size b=
ut because the scandal is of such a fundamental nature. At the heart of cap=
italism is the act of investment, which is nothing more than a decision by =
one party to lend money to another in the hope of a return. The system can'=
t function without trust--trust that the money so lent will not be stolen o=
r applied to illegal purposes, and trust that an enterprise's accounts will=
 accurately reflect the state of its business. Company directors, lawyers a=
nd accountants are said to have "fiduciary" duties--the word derives from L=
atin for trust--that place upon them obligations to do more than collect fe=
es and salaries.=20
Time was when investors were drawn mainly from those rich enough to look af=
ter themselves. But those days are long past. From 1989 to 1998, the number=
 of Americans who invested in shares--either directly or through mutual fun=
ds, savings accounts and retirement plans--grew from 52 million to 84 milli=
on. Enron matters because those charged with the trust of such investors--m=
any of them new to the markets-- let them down. A system that has brought u=
nimagined prosperity cannot survive if such betrayals become commonplace.=
=20
The scandal may prove to be systemic in a broader sense. For reasons that a=
re well understood--the years of turmoil between John Kennedy's assassinati=
on and Richard Nixon's resignation, the end of the cold war, the absence of=
 a sustained national emergency that required a strong Federal Government--=
the authority of the American political process has been in a long decline.=
 At the same time, the reputation of U.S. business leaders has grown extrao=
rdinarily. In the 1980s and '90s, Lee Iaccoca, Sam Walton, Bill Gates, Andy=
 Grove, Jack Welch and their ilk became our new heroes. Businessmen seemed =
to combine a buccaneer's spirit with a slide-rule mind. "Washington" (the w=
ord had to be said with a sneer) was, by comparison with the worlds of our =
titans, disorganized and inefficient, quite hopeless.=20
Not long ago, many would have placed Enron's Ken Lay--innovative, daring--i=
n the pantheon of American business. That such a judgment could be made by =
those not otherwise known for idiocy places our value system into question.=
 The task of companies is to provide returns for investors and so create jo=
bs and spread wealth. But by the '90s, top businessmen had become celebriti=
es, writing books (or having them ghostwritten), gracing covers of magazine=
s and preaching the wonders of American management and transparent accounti=
ng practices to companies in other countries. After Enron, the audiences ov=
erseas for heroes of glamour capitalism may diminish; meanwhile Americans h=
ave become appreciative of safety and security--for themselves and their mo=
ney. At such a time, it's natural to look to government, not institutions d=
riven by the imperatives of the market.=20
The Enron affair matured into a scandal just as it began to seem that the c=
ulture of celebrity was defunct; suddenly, we remembered that Barbra Streis=
and was not a political philosopher. Neither is Jack Welch or Bill Gates or=
, certainly, Ken Lay. In the '90s, we treated businessmen as if they were f=
ilm stars (and we treated film stars like gods). But we lend stars our affe=
ctions only; we lend businessmen our chance of future prosperity. A lesson =
from Enron: we would be wise to entrust that responsibility to those with t=
heir feet on the ground, not on a pedestal. Even if we built it for them.

The [Enron] Spillover/K Mart's Fall
Blame Enron?

(Copyright 2002)

There are plenty of management shortcomings to blame for K Mart's bankruptc=
y. But the discount chain got a good shove from the Sept. 11 attacks--and f=
rom Enron. Here's how:=20
Most states require large companies like K Mart to buy commercial surety bo=
nds, which guarantee, among other things, worker's compensation payments to=
 employees hurt on the job. During the roaring '90s, when risk wasn't a fou=
r-letter word, sureties were relatively inexpensive and were used for many =
purposes. But as the economy slowed, especially after Sept. 11, more and mo=
re companies defaulted, leaving insurers the bill.
Enron, which insured future gas deliveries with surety bonds, left J.P. Mor=
gan Chase the task of claiming $2.5 billion from insurers that are fighting=
 the bank in court.=20
Many insurers in December decided to reduce their exposure to the surety-bo=
nd market. That helped create a supply shortfall, and insurers asked credit=
-starved companies like K Mart and United Airlines to pony up cash collater=
al for their sureties--cash that K Mart did not have.=20
Wal-Mart and Target have good credit--and no surety problems. While there i=
s no indication that surety will tip another company into bankruptcy--as K =
Mart claims--their cost is rising and scarcity increasing.=20
